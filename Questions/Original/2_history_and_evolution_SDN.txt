(A) Introduction of new services -*
(B) Reduction of expenditures -*
(C) Easier configuration and management
(D) Improved security

Question 12. What types of functions were enabled by active networks? Select all that apply.
(A) Packets carrying code in the payload could be executed on intermediate nodes in the network (e.g., routers, switches) -*
(B) A single node in the network could perform more than one function on a packet or stream of packets (e.g., firewalling, followed by load balance). -*
(C) Code installed on nodes in the network (e.g., at routers and switches) could process packets. -*
(D) Code running on end hosts (e.g., machines sending and receiving packets) could modify packet contents.
(E) All routers in the network needed to support active networks for active networks to be deployable.

Question 13. Which of the following is true about network virtualization? Select all that apply.
(A) Network virtualization requires every router and switch in the network to run custom technology supporting virtualization.
(B) Network virtualization requires the instantiation of virtual machines at each intermediate node (e.g., switch, router) in the network.
(C) Network virtualization allows multiple service providers to share the same underlying physical infrastructure. -*
(D) Virtual networks can be realized by dividing switch forwarding tables based on fields in the packet header (e.g., IP address and port). -*
(E) Network virtualization was invented in the late 2000s to support the migration of virtual machines in data centers.

Question 14. Which of the following are true about various systems developed for central control of packet-switched networks? Select all that apply.
(A) Ethane's initial goal was to support authentication of hosts in enterprise networks. -*
(B) The RCP could be deployed within a single ISP network, without coordination across multiple ISPs. -*
(C) The FORCES protocol is deployed on most major routers and switches today.
(D) The OpenFlow protocol requires vendors to expose the details of how they implement flow table maintenance in their switches.
(E) The Routing Control Platform requires changes to existing routers to support central control.

Question 15. Which three artifacts and lessons that active networks affected the development of software-defined networks? Select all that apply.
(A) programmable functions -*
(B) distributed state management
