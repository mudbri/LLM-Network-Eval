(B) Dropping packets -*
(C) Counting packets -*
(D) Classifying packets into different priority queues -*

Question 116. Which of the following are true about programmable data planes in Click? Select all that apply.
(A) Click elements cannot perform common data plane operations such as TTL decrement or checksum computations.
(B) Data-plane processing in Click is limited to a fixed set of elements provided by the software.
(C) Click elements can be composed to perform complex functions, such as the forwarding at an IP router. -*
(D) Click configuration is a simplified version of Python.
(E) Click elements can be composed to perform complex network-wide functions, such as shortest paths or BGP routing.

Question 117. Why does a RouteBricks server assign one core per queue?
(A) Having multiple cores accessing the same queue would require each core to perform only one function in the packet processing pipeline, which is inefficient.
(B) Having multiple cores accessing the same queue would require locking to prevent concurrent memory accesses, slowing packet forwarding performance. -*
(C) Having multiple cores accessing the same queue might create the possibility that there is a queue that is not served by any cores.
(D) Cores have heterogeneous performance, and packets are different sizes, so it makes sense to assign less powerful cores to queues that have smaller packets.

(A) Ethernet GRE tunnels -*
(B) Large packet buffers that hold multiple packets that can be read with a single read -*
