(B) The ability to evolve an existing control protocol without breaking interoperability.
(C) The ability to run a switch independently from the controller.
(D) The ability to support multiple protocols running in parallel on the same hardware.

(A) Constructing a graph of dependencies between different logical tables.
(B) Translating rules to physical tables.
(C) Verifying that the description of packet parsing is consistent with the behavior of an existing hardware switch (e.g., a legacy OpenFlow switch). -*
(D) Translating a packet processing specification to a state machine. -*
(E) Mapping logical tables to underlying switch resources.

Question 82. Which of the following best describe the relationship between a language like P4, an assembler like NetASM, and target programmable hardware (e.g., RMT)?
(A) P4 is much more amenable to "cost semantics" (i.e., figuring out how much a particular operation would cost in terms of power or area) than NetASM.
NetASM and P4 are two examples of high-level programming languages; they are interchangeable.
(B) P4 has verifiable semantics, whereas NetASM does not.
(C) A language like P4 would "compile" to an assembly language like NetASM, which would then specify a one-to-one relationship with resources on the target forwarding hardware. -*
(D) A language like NetASM would "compile" to an assembly language like P4, which would then specify a one-to-one relationship with resources on the target forwarding hardware.

(C) Locally contained applications forward packets more slowly than their stateless counterparts.
(D) A locally contained application can implement SDN logic without ever requiring a packet to be sent to the controller. -*
(E) Locally contained applications allow the hardware pipeline to make switch-local state modifications. -*

Question 86. What are some examples of optimizations that a compiler could perform on NetASM instructions? Select all that apply.
(A) Preventing bufferbloat for real-time application traffic.
(B) Forwarding packets for high-volume flows at higher rates.
(C) Composing or decomposing tables to save either on table size or table width. -*
(D) Only instantiating hardware resources (e.g., table entries) for flows that actually have nonzero traffic volume. -*
(E) Reordering instructions so that subsequent tables need not be as large (e.g., not storing state for unmatched packets). -*
