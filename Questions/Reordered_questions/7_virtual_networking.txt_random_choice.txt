(B) Often deployed in data center networks to allow multiple tenants to share physical network infrastructure. -*
(C) Separates the data and control plane.
(D) Refactors network control so that network behavior is controlled from a single logically centralized controller.
(E) Abstracts the details of the physical network. -*

Question 55. Which of the following are possible ways of creating virtual links in a virtual network? Select all that apply.
(A) VLAN switching based on a VLAN tag. -*
(B) A wide-area tunnel, whereby an Ethernet packet sent between two virtual machines is encapsulated in an IP packet. -*
(C) Longest-prefix match forwarding on an IP router.
(D) A wide-area tunnel, whereby an IP packet is encapsulated in an MPLS tunnel by attaching an MPLS header to the packet. -*
(E) Pairs of virtual Ethernet interfaces, where one end of the Ethernet interface pair resides in the virtual environment, and the other resides in the root namespace on the host machine. -*

Question 56. Which of the following are true of the Mininet network emulator? Select all that apply.
(A) Mininet only allows users to create three types of topologies: linear, tree, and single-switch topologies.
(B) It requires running OpenFlow-capable switches.
(C) It can create an emulation that runs across multiple physically distributed nodes.
(D) All of the hosts in the topology must run the same underlying operating system. -*
(E) It is difficult to use it to route traffic for real services. -*

Question 57. What are the benefits of emulation as opposed to, say, simulation? Select all that apply.
(A) An emulator makes it possible to "port" experiments from one machine to another. -*
(B) An emulation will complete faster than a simulation.
(C) Every run of the emulator will yield exactly the same results, resulting in reproducible experiments.
(D) An emulator allows the experimenter run real software on each of the nodes in the emulation. -*
(E) An emulation is easier to debug than a simulation.

Question 58. Which of the following are possible in Mininet? Select all that apply.
(A) Assigning custom IP addresses to each node in the topology. -*
(B) Running performance measurement tools (e.g., iperf, wget) between nodes. -*
(C) Assigning IP addresses to each node in the topology using a DHCP server. -*
(D) Measuring the latency between a host in San Francisco and a host in Los Angeles.
(E) "Shaping" a link between two nodes to a particular traffic rate. -*

Question 59. Which of the following functions does FlowVisor enable? Select all that apply.
(A) Allowing two controllers to control traffic on distinct VLANs. -*
(B) Allowing one controller to control TCP traffic and one controller to control UDP traffic. -*
(C) Allowing two different researchers to implement and deploy different Web load balancing applications for port 80 traffic.
(D) Allowing two different researchers to implement and deploy different load balancing applications for all traffic between the same source-destination pair.
(E) Allowing two different researchers to implement and deploy control mechanisms for two distinct applications. -*

Question 60. Which of the following are stated applications of the Nicira Network Virtualization Platform? Select all that apply.
(A) Dynamic workload placement in multi-tenant data centers. -*
(B) Central management of security policies. -*
(C) Creating more than 1024 virtual networks, as opposed to the alternative of using VLAN tags. -*
(D) Allowing experimental protocols to coincide with a production network.
(E) Easier transition to IPv6 in data-center networks.

Question 61. Select the statement that is most true about the relationship between network virtualization and SDNs.
(A) Network virtualization and software-defined networking each enable the other: SDN cannot exist without network virtualization, and network virtualization cannot exist without SDN.
(B) Network virtualization is a potential enabler for software-defined networks, since the separation of data and control planes first requires the creation of a logical network.
(C) Software-defined networking is a potential enabler for virtual networks, since separation of data and control planes makes it easier to manage a logical network topology. -*
(D) Network virtualization is a new concept introduced by Amazon, Nicira, and industry players; it only made sense to talk about network virtualization once central SDN controllers existed.
