87,Which of the following reasons make programming OpenFlow switches difficult? Select all that apply.,"a. An OpenFlow controller only sees events for packets that the switches do not know how to handle.
b. OpenFlow networks require a single, centralized network controller.
c. Networks often have switches from multiple hardware vendors.
d. OpenFlow switches control switches at a low level of abstraction.
e. Network policies involve many independent tasks that may have conflicting behaviors.
",,"a,d,e","a,c,d",,"a. An OpenFlow controller only sees events for packets that the switches do not know how to handle because OpenFlow switches are reactive, meaning they only send packets to the controller when they do not have a matching flow entry in their flow tables. This can make programming them challenging as the controller may not have visibility into all network events. c. Networks often have switches from multiple hardware vendors, which can make programming OpenFlow switches difficult due to differences in hardware capabilities, features, and behavior. d. OpenFlow switches control switches at a low level of abstraction, which can complicate programming as it requires dealing with low-level details of packet processing and forwarding.","['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235286481830172X', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2342356.2342367']",0,12_programming_SDNs,0.9,0.643595922159399,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,"Conceptual issue - open flow switches are not dependent on the implementation and open flow versions are backward compatible.

89,"Suppose that a network operator wants to express a policy that drops all traffic except for traffic from a specific IP prefix (i.e., group of IP addresses).  What problems exist with expressing this policy as a set of OpenFlow rules? Select all that apply.","a. Switches have limited room for flow table entries and cannot store rules for all IP addresses in a prefix by default.
b. The controller may see more than the first packet for a flow that it has already installed.
c. If the controller installs the rules in the wrong order, all traffic might be dropped, instead of allowing the permitted traffic.
d. If the operator starts adding more IP addresses that are permitted to send traffic, performance of the switch might suffer as the number of entries in the switch table grows.
e. Flow table entries can only perform exact matches on IP addresses, so installing rules that operate on groups of IP addresses will take many flow-table entries in the switch.
