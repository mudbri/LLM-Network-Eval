36,What ordering of TCP flags make up the Three-Way Handshake?,"a. SYN, ACK, FIN
b. SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK
c. FIN, FIN/ACK, ACK
d. SYN, ACK, SYN, ACK
",,b,b,,"The correct ordering of TCP flags in the Three-Way Handshake is: SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK. 
- SYN: The initiating device sends a SYN (synchronize) flag to the receiving device to request a connection. 
- SYN/ACK: The receiving device responds with a SYN/ACK (synchronize/acknowledge) flag to acknowledge the request and signal its own readiness to communicate. 
- ACK: Finally, the initiating device sends an ACK (acknowledge) flag back to the receiving device to confirm the connection establishment.",[],1,3_transport_application_layer,0.95,0.999999806387369,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0
