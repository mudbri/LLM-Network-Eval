96,"In PortLand, what are the reasons for assigning hosts pseudo-MAC addresses, as opposed to simply forwarding traffic on physical MAC addresses? Select all that apply.","a. Hosts in the data-center network topology are more vulnerable to attack if they expose their actual physical MAC addresses, rather than having a layer of indirection.
b. It is very difficult to load balance traffic using physical MAC addresses; pseudo MAC addresses make it possible to assign traffic to destination IP addresses.
c. Without pseudo-MAC addresses, switches would have to update forwarding state whenever hosts with a particular MAC address moved from one portion of the topology to another.
d. Forwarding loops are be more common in a flat layer-2 topology than they are in a topology with hierarchical pseudo MAC addresses.
e. In a flat layer-2 topology, switches cannot know on which port to forward traffic without maintaining switch tables for each MAC address, since MAC addresses are flat, not hierarchical.",,"c,e","a,c",,"a. Hosts in the data-center network topology are more vulnerable to attack if they expose their actual physical MAC addresses, rather than having a layer of indirection: Assigning hosts pseudo-MAC addresses adds a layer of security by not exposing the actual physical MAC addresses of the hosts to potential attackers. c. Without pseudo-MAC addresses, switches would have to update forwarding state whenever hosts with a particular MAC address moved from one portion of the topology to another: Pseudo-MAC addresses help in decoupling the host's physical location from its MAC address, allowing easier movement without requiring constant updates in the network's forwarding state.","['https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/PortLand-SIGCOMM10.pdf', 'https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220894607_PortLand_A_Scalable_Fault-Tolerant_Layer_2_Data_Center_Network_Fabric']",0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,0.995960837449901,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,The main concern is not the vulnerability of hosts to attack due to exposure of their actual physical MAC addresses.

b. Routing and forwarding decisions are only based on IP prefix, not on a broader range of traffic flow attributes.
