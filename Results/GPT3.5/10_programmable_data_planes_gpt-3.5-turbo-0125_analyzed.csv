b. Having multiple cores accessing the same queue would require locking to prevent concurrent memory accesses, slowing packet forwarding performance.
c. Having multiple cores accessing the same queue might create the possibility that there is a queue that is not served by any cores.
d. Cores have heterogeneous performance, and packets are different sizes, so it makes sense to assign less powerful cores to queues that have smaller packets.
