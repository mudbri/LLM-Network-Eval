c. Big-MAC
d. Split-MAC
",,d,d,,"Cisco lightweight access points use a split-MAC architecture: time-critical MAC functions (e.g., ACKs, beacons, real‑time frame handling) are performed locally on the AP while higher‑layer and non‑real‑time MAC/control functions are centralized on a wireless controller (LWAPP/CAPWAP model).","['https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5415', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_access_point', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Wireless/Unified_Wireless_Networks/7-0/Unified_Wireless_Architecture.pdf']",1,chapter10_wireless_networks,0.9,1
