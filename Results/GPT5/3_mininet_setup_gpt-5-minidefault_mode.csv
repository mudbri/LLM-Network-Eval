16,Which of the following command is used to generate an OpenFlow network topology consisting of a single switch and 8 hosts with randomly generated MAC addresses for each host?,"a. sudo mn --topo single,8  --switch ovsk --controller remote
b. sudo mn --topo single,3 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
c. sudo mn --topo single,8 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
d. sudo mn --topo linear,8  --switch ovsk --controller remote
",,a,c,,"In Mininet the option --topo single,8 creates a topology with a single switch and 8 hosts, and the --mac flag tells Mininet to assign randomly generated MAC addresses to hosts. The remaining flags (--switch ovsk and --controller remote) select Open vSwitch and a remote controller respectively. Option c exactly matches these requirements.","['https://mininet.org/walkthrough/', 'https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Walkthrough', 'https://github.com/mininet/mininet/blob/master/util/mn.coffee (mn usage/options)']",0,3_mininet_setup,0.99,1
17,What is the purpose of --mac flag used in mininet?,"a. Generates random MAC addresses for the hosts.
b. Generates sequential MAC addresses for the hosts, matching their IP address.
c. Generates sequential MAC addresses for the switch ports, matching their IP address.
d. Generates random MAC addresses for the switch ports.
",,b,b,,"The --mac option tells Mininet to assign deterministic (sequential) MAC addresses to hosts derived from their IPs (e.g., 10.0.0.1 -> 00:00:00:00:00:01). It applies to hosts, not switch ports, and is not for generating random MACs.","['https://github.com/mininet/mininet/blob/master/mn', 'https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Walkthrough', 'http://mininet.org/walkthrough/']",1,3_mininet_setup,0.95,1
20,"What is the purpose of dpctl, provided with mininet?","a. To enable visibility and control over a single switchâ€™s flow table.
b. To enable visibility and control over multiple switch flow table.
c. Is an OpenFlow controller.
",,a,a,,"dpctl is a datapath control utility that talks to an individual OpenFlow datapath/switch to dump, add, or delete flow entries and inspect counters. It operates on a single switch/datapath at a time (you can run it separately for multiple switches, but it does not act as a multi-switch manager), and it is not an OpenFlow controller.","['https://mininet.org/walkthrough/', 'https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Commands', 'https://docs.openvswitch.org/en/latest/refman/ovs-dpctl.8/']",1,3_mininet_setup,0.91,1
