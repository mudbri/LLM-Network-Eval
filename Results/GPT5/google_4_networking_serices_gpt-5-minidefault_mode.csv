46,What transport layer protocol does DNS normally use?,"a. TCP
b. IP
c. UDP
d. ICMP
",,c,c,,"DNS normally uses UDP as its transport-layer protocol (UDP datagrams on port 53) for standard name queries because it is lightweight and low-overhead. TCP is used in special cases (zone transfers, or when responses are too large/truncated and the client falls back to TCP). IP and ICMP are network-layer protocols, not transport-layer protocols used for ordinary DNS queries.","['https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7766', 'https://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers/port-numbers.xhtml (port 53)']",1,google_4_networking_serices,0.95,1
