54,Which of the following properties are characteristics of virtual networks (but not necessarily characteristics of SDN). Select all that apply.,"a. Separates the data and control plane.
b. Refactors network control so that network behavior is controlled from a single logically centralized controller.
c. Separates logical and physical networks.
d. Often deployed in data center networks to allow multiple tenants to share physical network infrastructure.
e. Abstracts the details of the physical network.
",,"c,d,e","c,d,e",,"Virtual networks (network virtualization) create logical networks decoupled from the underlying physical topology: they separate the logical and physical networks (c), abstract the details of the physical network (e), and are commonly used in data centers to support multi-tenancy and sharing of the same physical infrastructure (d). In contrast, separating data and control planes (a) and centralizing control in a single logically centralized controller (b) are hallmarks of SDN architectures and are not required properties of virtual networks.","['https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/network-virtualization.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/what-is-network-virtualization.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_virtualization', 'https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/TR_SDN_ARCH_1.0_2014.pdf', 'https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0440']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.95,1
55,Which of the following are possible ways of creating virtual links in a virtual network? Select all that apply.,"a. A wide-area tunnel, whereby an IP packet is encapsulated in an MPLS tunnel by attaching an MPLS header to the packet.
b. Longest-prefix match forwarding on an IP router.
c. A wide-area tunnel, whereby an Ethernet packet sent between two virtual machines is encapsulated in an IP packet.
d. VLAN switching based on a VLAN tag.
e. Pairs of virtual Ethernet interfaces, where one end of the Ethernet interface pair resides in the virtual environment, and the other resides in the root namespace on the host machine.
",,"a,c,d,e","a,c,d,e",,"a) Yes — MPLS can be used as a wide‑area tunnel (label‑switched path) that encapsulates/labels IP packets to create a virtual link across a provider network. c) Yes — Ethernet‑over‑IP tunnels (e.g., VXLAN, GRE/L2TPv3 carrying L2 frames) encapsulate Ethernet frames in IP, creating L2 virtual links across an IP network. d) Yes — VLAN tagging (802.1Q) implements virtual LANs; switching based on the VLAN tag creates virtual links between ports in the same VLAN. e) Yes — veth (virtual Ethernet) interface pairs (one end in a container/VM namespace, the peer in the host/root namespace) are a common local virtual link technology. b) No — longest‑prefix match is an IP forwarding/routing decision algorithm, not a mechanism that creates a virtual link or overlay; it selects routes over existing links rather than instantiating virtual links itself.","['https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3031', 'https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7348', 'https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/veth.html', 'https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/8021q.html', 'https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1812']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.95,1
56,Which of the following are true of the Mininet network emulator? Select all that apply.,"a. It requires running OpenFlow-capable switches.
b. It is difficult to use it to route traffic for real services.
c. Mininet only allows users to create three types of topologies: linear, tree, and single-switch topologies.

57,"What are the benefits of emulation as opposed to, say, simulation? Select all that apply.","a. An emulation will complete faster than a simulation.
b. An emulator makes it possible to ""port"" experiments from one machine to another.
c. An emulator allows the experimenter run real software on each of the nodes in the emulation.

e. Every run of the emulator will yield exactly the same results, resulting in reproducible experiments.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"Emulation runs real software stacks on virtualized or containerized nodes and mirrors host interfaces, so experiments can be ported between machines and you can run unmodified real software on each emulated node (benefits b and c). Emulation does not inherently complete faster than simulation (a is not generally true), is not necessarily easier to debug than simulation (d is not generally true; real-system complexity can make debugging harder), and does not guarantee bitwise-identical runs each time (e is false because timing, scheduling and external interactions can introduce nondeterminism).","['http://mininet.org/papers/mininet-osdi10-final.pdf', 'http://mininet.org/', 'https://www.nsnam.org/docs/manual/html/emulation.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_emulator']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.92,1

e. ""Shaping"" a link between two nodes to a particular traffic rate.
",,"b,c,d,e","b,c,d,e",,"b: True — Mininet hosts are configurable; you can assign custom IPs when creating hosts or via the CLI (e.g., h1.setIP or h1 ifconfig). c: True — Mininet hosts are real network namespaces and can use DHCP (examples include the mininet/examples/dhcp.py); you can run a DHCP server or dhclient within the emulation to obtain addresses. d: True — Mininet runs real user-space programs in host namespaces, so tools like iperf, wget, ping, etc., can be executed between nodes. e: True — Mininet supports traffic shaping on links (e.g., TCLink or link parameters like bw, delay, loss) using Linux tc to constrain bandwidth/latency. a: Not (generally) true — Mininet is a local network emulator; it cannot directly measure the real-world latency between two geographically separated real hosts (San Francisco vs Los Angeles) unless you actually run Mininet instances on machines located in those cities and connect them over the Internet.

61,Select the statement that is most true about the relationship between network virtualization and SDNs.,"a. Network virtualization is a potential enabler for software-defined networks, since the separation of data and control planes first requires the creation of a logical network.
b. Software-defined networking is a potential enabler for virtual networks, since separation of data and control planes makes it easier to manage a logical network topology.
c. Network virtualization is a new concept introduced by Amazon, Nicira, and industry players; it only made sense to talk about network virtualization once central SDN controllers existed.
d. Network virtualization and software-defined networking each enable the other: SDN cannot exist without network virtualization, and network virtualization cannot exist without SDN.
",,b,b,,"SDN (centralized, programmatic separation of control and data planes) makes it far easier to create and manage logical/virtual networks (overlays, tenant slices, virtual topologies). Thus SDN is a strong enabler for network virtualization. The converse claims (that virtualization must precede SDN or that each cannot exist without the other) are incorrect: network virtualization techniques (VLANs, VPNs, overlays, MPLS) predate or can exist without SDN, and SDN can be used even without full network virtualization.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_virtualization', 'https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SDN_and_OpenFlow.pdf', 'https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/products/nsx/vmware-nsx-network-virtualization.pdf']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.88,1
