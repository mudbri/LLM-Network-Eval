d. MAC addresses
",,c,c,,"An IP address is allocated according to the network (subnet/prefix) a host is attached to — the network portion of the address identifies the network the device is on (addresses may be assigned statically or via DHCP).

b. Classful Identification Routing
c. Class Interconnect Destination Routing
d. Classless Inter-Domain Routing
",,d,d,,"CIDR stands for ""Classless Inter-Domain Routing.""

28,How many octets does a subnet mask have?,"a. 1
b. 3
