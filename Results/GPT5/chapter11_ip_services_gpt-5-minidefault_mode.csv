You are responsible to find out why users are not being able to reach the Internet.","a. The cause is not related to dynamic NAT
b. The command output does not provide any clue to identify the problem
c. Dynamic NAT can't use Standard ACLs
d. The NAT pool does not have enough entries to fulfill the user's requests
",,d,d,,"The show output shows the pool has 10 total addresses and 10 allocated (100%) with 595 misses. That means the dynamic NAT pool is exhausted and additional inside hosts cannot get a translation. Dynamic NAT requires a one-to-one public address for each concurrent inside host (or you must use PAT/overload), so the insufficient pool size is preventing Internet access.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipaddr_nat/configuration/15-mt/ipaddr-nat-15-mt-book/nat-overview.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/network-address-translation-nat/13620-3.html', 'https://networklessons.com/nat/dynamic-nat/']",1,chapter11_ip_services,0.95,1

b. FALSE
",,a,a,,"True. SNMPv3 adds security features including message integrity (ensuring messages are not tampered with), authentication (e.g., HMAC-MD5 or HMAC-SHA), and privacy/confidentiality (encryption).

b. show cdp
c. show running-config
d. show interface brief
",,b,b,,"The 'show cdp' command reports CDP operational status and parameters (it will indicate whether CDP is globally enabled or disabled).

b. SMTP
c. UDP
d. CDP
",,a,a,,"NTP (Network Time Protocol) is specifically designed to synchronize the clocks of devices across a network.
