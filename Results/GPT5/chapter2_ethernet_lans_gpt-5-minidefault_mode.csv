b. show status
c. show interface status
d. show status interface
",,c,c,,"The correct command is show interface status. On Cisco switches this command displays the status of switch ports (status: connected/notconnect/disabled), VLAN, duplex, speed and type. show interface(s) shows detailed per-interface statistics and counters (not the concise status table). show status and show status interface are not valid Cisco IOS commands for viewing interface status.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst/2960/software/release/12-2_52_se/command/reference/crbook/show.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/command/reference/cr_book/cr_show.html']",1,chapter2_ethernet_lans,0.9,1

b. FALSE
",,a,a,,"True. On Cisco IOS, entering ip address dhcp on an interface (for example an SVI on a switch) configures that interface as a DHCP client so it obtains an IPv4 address and subnet mask from a DHCP server; the DHCP reply can also supply the default gateway (DHCP option 3 / default-router).

b. FALSE

28,A Layer 2 switch configuration places all its physical ports into VLAN 2. The IP addressing plan shows that address 175.28.1.150 (with mask 255.255.255.0) is reserved for use by this new LAN switch and that 175.28.1.254 is already configured on the router connected to that same VLAN. The switch needs to support SSH connections into the switch from any subnet in the network. Which of the following commands are part of the required configuration in this case? (Choose two answers.),"a. The switch cannot support SSH because all its ports connect to VLAN 2, and the IP address must be configured on interface VLAN 1.
b. The ip address 175.28.1.150 255.255.255.0 command in interface vlan 2 configuration mode.
c. The ip default-gateway 175.28.1.254 command in global configuration mode.
d. The ip address 172.16.2.250 255.255.255.0 command in interface vlan 1 configuration mode.
e. The ip default-gateway 175.28.1.150 command in global configuration mode.

To allow management traffic (SSH) to reach other subnets, the switch needs a default gateway that points to the router on that VLAN (175.28.1.254) using the global ip default-gateway command (choice c). Other choices are incorrect: the switch can use an SVI for VLAN 2 (not forced to VLAN 1), the 172.16.2.250 address on VLAN 1 is irrelevant, and setting the default gateway to the switch’s own address is wrong.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750/software/release/12-2_25_se/configuration/guide/3750cg/swmgmt.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/security/secure_shell/configuration/15-4mt/sec-ssh-15-4mt-book/secure-ssh.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/lan_vlan/configuration/15-sy/lan-vlan-15-sy-book/lan-vlan-svi.html']",1,chapter2_ethernet_lans,0.95,1
