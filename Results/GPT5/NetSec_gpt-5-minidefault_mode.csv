An attacker can spoof the victim's IP as the query source and use many resolvers or queries to generate reflected, amplified traffic — the classic DNS reflection/amplification attack.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/dns-amplification/', 'https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-088A', 'https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035']",1,NetSec,0.95,1
33,Which type of attack forces a machine to respond to a SYN message by sending a packet to itself on the same port it received the SYN? Select one choice.,"a. Smurf
b. Land attack
c. Amplification attack
d. Reflection attack
",,b,b,,"This behavior describes the LAND (Local Area Network Denial) attack, where an attacker sends a packet (commonly a TCP SYN) with the source IP/port set equal to the destination IP/port so the victim ends up sending a response to itself on the same port, often causing the system to hang or crash. The other choices describe different DoS techniques (Smurf uses ICMP broadcast, amplification/reflection use third-party responders rather than self-directed responses).","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAND_(computer_security)', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/land-attack.html']",1,NetSec,0.95,1
34,A Layer 2 redirect or spoofing attack can be referred to as what type of attack? Select one choice.,"a. ARP attack
b. DHCP attack
c. NetBios attack
d. SSID attack
",,a,a,,"Layer 2 redirect/spoofing refers to ARP spoofing/poisoning, where an attacker sends forged ARP messages on the LAN to associate the attacker’s MAC with another host’s IP, redirecting traffic (often enabling MITM). ARP operates at the data-link/ARP boundary and is the canonical Layer 2 spoofing attack.","['https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc826', 'https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/ARP_spoofing', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/arp-spoofing.html']",1,NetSec,0.95,1
35,Which one of the following options is the illegitimate DHCP server that is referred to in the context of a DHCP server-based attack? Select one choice.,"a. A sitting duck server
b. A rogue DHCP server
c. A target server
d. An erroneous server
",,b,b,,An illegitimate DHCP server that issues unauthorized IP configuration to clients is commonly called a 'rogue DHCP server' (used in DHCP spoofing or server-based attacks to redirect or intercept traffic).,"['https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/identify-rogue-dhcp-server', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/rogue-dhcp.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol']",1,NetSec,0.99,1

b. MAC address security
c. DHCP snooping
d. DHCP authentication""
",,c,c,,"DHCP snooping is a Cisco switch feature that monitors DHCP messages, classifies ports as trusted or untrusted, and blocks DHCP server replies from untrusted ports. It builds a DHCP binding table and prevents rogue DHCP servers and DHCP starvation attacks, making it the appropriate mitigation on a Cisco switch.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipaddr_dhcp/configuration/xe-3s/asr903/dhcp-snooping-xe-3s-book.html', 'https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/DHCP-snooping', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/dynamic-host-configuration-protocol-dhcp/10582-3.html']",1,NetSec,0.95,1
