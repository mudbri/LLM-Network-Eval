62,Which of the following are true of “network slicing”? Select all that apply.,"a. Network operators can use slicing to test configurations on “shadow” networks that mirror a production network topology.
b. One way to slice networks is according to “flow space”, whereby different controllers might control distinct and non-overlapping traffic flows.
c. A controller can prevent one network slice from interfering with the resources of another.
d. Multi-tenant datacenters are one use case for network slicing.
e. Conventional (i.e., non-SDN) networks have no concept of network virtualization or slicing.
",,"a,b,d","a,b,c,d",,"a: True — network slicing creates logical/virtual networks on the same physical infrastructure, which can be used as ‘shadow’ or test slices that mirror production topologies (digital twins/testing). b: True — one common SDN slicing method is flow-space partitioning (e.g., FlowVisor) where different controllers manage distinct, non‑overlapping flow sets. c: True — controllers and virtualization layers can enforce isolation (CPU/bandwidth/topology/flow isolation) so one slice does not interfere with another. d: True — multi-tenant datacenters are a prime use case for network slicing/virtualization to provide isolated tenant networks. e: False — conventional (non‑SDN) networks do have virtualization/slicing concepts (VLANs, VRFs, MPLS VPNs, overlays), so slicing is not unique to SDN though SDN offers new/finer mechanisms.","['https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/tr-archi-sdn-nov2014.pdf', 'http://www.flowvisor.org/papers/flowvisor-hotnets09.pdf', 'https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/wp-content/uploads/Network-Slicing-Paper.pdf', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/vlan/index.html']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.95,1
63,Which of the following are true about flow spaces? Select all that apply.,"a. Two flow spaces cannot overlap.
b. One host could send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces.
c. Flow spaces can only be defined according to combinations of packet header fields.
d. Flowspace isolation separates individual virtual networks from one another but incurs some performance penalty for doing so.
e. Two controllers that write data-plane rules for non-overlapping parts of flowspace can never cause traffic from one “slice” to enter the other slice.
",,b,"b,d",,"b: True — a single host can generate different packets/flows that match different flow-spaces (e.g., different dst IP/port or VLAN), so its traffic can be placed into multiple flow-spaces. d: True — flowspace isolation (as implemented by FlowVisor-style slicing) separates virtual networks by partitioning match-space, but the virtualization layer adds processing and policy checks that introduce some performance overhead. a: False — flow-spaces may overlap; virtualization layers typically allow overlapping flowspace definitions and resolve conflicts (e.g., via priority). c: False — flow-spaces are usually defined over OpenFlow match fields which include packet header fields and other attributes (e.g., ingress port); they are not strictly limited to only “packet header fields.” e: False — the statement is too strong: even with non-overlapping match-sets, controllers can write forwarding or rewrite actions (or install rules that change packet headers/ports) that can cause traffic to move into another slice’s address/match space unless the slicing layer prevents those actions, so non-overlap alone does not guarantee impossibility.","['https://openflow.stanford.edu/display/flowvisorn/Main', 'https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/openflow-switch-v1.0.0.pdf', 'https://web.stanford.edu/~apw/papers/flowvisor-hotnets09.pdf']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,1
64,Which of the following describe the control-plane checks that FlowVisor implements? Select all that apply.,"a. When a packet must be forwarded to a controller, Flowvisor forwards traffic to the correct controller based on which controller “owns” the flowspace corresponding to that packet.
b. Flowvisor prevents each slice's controller from being the target of a denial of service attack from other slices.
c. Flowvisor can only instantiate network slices based on the network topology, not based on other properties, such as application traffic.
d. Flowvisor prevents a controller from writing data-plane rules to a part of flowspace that it does not own.
e. Flowvisor installs traffic shaping and quality of service rules to ensure that each network slice has guaranteed resources.
",,"a,d","a,b,d",,"a: True — FlowVisor mediates Packet-In events and forwards control-plane events to the controller that owns the corresponding flowspace, so packets are delivered to the correct slice controller.
b: True — By filtering and mediating control-plane messages (only forwarding Packet-In for a controller's flowspace and applying policing), FlowVisor prevents slices from causing control-plane events to be delivered to other slices' controllers (reducing the risk of one slice mounting a DoS on another's controller).
c: False — FlowVisor slices are defined by flowspace (match on packet header fields, VLANs, ports, etc.), not limited to topology; slices can be created based on header fields or traffic characteristics, not only topology.
d: True — FlowVisor enforces flowspace isolation by rejecting or rewriting Flow-Mod messages that would install rules outside a controller's allocated flowspace, preventing controllers from writing data-plane rules outside their slice.
e: False — FlowVisor itself does not implement per-slice traffic shaping/QoS guarantees on the data plane (beyond basic policing/isolating control events); bandwidth/QoS provisioning is generally left to lower-layer mechanisms or slice controllers.","['http://www.flowvisor.org/', 'Sherwood, R., et al., ""FlowVisor: A Network Virtualization Layer"" (FlowVisor paper/documentation)', 'Open Networking Foundation & SDN literature on hypervisors and slicing (discussion of FlowVisor control-plane mediation and flowspace isolation)']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.88,1
65,Which of the following are applications in a home network that network slicing could enable? Select all that apply.,"a. Quality of service for certain applications (e.g., video streaming)
b. Traceback of attack traffic to its source
c. Smart grid applications
d. Load balance of inbound traffic
e. Guest WiFi access
",,"a,c,e","a,c,e",,"Selected because network slicing is used to create isolated, policy‑driven logical networks with tailored QoS, security and resource allocations. (a) QoS for video streaming — a slice can guarantee bandwidth, priority and low jitter for streaming traffic. (c) Smart‑grid applications — home IoT/energy devices can be placed on a dedicated slice to provide reliability, low latency and stronger isolation/security. (e) Guest Wi‑Fi access — guest traffic can be isolated into its own slice with separate access policies and resource limits. Not selected: (b) Traceback of attack traffic is a security/forensics capability (logging, monitoring, source attribution) rather than a direct function of network slicing, although slicing can help isolate malicious traffic. (d) Load balancing inbound traffic is a traffic engineering/load‑balancer function; slicing can influence resource assignment or multi‑access use but is not itself the typical mechanism for inbound load balancing in a home network.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/service-provider/what-is-network-slicing.html', 'https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/5g-network-slicing/', 'https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/23_series/23.501/', 'https://www.etsi.org/technologies/nfv']",1,8_data_center_virtualization,0.86,1
69,What are examples of multi-tenant datacenter applications? Select all that apply.,"a. Amazon hosting EC2 instances for customers
b. A home network owner running a private and public WiFi network
c. A retailer running a large, multi-site enterprise network across its global network of sites
d. Google running Gmail and search from a common facility
e. Two enterprises hosting data in a shared facility.
",,"a,d,e","a,e",,Multi-tenant datacenters host resources for multiple independent tenants (different customers or organizations) on shared infrastructure. (a) Amazon EC2 is a classic multi-tenant cloud service hosting instances for many customers on shared datacenter infrastructure. (e) Two enterprises colocating or hosting data in a shared facility is another example of multi-tenant datacenter usage. Choices b and c describe single-owner networks (home or a single retailer’s enterprise) and are not multi-tenant datacenter examples. Choice d describes multiple services run by the same provider for its users (not independent tenant organizations) and therefore is not a typical example of multi-tenant datacenter tenancy between distinct customers.,"['https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/multitenant/technical-overview', 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-instance.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-tenancy']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,1
70,What best describes the relationship between network virtualization and SDN? Select all that apply.,"a. SDN controllers can help manage storage and data facilities, in addition to network configuration
b. SDN predates network virtualization
c. Network virtualization requires SDN
d. SDN makes some aspects of network virtualization easier to manage
e. Network virtualization enables SDN
",,"a,d",d,,"SDN and network virtualization are complementary but neither strictly requires the other. SDN centralizes control (separating control and data planes) and provides programmability that makes provisioning and managing virtual networks (overlays, tenants, policies) easier. Network virtualization can be implemented without SDN (examples: VLANs, VXLAN overlays per RFC 7348), and SDN did not strictly predate all forms of network virtualization, so the other choices are incorrect.","['https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/wp-sdn-newnorm.pdf', 'https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6539', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7348', 'https://www.openflow.org/wp/']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,1
71,Which of the following are true about NVP? Select all that apply.,"a. NVP allows tenants to configure logical datapaths on their own virtual hosts.
b. NVP relies on switches with custom hardware.
c. NVP allows tenants to configure switches in the middle of the network for portions of flowspace that they own.
d. Exact matches for policies in NVP must always be performed in user space on the host.
e. In NVP, most of the “intelligence” for datapath processing lies in virtual hosts, not in switches.
",,"a,e","a,e",,"a) True — Nicira NVP exposes per-tenant logical datapaths (logical switches/routers) implemented at the virtual-host level (the distributed virtual switch on each hypervisor), allowing tenants to configure logical datapaths independent of the physical topology. e) True — NVP’s design places most of the datapath “intelligence” in the virtual hosts (via the distributed virtual switch/OVS and controller-driven flow rules); the physical network is treated as a simple underlay (tunnels/forwarding). b, c, d are false: NVP was built to run on commodity switches (no custom hardware requirement), it virtualizes networks at the hypervisor/overlay level (tenants do not directly configure middle-boxes or slices of physical switches), and exact-match/fast-path forwarding is performed in the datapath (e.g., kernel datapath/OVS) where possible rather than always in user space.","['https://www.openvswitch.org/', 'https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/products/nsx/vmware-nsx-architecture-overview.pdf', 'https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/techpaper/vmware-nicira-technical-overview.pdf']",1,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,1
