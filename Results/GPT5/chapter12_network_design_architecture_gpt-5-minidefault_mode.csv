211,Your company plans to start using public cloud service and now you are considering different WAN options. Your main concern is security by keeping the data private while also providing good QoS services. Which of the following options are under consideration? (Choose two answers.),"a.

c. Using an Internet connection with VPN
d. Using an intercloud exchange
",,"a,d","a,d",,"Private WAN connections (e.g., dedicated circuits, MPLS, or cloud provider direct links such as AWS Direct Connect/Azure ExpressRoute) provide private connectivity plus SLAs that enable predictable performance and QoS.
