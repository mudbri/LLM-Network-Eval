1,Which of the following is an example of a network layer (layer 3) protocol in the five-layer TCP/IP model?,"a. IP
b. Ethernet
c. UDP
d. TCP
",,a,a,,"IP (Internet Protocol) is the network/internet layer (layer 3 in the five-layer TCP/IP model). It provides logical addressing and routing of packets between hosts. Ethernet is a link-layer (layer 2) technology, while TCP and UDP are transport-layer (layer 4) protocols.","['https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc791', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/what-is-the-tcp-ip-model.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite']",1,google_1_basics_computer_networking,0.95,1

b. A browser
c. UDP
d. An ethernet cable
",,b,b,,"A web browser is an application that operates at the application layer of the TCP/IP (five-layer) model, using application protocols like HTTP/HTTPS. A router functions at the network layer (IP), UDP is a transport-layer protocol, and an Ethernet cable is a physical-layer medium.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/application-layer/']",1,google_1_basics_computer_networking,0.98,1

b. The transport layer
c. The physical layer
d. The application layer
",,c,c,,"The physical layer (the lowest layer in the five-layer TCP/IP/Internet model) is responsible for the physical transmission medium — cabling, connectors, voltages, signal encoding and the actual bit-level transmission over wires, fiber or wireless.

b. The transport layer
c. The application layer
d. The network layer
",,d,d,,"Routers operate at the network layer of the TCP/IP model. They forward packets based on network (IP) addresses and use routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, BGP) to determine paths.

b. A collision domain
c. A cable
d. A switch
",,d,d,,"A network switch connects many devices and inspects Ethernet frame contents (Layer 2), e.g., MAC addresses, to make forwarding decisions.

d. A physical layer device that allows connections for many computers at once
",,b,b,,"A router is a network-layer device that forwards packets between independent networks using routing tables and protocols (e.g., IP routing).

b. Aluminum
c. Gold
d. Copper

b. Full duplex allows communications in two directions at the same time; half duplex means that only one side can communicate at a time.
c. Full duplex is a form of simplex communications.
d. Full duplex is slower than half duplex.
",,b,b,,"Full duplex means communication can occur in both directions simultaneously on the link; half duplex means only one direction at a time (transmit or receive). Option a is a common association (hubs are typically half-duplex, switches support full-duplex) but is not the definition and not universally true in all configurations.
