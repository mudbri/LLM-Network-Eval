1,Which of the following terms describe Ethernet addresses that can send one frame and is delivered to multiple devices on the LAN? (Choose two answers.),"a. Broadcast address
b. Multicast address
c. IP address
d. MAC address
e. Unicast address
",,"a,b","a,b",,"Ethernet frames can be delivered to multiple devices using either a broadcast or a multicast MAC address. A broadcast MAC address (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF) is received by all hosts on the LAN (broadcast domain). A multicast MAC address targets a group of receivers that have joined the multicast group (IPv4 multicast maps to specific Ethernet MACs per RFC 1112). Other choices are incorrect: an IP address is a Layer 3 concept (not specifically an Ethernet address), a MAC address is the general term for a Layer 2 address (not specifically the multi-recipient types), and unicast addresses deliver a frame to a single device.","['https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1112', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting_(networking)', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,0.98,1

b. CSMA/CA
c. TCP/IP
d. TCP/UDP
",,a,a,,"CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) is the protocol used by traditional Ethernet to determine how devices react when two stations transmit at the same time and a collision occurs. CSMA/CD senses the carrier, detects collisions, and causes stations to stop, wait a random backoff, and retransmit. CSMA/CA (choice b) is used for collision avoidance (e.g., wireless), while TCP/IP and TCP/UDP (choices c and d) are transport/network-layer protocol suites, not collision-handling rules for a shared data channel.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-sense_multiple_access_with_collision_detection', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/what-is-ethernet.html', 'https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_3-2018.html']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,0.99,1
