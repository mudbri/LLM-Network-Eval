32,What are some of the reasons that it is difficult to deploy improvements to BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. Changes are necessarily incremental because of the large installed base of routers that already run BGP.
b. BGP is implemented in hardware, so deploying changes to BGP requires changes on the timescale of hardware development cycles.
c. Deplyoing changes to BGP requires coordination across potentially tens of thousands of ASes in the Internet.
d. Only a few vendors implement BGP, and deploying changes requires convincing those vendors to change the protocol.
e. Deploying changes requires coordination in standards bodies such as the IETF.
",,"a,c,e","a,c,e",,"a: True — there is a very large installed base of routers and networks running existing BGP configurations and policies, so changes must be incremental to avoid breaking existing operations. c: True — any change to inter-domain routing usually requires operational coordination across many autonomous systems (tens of thousands), which is slow and risky. e: True — BGP protocol evolution and many formal recommendations are developed and standardized through bodies such as the IETF, so standards-process coordination is required. b: False — BGP is a control‑plane routing protocol implemented in router OS/software (though some forwarding-related features interact with hardware), so it is not accurate to say BGP itself is implemented purely in hardware. d: False — many vendors and open‑source router platforms implement BGP (Cisco, Juniper, Arista, Nokia/Alcatel, Huawei, FRRouting, etc.), so the barrier is broader than convincing just “a few” vendors.","['https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4271', 'https://blog.apnic.net/2019/03/25/why-is-bgp-so-hard-to-secure/', 'https://www.ripe.net/participate/ripe-programmes/ripe-ncc-services/rpki', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/iproute_bgp/command/irg-cr-book/irg-intro.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol']",1,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.95,1
33,Which of the following are true about the RCP? Select all that apply.,"a. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, the RCP controller for an AS sees all routes for all destinations that an AS learns from neighboring ASes.
b. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, there is no need for ASes to use BGP to exchange routes.
c. In an RCP deployment, routers no longer have to compute routes.
d. The RCP controller operates just like a route reflector would, selecting a single best route for each destination for all client routers.
e. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, a single AS can benefit from deploying RCP even if no other ASes deploy RCP.
",,"c,e","a,e",,"a) True — In Phase 1 the RCP controller for an AS collects the BGP routes that the AS learns from its neighboring ASes, giving the controller visibility of all candidate routes for each destination within that AS. e) True — Phase 1 is an intra‑AS deployment: a single AS can deploy an RCP and gain benefits (centralized route selection, policy enforcement, improved convergence) even if other ASes have not deployed RCP. b) False — Phase 1 does not eliminate BGP between ASes; BGP is still used to exchange routes with neighboring ASes (RCP centralizes selection inside the AS but external peering still uses BGP). c) False — Routers still perform forwarding and IGP/forwarding-plane functions; RCP centralizes BGP route computation/selection in Phase 1 but does not mean routers do no computation at all (and in other deployments routers may still do selection). d) False — A route reflector merely reflects routes among clients and does not provide the global, policy-aware centralized computation RCP provides; RCP can compute AS‑wide (and even per‑router) route decisions rather than acting simply like a standard route reflector that forwards routes without global centralized policy computation.","['Feamster, N. and Rexford, J., ""RCP: A Control Plane for Routing"" (RCP original paper / SIGCOMM/CCR material) - https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/papers/rcp.pdf', 'RFC 4271 - A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4) - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4271', 'RFC 4456 - BGP Route Reflection - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4456']",0,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.85,1

35,Which of the following is true about the second phase of RCP deployment? Select all that apply.,"a. The second phase of RCP deployment requires no coordination with neighboring ASes.
b. The second phase of RCP deployment offers potential benefits such as reduced routing table size.
c. In the second phase of deployment, the RCP controller sees all routes for every destination that neighboring ASes advertise.
d. The second phase of deployment requires fewer BGP sessions at the RCP controller than the first phase, thus improving scalability of the controller.
e. In the second phase of RCP deployment, ASes do not need to use BGP to exchange routes with one another.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"In the RCP two‑phase deployment model the second phase assumes multiple ASes run cooperating RCP controllers. By exchanging full route information among controllers, an RCP in this phase can see all routes that neighboring ASes advertise (c). That global view enables benefits such as aggregation and installing fewer routes on routers, so reduced routing‑table size is a potential benefit (b). The second phase therefore does require coordination among ASes (so (a) is false), it does not eliminate inter‑AS route exchange or necessarily replace BGP entirely (so (e) is false), and it does not generally reduce the controller’s need to peer with external ASes compared with phase‑1 in the way described (so (d) is not correct).","['https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/papers/rcp.pdf (RCP architecture and deployment discussion, Jennifer Rexford et al.)', 'Kreutz, R., Ramos, F.

37,What are some of the stated goals of simplifying the control plane in the 4D architecture. Select all that apply.,"a. Improved security.
b. Inherent robustness of control plane
c. Simpler management systems
d. Faster innovation
e. Simpler routers and switches
",,"c,d,e","c,d,e",,"The 4D architecture explicitly argues for moving control functionality out of individual routers into centralized Decision/Dissemination planes so that (1) routers and switches can be much simpler (reduced control logic in the data plane) (e), (2) management becomes simpler because global network decisions and configurations are centralized and easier to reason about (c), and (3) innovation is faster since new control policies and algorithms can be developed and deployed centrally without changing every device (d). Improved security and “inherent robustness” are not presented as primary, guaranteed consequences of making the control plane simpler: security can be easier to enforce with central control but is not an automatic stated goal, and robustness requires additional design (redundancy, failover) rather than being inherent (so a and b are not correct selections).","['https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos561/papers/4d.pdf (Clark et al., ""The 4D Approach to Network Control and Management"")', 'Open Networking Foundation, ""SDN Architecture Overview"" / SDN whitepapers describing centralization benefits (faster innovation, simpler devices, easier management) - https://opennetworking.org/']",1,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.8,1
38,What are some examples of how a separate decision plane in the 4D architecture can amortize system overhead? Select all that apply.,"a. Maintaining a single table in memory of AS paths that are learned across all BGP sessions in the AS, and using references into that table for specific routers (and routing decisions), to save memory.
b. If secure BGP were deployed, verifying the signatures on the AS paths of routes received from neighbors.

d. Performing route computation on behalf of all the routers in the AS.
e. Performing inbound traffic engineering on a set of links in a coordinated fashion.
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c,d,e",,"All five choices are examples of costs that a centralized decision plane (as in the 4D architecture) can amortize across the network: a) A single shared AS-path table avoids per-router duplicate storage, reducing memory usage. b) Expensive per-route cryptographic checks (e.g., S‑BGP/BGPsec signature verification) can be done once centrally instead of on every router, amortizing CPU cost. c) Maintaining a global topology view in the decision plane prevents each router from redundantly discovering/keeping full topology state. d) Centralized route computation (running routing algorithms once for the domain) replaces duplicated computation on many routers. e) Coordinated inbound traffic engineering across links is a classic centralized function: the decision plane can compute and apply end-to-end/AS-wide policies that individual routers could not coordinate efficiently on their own.
