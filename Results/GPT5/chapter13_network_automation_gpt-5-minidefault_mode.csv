b. Management plane
c. Control Plane
d. None of the above
",,a,a,,"Forwarding a frame based on its destination MAC address is a data-forwarding operation performed in the switch’s data plane (also called the forwarding plane).

d. Path trace
",,d,d,,"Path Trace. The Path Trace feature in Cisco DNA Center computes and displays the actual packet forwarding path between a source and destination using the network’s current forwarding/route tables and device state.
