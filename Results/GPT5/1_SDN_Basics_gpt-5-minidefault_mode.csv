1,Which of the following are true about Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)? Select all that apply.,"a. The only sizes for an IP address allocation before CIDR were 8, 16, or 24 bits.
b. The prefix length for a CIDR prefix can be anywhere in the range from 0 to 32 bits.
c. In an Internet forwarding table with CIDR, there can only be one unique matching entry for any given IP address.
d. CIDR slowed the rate of Internet routing table growth because prefixes no longer had to be allocated in fixed-size blocks.
",,"b,d","a,b,d",,"a) True — under the original classful addressing scheme network allocations were in fixed class sizes: class A (/8), class B (/16), class C (/24). b) True — IPv4 CIDR prefix lengths are specified as an integer number of bits from 0 through 32. d) True — CIDR enabled prefix aggregation (supernetting) so address space and routing advertisements could be aggregated, which reduced the growth rate of Internet routing tables compared with classful fixed-size allocations. c) False — multiple CIDR prefixes can match a given destination address; routers use longest-prefix (most specific) match to select a single forwarding entry, so there may be many matches but only one chosen entry.","['https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1519.txt', 'https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4632.txt', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/what-is-cidr.html']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
2,Which of the following are true about how DNS lookups work? Select all that apply.,"a. A DNS A-record query for google.com will only return a single IP address at a time.
b. An NS-record query for a DNS lookup will return the name(s) of the authoritative name server(s) for that domain.
c. If your local DNS resolver caches an NS record for google.com for multiple days, all clients who use that DNS resolver will continue using the same IP address to reach Google’s Web server until that NS record expires.
d. An MX-record query for a DNS lookup will return the IP address of the mail server for that domain.
e. All DNS PTR records are maintained by a single organization in-addr.arpa.
",,b,b,,"b is correct: an NS record response lists the hostname(s) of the authoritative name server(s) for a domain. All other choices are incorrect: (a) A queries can return multiple A records (multiple IPs) for the same name; (c) caching an NS record does not force clients to use the same IP for a webserver — A/AAAA records (and their TTLs), load‑balancing, and other mechanisms determine which IPs are used; (d) MX records return mail exchanger hostnames (and preference values), not IP addresses — an additional A/AAAA lookup is required to resolve the IP; (e) PTR (reverse DNS) records are delegated across RIRs/ISPs/organizations under in-addr.arpa (and ip6.arpa), not maintained by a single organization.","['https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1034', 'https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1035', 'https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2181', 'https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5321', 'https://www.iana.org/domains/in-addr.arpa', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
3,Which of the following are true about traffic control with BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
b. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
c. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
d. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
",,"a,b","a,b",,"a is true: BGP local-preference is an intra‑AS attribute used by routers inside an AS to select the preferred exit path for a destination, so it controls outbound traffic selection from your AS. b is true: AS‑path prepending makes the advertised AS path appear longer to external peers, which is used to influence how other ASes choose routes toward your prefixes (i.e., inbound traffic to your AS). c and d are false: AS‑path prepending does not control outbound traffic from your AS (that is decided locally), and local‑preference does not affect how remote ASes send traffic to you (inbound).","['https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4271', 'https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/concept/bgp-attributes-local-preference.html', 'https://labs.ripe.net/author/bum/what-is-as-path-prepending/', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/iproute_bgp/configuration/15-mt/ipr-15-mt-book/bgp-selection.html']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
4,Which of the following are true about layering? Select all that apply.,"a. The network layer guarantees reliable, in-order delivery of packets.
b. The network layer has only a single protocol in widespread use today, representing what we call the “narrow waist”.
c. The transport layer uses port numbers.
d. The destination address in the link layer header is always the address of the next layer-3 node along an end-to-end IP path.
",,"b,c","b,c,d",,"b: True — the Internet’s network-layer protocol family (IP) serves as the “narrow waist” (one common network-layer service/interface used by many link/transport protocols). c: True — end-to-end transport protocols such as TCP and UDP use port numbers to demultiplex endpoints on a host. d: Generally true — the link-layer destination address on a given hop is the link-layer address of the next-hop layer‑3 node (either the next-hop router or the final host if on the same link). (Note: there are practical exceptions such as broadcast/multicast link-layer addresses and some tunneling/encapsulation cases.) a: False — the network layer (IP) does not guarantee reliable, in-order delivery; that is provided by transport-layer protocols like TCP when needed.","['https://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/WEB/NETWORKING3E.html (Kurose & Ross, Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach)', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc791 (Internet Protocol)', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793 (TCP)', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc768 (UDP)', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc826 (ARP)', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model#Layered_architecture']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.85,1
5,Which of the following are not true about packet switching? Select all that apply.,"a. Once a connection is established between two endpoints in a packet switched network, the end-to-end route cannot change, or the connection must be re-established.
b. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will always experience predictable latency.
c. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will never be dropped by intermediate nodes along the path.
d. A user of a packet switched network might occasionally get a “busy signal” if there are too many users on the network.
",,"a,b,c,d","a,b,c,d",,"All four statements are incorrect for packet-switched networks. (a) False — in packet switching (datagram mode) packets may take different routes and the end-to-end path can change without re‑establishing a connection; only some virtual‑circuit packet systems fix a path. (b) False — latency is variable (queuing, congestion, route changes) and not inherently predictable. (c) False — intermediate nodes may drop packets due to congestion, errors, or policy (packet switching is typically best‑effort). (d) False — a traditional “busy signal” is characteristic of circuit switching; packet networks instead exhibit increased delay and/or packet loss under overload rather than a busy tone to the user.","['https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc791', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching', 'http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
6,Which of the following are true about content distribution networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Content distribution networks can improve the performance that a client sees by reducing the network latency between the client and the content that it is downloading.
b. Content distribution networks can reduce transit expenses for a content provider by enabling much of the provider’s content to be served from a nearby network, sometimes even from a cache that is within the client’s own network.
c. Real-time content such as video streams cannot be distributed from a content distribution network.
d. Content distribution networks typically redirect Web clients to a nearby Web cache by rewriting the IP address of packets sent from the client to the IP address of the nearby Web cache.
",,"a,b","a,b",,"a: True — CDNs place cached copies of content on edge servers close to users, reducing network latency and improving client-perceived performance.
b: True — By serving content from nearby caches (including caches inside an ISP or partner network), CDNs offload traffic from the origin and reduce transit/backhaul costs for the content provider.
c: False — CDNs commonly distribute real-time and live video streams (adaptive bitrate and live streaming are standard CDN use cases).
d: False — CDNs typically steer clients to an appropriate edge server using DNS responses, HTTP redirects, or anycast routing rather than by rewriting the source/destination IPs in packets from the client; packet-level IP rewriting is not the typical mechanism for CDN redirection.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/video-streaming/', 'https://www.akamai.com/us/en/resources/what-is-a-cdn.jsp', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
7,Which of the following are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control? Select all that apply.,"a. Only wireless networks can have collisions at the receiver; such collisions are not possible on wired Ethernet networks.
b. Using RTS/CTS (“request to send”, “clear to send”) control reduces the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network.
c. A wireless sender can avoid causing a collision at the receiver by performing a “carrier sense” to determine whether any other sender wants to transmit at the time that it wishes to send a packet.
d. Disabling RTS/CTS necessarily lowers the effective throughput of the wireless network, since more collisions will occur at the receiver without RTS/CTS enabled.
",,b,a,,"None of the given statements are universally true.

a) False. Collisions can occur on wired shared-media Ethernet (CSMA/CD) and at the receiver when two transmitters put signals on the same medium; modern switched/full-duplex Ethernet avoids collisions by design, but that does not make collisions impossible on wired Ethernet in general.

b) False as an absolute. RTS/CTS adds control-frame overhead and can reduce raw channel efficiency for small frames or when there are no hidden nodes, but it can increase effective throughput in environments with hidden nodes or frequent collisions by preventing long-frame collisions. So RTS/CTS does not universally reduce overall achievable throughput.

c) False. Carrier sense (physical/virtual) prevents transmissions when a sender senses ongoing transmissions it can hear, but it cannot detect transmitters that are out of range of the sender yet in range of the receiver (hidden node problem). Thus carrier sense alone cannot always avoid causing a collision at the receiver.

d) False. Disabling RTS/CTS does not necessarily lower effective throughput — disabling it removes overhead and can increase throughput when hidden nodes are not a problem; in other scenarios it may reduce throughput due to more collisions. Therefore the effect is situational, not necessary.

8,Which of the following are true about video streaming? Select all that apply.,"a. Using UDP to stream a video instead of TCP is appropriate if the client is more concerned about low delay and interactivity than it does about receiving a high-quality stream.
b. A larger playout buffer at the client allows the client more time to recover from lost packets.
c. Using TCP for video streaming could result in larger delays between transmission and playout than streaming the same video with UDP.
d. Since UDP provides no reliable delivery guarantees, a video streaming application that uses UDP as its transport cannot recover from any packet loss in the video stream.
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"a) True — UDP avoids in‑stack retransmission and head‑of‑line blocking so it’s often chosen for low‑latency, interactive streaming where occasional loss is preferred to extra delay. b) True — a larger playout (jitter) buffer gives the client more time to smooth jitter and to recover (via late retransmit, FEC, or concealment) before playout. c) True — TCP’s reliability, retransmissions and head‑of‑line blocking (and congestion control) can introduce extra delay between transmission and playout compared with UDP‑based streaming. d) False — UDP itself is unreliable, but applications can and do implement recovery (FEC, application‑level retransmit, error concealment) on top of UDP, so loss can be mitigated.

9,Which of the following are true about TCP? Select all that apply.,"a. TCP guarantees that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted.
b. A TCP sender and receiver use a “three-way handshake” both to set up and to terminate the TCP connection.
c. TCP’s congestion avoidance algorithm causes the sender to reduce its sending rate by a factor of two when it sees a packet loss.
d. A TCP sender controls its sending rate by adjusting the number of unacknowledged packets that can be sent over the network at any time.
",,"a,c,d","a,c,d",,"a: True — TCP provides a reliable, in-order byte-stream service so the receiver sees the bytes in the order sent. b: False — connection setup uses a three-way (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) handshake; termination normally uses a four-segment exchange (FIN/ACK pairs), not the three-way handshake. c: True (with nuance) — classic TCP congestion control uses multiplicative decrease on loss (TCP Reno sets ssthresh ≈ cwnd/2 and reduces the congestion window, i.e., roughly halves the sending rate on detected loss). Note: some variants or timeout events behave differently (e.g., Tahoe/timeouts reduce more aggressively; modern algorithms like CUBIC have different heuristics). d: True — TCP controls sending rate via the congestion window and related limits which bound the number of unacknowledged bytes/packets allowed in the network at once.","['https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5681', 'https://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,1
10,Which of the following are true about denial of service attacks (and defenses)? Select all that apply.,"a. If every network on the Internet performed stateless ingress filtering to defend against source IP spoofing, the DNS reflection attack would not work.
b. If every network on the Internet performed stateless egress filtering to defend against source IP address spoofing, the DNS reflection attack could not be carried out.
c. In a “SYN Flood” attack, each TCP SYN packet that a victim receives causes it to set up TCP connection state.
d. A “DNS Reflection” attack requires the attacking client to “spoof” the source IP address of the packet containing the DNS request.
",,"b,c,d","b,c,d",,"b: True — blocking spoofed source addresses at the network edge (egress filtering / BCP38-style checks on packets leaving a network) prevents an attacker from sending packets that claim to originate at some other victim, so reflection/amplification attacks cannot be launched from that attacker’s network. c: True — a SYN-flood works because each received TCP SYN normally causes the server to allocate (half-open) connection state while waiting for the final ACK, exhausting resources unless mitigations (SYN cookies, timeouts) are used. d: True — DNS reflection/amplification relies on sending DNS queries with the victim’s IP as the source so that large DNS responses are delivered to the victim; the attacker therefore must spoof the source IP. a: False — simple/stateless “ingress” filtering at arbitrary network boundaries does not by itself guarantee that all spoofed packets will be dropped; the practical, widely recommended mitigation is to filter packets on egress at the source (or apply proper reverse-path checks at edges). In short, preventing spoofing at the network edge where the packets originate (egress/appropriate ingress uRPF) is what stops DNS reflection attacks.","['https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2827', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4987', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/dns-amplification/', 'https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-017A']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.8,1
