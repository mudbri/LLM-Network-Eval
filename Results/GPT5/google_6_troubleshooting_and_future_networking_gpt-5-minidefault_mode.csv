90,The protocol used to communicate network errors is known as __________.,"a. ICMP
b. Traceroute
c. TCP
d. UDP
",,a,a,,"ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is the network-layer protocol used to send error and control messages (e.g., Destination Unreachable, Time Exceeded, Echo Request/Reply). Traceroute is a diagnostic tool that uses ICMP or UDP/TTL behavior; TCP and UDP are transport-layer protocols, not specifically for network error messages.","['https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc792', 'https://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol']",1,google_6_troubleshooting_and_future_networking,0.99,1
91,The ping utility sends what message type?,"a. Echo Request
b. Echo Reply
c. Destination Network Unknown
d. Destination Network Unreachable
",,a,a,,"The ping utility transmits ICMP Echo Request messages (ICMP Type 8) to the target host; the target responds with ICMP Echo Reply (Type 0). Options c and d are ICMP error messages, not what ping sends to probe reachability.","['https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc792', 'https://www.iana.org/assignments/icmp-parameters/icmp-parameters.xhtml', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)']",1,google_6_troubleshooting_and_future_networking,0.98,1

d. Tracert
",,c,c,,"Use the PowerShell cmdlet Test-NetConnection with the -Port parameter to verify TCP connectivity to a specific port on a Windows system (e.g., Test-NetConnection -ComputerName host -Port 80). Ping and tracert use ICMP and path tracing respectively and do not test a TCP/UDP port.

b. Division
c. Subtraction
d. Addition
",,c,c,,"Routers decrement (subtract from) the TTL value—typically by 1—on each hop. If TTL reaches zero the router discards the packet and returns an ICMP Time Exceeded message, which is how traceroute discovers intermediate hops.","['https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc791.txt', 'https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1812.txt', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceroute']",1,google_6_troubleshooting_and_future_networking,0.99,1
