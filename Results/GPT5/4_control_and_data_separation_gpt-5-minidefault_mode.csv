25,What could be the operational steps behind the AT&T's IRSCP (a commercial version of the Routing Control Platform) for detecting malicious traffic? Select all that apply.,"a. The controller sees all traffic passing through the network, detects an attack, and installs a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where the attack traffic is originating.
b. The end host changes its IP address so that it is no longer the target of the attack traffic.
c. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to re-route traffic through a deep-packet inspection device.
d. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to install a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where attack traffic is originating.
e. A victim end host sends an alert to an on-path firewall about the source and nature of an attack, at which point the firewall installs a null route to drop the traffic at the entry point where the attack is originating.
",,"c,d","c,d",,AT&T’s commercial RCP/IRSCP-style deployments separate detection/measurement from routing actions. A measurement system (or monitoring probes) detects malicious traffic and identifies ingress points; the controller is then instructed to either steer traffic through a scrubbing/deep‑packet‑inspection device (c) or to install a null/black‑hole route at the ingress to drop the attack traffic (d). Option (a) is incorrect because the controller typically does not itself ‘‘see all traffic’’ end‑to‑end; it acts on signals from measurement systems. Option (b) (victim changing its address) is not a typical operational step of RCP/IRSCP. Option (e) is not representative: victim hosts don’t generally signal an on‑path firewall to push remote null routes at upstream entry points — that action is normally taken by the ISP/controller after measurement/analysis.,"['https://www.netscout.com/solutions/ddos-mitigation', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise/design-zone-security/remote-triggered-black-hole.html', 'https://www.caida.org/projects/ddos-attack/', 'https://www.research.att.com/projects/rcp/']",1,4_control_and_data_separation,0.9,1

27,What are some of the motivations for using Layer-2 forwarding in a data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Ability to use existing routing protocols to establish paths between hosts.
b. Easier configuration/administration, since there is no need to number hosts or configure subnets.
c. Better security properties.
d. Better scaling properties.
e. Better load balancing properties.
",,b,"b,e",,"b: True — Layer‑2 forwarding keeps hosts in the same broadcast/subnet, so moving VMs or hosts across the fabric does not require renumbering or reconfiguring IP subnets (simplifies configuration and administration).
e: True — While classic flat L2 has limits, modern L2 fabric technologies (e.g., TRILL, SPB, VXLAN+EVPN) provide multipath forwarding at L2 and enable better utilization of multiple links for load balancing across the data‑center fabric. 
Incorrect options: a is incorrect because using routing protocols to establish paths is an L3 behavior (routing), not a reason to choose L2. c is incorrect because L2 generally exposes larger broadcast domains and is more susceptible to ARP/spoofing issues unless additional controls are applied. d is incorrect because pure L2 flat designs typically scale worse (broadcast domains, large MAC tables) than properly designed L3 hierarchical fabrics.","['https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1004082', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6325', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7432', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/data-center-virtualization/data-center-fabric.html']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.85,1

b. The control plane allows traffic to be forwarded using Layer 2 addresses, thus allowing automatic load balance across the topology.
c. The separation allows fewer switches to be used in the data center topology, thus lowering costs.
d. All routes can be controlled and monitored from a central point of control.
e. A network controller can permit the renumbering of end hosts to have topology-dependent Layer 2 MAC addresses.

e. Having multiple controllers install forwarding table entries on the same router and resolving the conflict on the router itself.
",,"a,b,c,d","a,b,d",,"a) Running a consistency protocol (e.g., Paxos/Raft or state-machine replication) is a standard way to keep controller replicas consistent. b) A primary/backup (hot-spare) design where a backup maintains a complete, up-to-date view and takes over on failure is a common practical approach to tolerate replica inconsistency/failures. d) Partitioning the network so different controllers manage independent parts reduces the need for cross-replica synchronization (sharding the control state). Option c is about memory usage, not inconsistency mitigation. Option e (letting multiple controllers write the same switch and resolve conflicts on the switch) is not a typical/reliable approach to handle controller-state inconsistency and is generally undesirable because it shifts complex conflict resolution to data-plane devices and can produce incorrect behavior.","['https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0440 (Kreutz et al., ""Software-Defined Networking: A Comprehensive Survey"")', 'https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/onix-large-scale-network-control-platform/ (Onix platform paper)', 'https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf (Diego Ongaro & John Ousterhout, Raft consensus algorithm)', 'https://onosproject.org/ (ONOS — distributed controller architecture and availability design)', 'https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/openflow-spec-v1.3.0.pdf (OpenFlow switch specification — controller roles and flow rule semantics)']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.9,1

",,"a,b,c,e","a,b,c,e",,"a) Caching forwarding decisions in the data plane (e.g., flow table entries, wildcard/proactive rules, local fast-paths) reduces the number of control-plane interactions and controller load. b) Limiting the set of operations the controller must handle (offloading routine/local decisions to the data plane or handling only exceptions) reduces control-plane traffic and processing. c) Eliminating redundant state/data structures (reducing duplicated state, compacting representations, avoiding unnecessary replication) lowers memory, synchronization, and update costs and helps scale. d) is incorrect — routing all traffic through the controller is the opposite of a scalability solution (it creates a bottleneck). e) Running multiple controllers (distributed or hierarchical control-plane designs) partitions management and spreads load, improving scalability and fault tolerance.","['https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sdn-definition.pdf (Open Networking Foundation SDN definition)', 'Kreutz, D., Ramos, F.M.V., Verissimo, P.E., et al., ""Software-Defined Networking: A Comprehensive Survey,"" Proc.

Each controller has a complete view of the portion of the network that it is controlling, and therefore can guarantee consistent routing within that partition.
b. The controller cannot see many of the routers in the network anyway, so there is no way for it to install incorrect routing state in the routers that it is not connected to.
c. The controllers are partitioned from the network routers, and the routers will fall back to running a distributed routing protocol.
d. Running the network from a single high-level control plane guarantees that network partitions and loops never occur in the first place.
",,a,a,,"Option (a) is correct. RCP replicas are designed so each controller maintains a complete, authoritative view of the part of the network it controls; therefore when the data plane is partitioned a replica that still has reachability to the routers in its partition can continue to compute and install correct, consistent forwarding state for that partition. The other choices are incorrect: (b) is a mistaken justification, (c) describes a fallback to distributed routing (not the RCP guarantee), and (d) is false—a single control plane does not magically prevent partitions or loops.","['https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/papers/rcp-sigcomm04.pdf', 'https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0440 (Kreutz et al., ""Software-Defined Networking: A Comprehensive Survey"")', 'https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sdn-resources.pdf (Open Networking Foundation, SDN materials)']",1,4_control_and_data_separation,0.9,1
