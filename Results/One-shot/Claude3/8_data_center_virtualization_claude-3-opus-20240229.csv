62,Which of the following are true of “network slicing”? Select all that apply.,"a. Network operators can use slicing to test configurations on “shadow” networks that mirror a production network topology.
b. One way to slice networks is according to “flow space”, whereby different controllers might control distinct and non-overlapping traffic flows.
c. A controller can prevent one network slice from interfering with the resources of another.
d. Multi-tenant datacenters are one use case for network slicing.
e. Conventional (i.e., non-SDN) networks have no concept of network virtualization or slicing.
",,"a,b,d","a,b,c,d",,"a. This is a valid use case for network slicing. Operators can test configurations on slices that mirror production.b. Slicing by flow space is a common approach where each slice handles a distinct set of traffic flows.c. Isolation between slices is a key property. The controller can enforce resource isolation between slices.d. Multi-tenant datacenters are a common use case where tenants can be given their own isolated network slices.e. This is incorrect. Conventional networks do have forms of network virtualization and slicing, such as VLANs. However, SDN enables more flexible and dynamic slicing.Therefore, the correct answers are options a, b, c, and d, which are all true statements about network slicing in SDN.","['https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/virtualization/definitions/what-is-network-slicing/', 'https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/10/20/2567/htm', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7243304']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.95,1
63,Which of the following are true about flow spaces? Select all that apply.,"a. Two flow spaces cannot overlap.
b. One host could send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces.
c. Flow spaces can only be defined according to combinations of packet header fields.
d. Flowspace isolation separates individual virtual networks from one another but incurs some performance penalty for doing so.
e. Two controllers that write data-plane rules for non-overlapping parts of flowspace can never cause traffic from one “slice” to enter the other slice.
",,b,"b,d",,"a. This is false. Flow spaces can overlap, and in fact, overlapping flow spaces are a common source of bugs in SDN applications.b. This is true. A host could send traffic with different header fields that match the definitions of two different flow spaces.c. This is false. Flow spaces can be defined according to other properties beyond just packet headers, such as the input port on a switch.d. This is true. Flowspace isolation does separate virtual networks but comes with some performance overhead to enforce the separation.e. This is false. Even with non-overlapping flow spaces, bugs in the controller applications could still cause traffic to 'leak' between isolated slices if the control software is not implemented correctly.Therefore, the correct answers are options b and d.","['https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/hotice12/hotice12-final33.pdf', 'https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos597E/papers/sdnsurvey.pdf']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,1
64,Which of the following describe the control-plane checks that FlowVisor implements? Select all that apply.,"a. When a packet must be forwarded to a controller, Flowvisor forwards traffic to the correct controller based on which controller “owns” the flowspace corresponding to that packet.
b. Flowvisor prevents each slice's controller from being the target of a denial of service attack from other slices.
c. Flowvisor can only instantiate network slices based on the network topology, not based on other properties, such as application traffic.
d. Flowvisor prevents a controller from writing data-plane rules to a part of flowspace that it does not own.
e. Flowvisor installs traffic shaping and quality of service rules to ensure that each network slice has guaranteed resources.
",,"a,d","a,d",,"a. This is correct. FlowVisor forwards packets to the appropriate controller based on the flowspace definition for each slice.b. While important, this is not a control-plane check that FlowVisor itself implements. c. This is incorrect. FlowVisor can slice the network based on any combination of packet header fields, not just topology.d. This is correct. FlowVisor ensures that a controller can only write rules that apply to its own slice's flowspace.e. This is incorrect. FlowVisor itself does not install QoS rules, though it enables slices to implement their own such rules.Therefore, the correct answers are options a and d, which describe the key control-plane checks performed by FlowVisor.",['https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/osdi10/tech/full_papers/Sherwood.pdf'],1,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,1
65,Which of the following are applications in a home network that network slicing could enable? Select all that apply.,"a. Quality of service for certain applications (e.g., video streaming)
b. Traceback of attack traffic to its source
c. Smart grid applications
d. Load balance of inbound traffic
e. Guest WiFi access
",,"a,c,e","a,c,e",,"a. Network slicing can enable quality of service for specific applications like video streaming by dedicating resources to that slice.b. Traceback of attack traffic is a security function, not directly enabled by network slicing. c. Network slicing can dedicate resources to smart grid applications to ensure their performance.d. Load balancing of inbound traffic is a general networking function, not specific to network slicing.e. Network slicing can enable guest WiFi access by isolating guest traffic in its own slice, separate from the main home network.Therefore, the applications that network slicing could enable in a home network are quality of service for certain applications, smart grid applications, and guest WiFi access.","['https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/white-papers/network-slicing-for-5g-networks', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8466371']",1,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,1
69,What are examples of multi-tenant datacenter applications? Select all that apply.,"a. Amazon hosting EC2 instances for customers
b. A home network owner running a private and public WiFi network
c. A retailer running a large, multi-site enterprise network across its global network of sites
d. Google running Gmail and search from a common facility
e. Two enterprises hosting data in a shared facility.
",,"a,d,e","a,d,e",,"a. Amazon EC2 is a multi-tenant service where multiple customers run virtual machines on shared infrastructure managed by Amazon. This is a classic example of a multi-tenant datacenter application.b. A home network with private and public WiFi is not a multi-tenant datacenter application. It's a small-scale network with some segmentation but not true multi-tenancy. c. A retailer's global enterprise network, while large, is still a single-tenant network. The sites all belong to one organization.d. Google's Gmail and search are multi-tenant applications running on shared infrastructure in Google's datacenters, serving millions of distinct end users. e.

70,What best describes the relationship between network virtualization and SDN? Select all that apply.,"a. SDN controllers can help manage storage and data facilities, in addition to network configuration
b. SDN predates network virtualization
c. Network virtualization requires SDN
d. SDN makes some aspects of network virtualization easier to manage
e. Network virtualization enables SDN
",,"a,d",d,,"SDN and network virtualization are related but distinct concepts. SDN is an approach that separates the network control plane from the data plane, allowing the control plane to be directly programmable. Network virtualization refers to the abstraction of network resources, allowing a physical network to be divided into multiple virtual networks.While network virtualization does not require SDN (c), and existed before SDN was developed (b), SDN can make certain aspects of managing a virtualized network easier (d). For example, an SDN controller can help automate the provisioning and configuration of virtual networks.However, SDN is not a strict requirement for network virtualization (e), and the scope of SDN is generally focused on network configuration rather than managing storage and data facilities (a).","['https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/software-defined-networking.html', 'https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/network-virtualization.html']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,1
