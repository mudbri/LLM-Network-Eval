c. Class Interconnect Destination Routing
d. Classless Inter-Domain Routing
",,d,d,,CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing. It is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing Internet Protocol packets. CIDR replaced the previous classful network addressing architecture in an effort to slow the growth of routing tables on routers across the Internet and to help slow the rapid exhaustion of IPv4 addresses.,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-cidr/']",1,google_2_networking_layer,1,1

d. 192.168.1.0\24
",,c,c,,"CIDR notation is written as an IP address, followed by a slash, then the number of network prefix bits.

28,How many octets does a subnet mask have?,"a. 1
b. 3
c. 4
d. 2
",,c,c,,"A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that masks an IP address, and divides the IP address into network address and host address. 32 bits are divided into four octets (1 octet = 8 bits).
