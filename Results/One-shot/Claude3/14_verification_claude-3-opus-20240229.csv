106,Which of the following are true about configuration verification? Select all that apply.,"a. Configuration verification can only detect errors after the configuration is installed on production routers.
b. Configuration verification cannot detect incorrect protocol behavior that may result from faulty hardware.
c. Verifying the correctness of network behavior based on configuration requires a model of protocol behavior.
d. Configuration verification requires a large-scale simulation of network protocols, complete with tests for different message orderings and timings.
e. Configuration verification cannot detect incorrect protocol behavior that may result from buggy software.
",,"b,c,e",c,,"a. This is false. Configuration verification can detect errors before the configuration is installed on production routers by analyzing the configuration files.b. This is true. Configuration verification focuses on analyzing the intended behavior based on configuration, not on detecting hardware faults. c. This is true. To verify that the network will behave correctly based on the configuration, the verification system needs a model of how the configured protocols are supposed to behave.d. This is false. Configuration verification does not require large-scale protocol simulation. It can be done by analyzing configuration files against a model of intended behavior.e. This is true. Like with hardware faults, configuration verification is not focused on detecting bugs in router software. It assumes the protocols behave as intended based on the configuration.Therefore, only statement c is true about configuration verification.","['https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi11/automated-network-configuration-analysis', 'https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6114/2021fa/schedule/slides/18-netverify.pdf']",0,14_verification,0.95,1
107,"Which of the following assertions could be verified with configuration verification (i.e., of a snapshot of router and switch configuration)? Select all that apply.","a. A route learned from one peer will not be readvertised to another peer.
b. The current settings of link weights will result in all routers being connected.
c. The configuration of route reflectors and clients ensures that any route learned from a neighboring AS will propagate to all routers in the topology.
d. There is no traffic pattern that would ever result in a stateful firewall dropping traffic.
e. Any time that an infection occurs, hosts are automatically quarantined.
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"Configuration verification involves analyzing a snapshot of network device configurations to verify certain properties or invariants. Based on this:a. This property about route advertisement between peers can be checked based on the BGP configuration on the relevant routers.b. Connectivity of the topology based on the current link weight settings can be verified by analyzing the OSPF or IS-IS configuration on the routers. c. Propagation of externally learned routes to all internal routers based on the route reflector configuration is a property that configuration verification can check.d. Verifying that a firewall will never drop traffic under any circumstances requires checking all possible traffic patterns, which is not feasible with a configuration snapshot alone. Dynamic analysis of actual traffic would be needed.e. Automatically quarantining infected hosts likely requires dynamic behavior based on real-time monitoring, not just static configuration. The configuration may specify the quarantine policy but cannot itself determine if an infection has occurred.Therefore, only assertions a, b and c can be verified using configuration verification of a network snapshot.","['https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6114/2021fa/schedule/slides/15-verification.pdf', 'https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi13/technical-sessions/presentation/khurshid']",1,14_verification,0.9,1
108,Which of the following are true about data-plane verification? Select all that apply.,"a. Data-plane verification techniques such as header-space analysis typically operate on a single ""snapshot"" of data-plane state.
b. Data plane verification can only operate on the forwarding table of a single router or switch; network-wide analysis is not possible.
c. Data-plane verification may detect errors that configuration analysis can miss in the cases of buggy control-plane software.
d. Data-plane verification requires accurate modeling of network protocols, including which bits are present in which part of the packet header.
e. Header-space analysis can only provide verification/analysis for specific packets; it cannot answer questions for general parts of flowspace.
",,"a,c","a,c,d",,"a. Data-plane verification techniques like header space analysis do typically operate on a single snapshot of the data plane state at a time.b. This is incorrect. Data plane verification can analyze the network-wide data plane state, not just a single device. c. Data plane verification can catch bugs that occur in the control plane software implementation even if the configuration is correct.d. To reason about packet trajectories, data plane verification needs an accurate model of the protocols and header fields.e. Header space analysis can reason about general parts of the flow space, not just specific packets.Therefore, statements a, c and d are correct about data plane verification.","['https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi13/technical-sessions/presentation/kazemian', 'https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/papers/frenetic-icfp.pdf']",0,14_verification,0.95,1
109,Which of the following assertions could be verified with data plane verification? Select all that apply.,"a. The network will remain connected, given the failure of at most two links.
b. Two virtual network ""slices"" are not completely isolated: it is possible for traffic to travel from one slice to the other.
c. The configuration of the network's routing protocols will result in persistent oscillation (i.e., they will never settle on a stable set of routes).
d. The forwarding table state in the routers across the network will result in a forwarding loop.
e. The rules installed on the firewalls in the network ensure that only port 80 traffic can ever reach the web server from the rest of the Internet.
",,"b,d,e","b,d,e",,"Data plane verification involves checking properties of the network's forwarding behavior, given a concrete configuration.a. Checking connectivity under failures requires reasoning about many possible configurations, not a single one, so this is a control plane property.b. Isolation between virtual networks is a data plane property that can be checked given the forwarding rules.c. Protocol oscillation is a control plane property having to do with the computation of routes.d. Forwarding loops are a data plane property that can be checked given the forwarding tables.e. Reachability subject to firewall rules is a data plane property.Therefore, the assertions that could be verified with data plane verification are b, d, and e.","['https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6114/2021fa/schedule/slides/16-netverif.pdf', 'https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi19-panda.pdf']",1,14_verification,0.95,1
110,Which of the following is true about Kinetic policies? Select all that apply.,"a. State transitions can be exogenous or endogenous.
b. Kinetic's NuSMV verifier can verify that the data plane will never have loops.
c. State transitions can occur based on timing (e.g., a timeout).
d. The Kinetic controller can only process external events from routers and switches.
e. Pyretic's composition operators can help prevent state explosion.
",,"a,c,e","a,c,e",,"a. Kinetic policies can have state transitions triggered by external events (exogenous) or internal events (endogenous).b. Kinetic's NuSMV verifier cannot guarantee the data plane will never have loops. It checks the control plane is deterministic and that only one set of forwarding rules is installed at a time.c. Kinetic policies can transition state based on timeouts, which is an example of an endogenous event.d. The Kinetic controller can process external events from end hosts in addition to network devices. e. Pyretic's composition operators like parallel and sequential composition can help manage cross-product state explosion in Kinetic policies.Therefore, the correct answers are options a, c, and e.",['https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi15/nsdi15-paper-kim.pdf'],1,14_verification,0.9,1

b. None of the above.
c. SPEC A [ policy=allow U authenticated ]
d. SPEC AG (authenticated -> AX policy=allow)
e. SPEC AG (EF policy=allow)
",,e,e,,"The given statement can be translated as: It is always (AG) possible (EF) for the policy state to go to 'allow'. This matches option e: SPEC AG (EF policy=allow).The other options are incorrect:a. This says if not authenticated, then in all next states policy will be allow. This is different from the given statement.b. The correct answer is present in the options.c. This says policy will be allow until authenticated, which is not the same as the given statement.d. This says if authenticated, then in all next states policy will be allow.
