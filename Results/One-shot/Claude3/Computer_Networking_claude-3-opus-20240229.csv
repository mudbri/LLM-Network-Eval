c. NTP
d. NAT
",,c,c,,"The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used for time synchronization in a network. NTP is designed to synchronize the clocks of computers over a network to a common time reference, usually Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). It uses a hierarchical system of time sources, with primary servers at the root and secondary servers and clients below. NTP provides mechanisms to synchronize time and coordinate time distribution in a large, diverse network with varying latency and reliability. The other options are not related to time synchronization: ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) maps IP addresses to MAC addresses, DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) assigns IP addresses to devices, and NAT (Network Address Translation) enables multiple devices to share a single public IP address.","['https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5905', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol']",1,Computer_Networking,1,1

b. WPA
c. WPA2
d. WPA3
",,a,a,,"WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is an outdated wireless security protocol that is vulnerable to brute-force attacks. WEP uses a weak encryption algorithm (RC4) with a small key size (40 or 104 bits), making it relatively easy for attackers to crack the encryption by trying all possible key combinations. WEP also lacks other important security features like key management and message integrity checks. In contrast, newer protocols like WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 use stronger encryption algorithms (e.g., AES) with larger key sizes and additional security mechanisms, making them much more resistant to brute-force attacks. Therefore, option a (WEP) is the correct answer.","['https://www.networkworld.com/article/2332991/why-wep-wireless-security-is-so-vulnerable-to-attack.html', 'https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos-space-apps/network-director3.7/topics/concept/wireless-ssid-wep-wpa-wpa2-about.html']",1,Computer_Networking,0.95,1

While mesh networking and Wi-Fi Direct also allow device-to-device communication, they are not the best answers here.
