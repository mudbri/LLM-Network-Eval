204,"The customer edge device is typically a router, that sits at a customer site on MPLS networks and connects to a provider edge router (PE router) to take communications from a customer site to a provider side.","a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",,a,a,,"The statement is true. In an MPLS network, the customer edge (CE) device is typically a router located at the customer's premises. It connects to the provider edge (PE) router, which is the service provider's device. The CE router is responsible for forwarding customer traffic to the PE router, which then uses MPLS labels to transport the traffic across the service provider's network to the destination. The CE router is managed by the customer, while the PE router is managed by the service provider.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_edge_router', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/routers/wan-automation-engine/white_paper_c11-728587.html']",1,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,1
205,____________________ is a network design that connects a link between each pair of nodes.,"a. Full Mesh
b. Star
c. Hybrid
d. Partial Mesh
",,a,a,,"A full mesh network is a network topology in which there is a direct link between all pairs of nodes. In a full mesh topology, every node is connected to every other node in the network. This provides a high level of redundancy and fault tolerance, as there are multiple paths between any two nodes. However, full mesh networks can be complex and expensive to implement, especially as the number of nodes grows, since the number of links required increases exponentially with each additional node.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology#Mesh', 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-topologies-full-mesh-partial-mesh-and-hybrid-mesh/']",1,chapter12_network_design_architecture,1,1
206,"With PoE, a LAN switch can act as the Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE).","a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",,a,a,,"The statement is true. With Power over Ethernet (PoE), a LAN switch can indeed act as the Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE). PoE allows the switch to deliver both data and electrical power over the same Ethernet cable to a powered device (PD) such as an IP phone, wireless access point, or security camera. The switch, acting as the PSE, injects power onto the Ethernet cable which is then extracted by the PD. This simplifies cabling and eliminates the need for separate power supplies for each network device.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/switches/what-is-power-over-ethernet.html']",1,chapter12_network_design_architecture,1,1
208,Which of the following roles of campus switches provides a connection point for end-user devices?,"a. Access
b. Distribution
c. Core
d. Campus
",,a,a,,"The access layer of a campus network provides the connection point for end-user devices to connect to the network. Access layer switches are typically located close to the end users and provide network access for devices such as computers, IP phones, printers, etc. The distribution and core layers are higher in the hierarchy and provide aggregation and routing between access layer switches and the rest of the network. The campus itself is not a specific role of a switch, but rather refers to the overall network within a limited geographic area like a company or university.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_internetworking_model#Access_layer', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Campus/HA_campus_DG/hacampusdg.html']",1,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,1

d. Campus
",,b,b,,"The distribution layer of a campus network provides an aggregation point for access layer switches. Access layer switches connect end devices like computers, printers, IP phones etc. These access switches then connect into distribution layer switches which aggregate the connections. The distribution layer provides important functions like routing between VLANs, implementing access control policies, and aggregating toward the core layer. The core layer provides high-speed switching backbone for the network.

The core layer provides a high-speed switching backbone to move traffic between distribution switches. The core layer is the top layer in the hierarchical campus network design model, sitting above the distribution and access layers. Access layer switches connect end devices, while distribution layer switches aggregate the access layer and provide routing between VLANs. But in the largest campus networks, the core layer is added above distribution to provide a high-speed backbone interconnecting the distribution layer switches.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Campus/HA_campus_DG/hacampusdg.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_internetworking_model']",1,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,1
211,Your company plans to start using public cloud service and now you are considering different WAN options. Your main concern is security by keeping the data private while also providing good QoS services. Which of the following options are under consideration? (Choose two answers.),"a. Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider
b. Using an Internet connection without VPN
c. Using an Internet connection with VPN
d. Using an intercloud exchange
",,"a,d","a,c",,"Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider (a) and using an Internet connection with VPN (c) are the two options that would best address the security and QoS concerns. Private WAN connections, often called 'direct connect' by cloud providers, establish a dedicated private link between the company network and the cloud, keeping data off the public Internet. A VPN over the Internet connection would encrypt the data, keeping it private, though QoS may be less predictable than a private WAN link. Using the Internet without VPN (b) would expose data and not meet the security requirement. An intercloud exchange (d) connects different cloud providers but doesn't directly address the company's connectivity to the cloud.","['https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/networking/networking-overview', 'https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/introducing-aws-direct-connect-sitelink-dedicated-connectivity-between-direct-connect-points-of-presence/']",0,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.9,1
