32,What are some of the reasons that it is difficult to deploy improvements to BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. Changes are necessarily incremental because of the large installed base of routers that already run BGP.
b. BGP is implemented in hardware, so deploying changes to BGP requires changes on the timescale of hardware development cycles.
c. Deplyoing changes to BGP requires coordination across potentially tens of thousands of ASes in the Internet.
d. Only a few vendors implement BGP, and deploying changes requires convincing those vendors to change the protocol.
e. Deploying changes requires coordination in standards bodies such as the IETF.
",,"a,c,e","a,c,e",,"a. This is correct. The large installed base of BGP routers makes it difficult to make non-incremental changes, as it would require updating a huge number of devices.b. This is incorrect. BGP is typically implemented in software, not hardware. c. This is correct. BGP is used to exchange routing information between tens of thousands of Autonomous Systems (ASes) on the Internet. Any change would need to be coordinated across all of these ASes to ensure continued interoperability.d. This is incorrect. While there are a few major router vendors, BGP is an open standard and there are many implementations, both commercial and open source.e. This is correct. As an Internet standard, changes to BGP need to go through the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standardization process to ensure consensus and compatibility.","['https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall16/cos561/papers/BGPSecurity.pdf', 'https://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs/']",1,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.95,1
33,Which of the following are true about the RCP? Select all that apply.,"a. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, the RCP controller for an AS sees all routes for all destinations that an AS learns from neighboring ASes.
b. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, there is no need for ASes to use BGP to exchange routes.
c. In an RCP deployment, routers no longer have to compute routes.
d. The RCP controller operates just like a route reflector would, selecting a single best route for each destination for all client routers.
e. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, a single AS can benefit from deploying RCP even if no other ASes deploy RCP.
",,"c,e","a,c,e",,"a. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, the RCP controller sees all routes that the AS learns from neighboring ASes. This allows it to have a complete view of the routing information for the AS.b. In Phase 1, BGP is still used between ASes to exchange routes. RCP is used within the AS to disseminate routes to the routers.c. With RCP, the route computation is offloaded from the routers to the RCP controller. Routers no longer need to perform this computation themselves.d. The RCP controller does not operate like a route reflector. It computes unique routes for each router based on the complete set of routes and the router's role and location.e. A single AS can benefit from RCP in Phase 1 even if other ASes have not deployed it. The benefits are in the centralized route computation and dissemination within the AS.Therefore, the correct answers are options a, c, and e.","['http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/papers/rcp-hotnets.pdf', 'https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/papers/rcp-thesis.pdf']",0,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.9,1
34,"Which of the following are true about network management with BGP, in the absence of RCP? Select all that apply.","a. BGP's interaction with the underlying routing IGP routing protocol can result in persistent forwarding loops.
b. Implementing network-wide policy sometimes causes the routers themeselves to have to carry state.
c. Each router operates and makes decisions based only on a local view of network state.
d. BGP routing has a single point of failure.
e. It is not possible to perform traffic engineering with conventional BGP.
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"a. BGP can cause persistent forwarding loops due to its interaction with the IGP. Without a centralized view, the combination of BGP and IGP can lead to inconsistencies.b. To implement network-wide policies, BGP requires carrying additional state on the routers themselves. There is no separate control plane to maintain this state.c. In conventional BGP, each router operates based on its own local view of network state obtained through peering. There is no centralized global network view.d. BGP is a distributed protocol and does not inherently have a single point of failure. e. While traffic engineering is more challenging with BGP compared to centralized solutions, it is still possible to perform some degree of traffic engineering using techniques like BGP communities, AS path prepending, etc.Therefore, the correct answers are options a, b, and c, which highlight limitations of decentralized management with BGP.","['https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/papers/4d09.pdf', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/13751-35.html']",1,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.9,1
35,Which of the following is true about the second phase of RCP deployment? Select all that apply.,"a. The second phase of RCP deployment requires no coordination with neighboring ASes.
b. The second phase of RCP deployment offers potential benefits such as reduced routing table size.
c. In the second phase of deployment, the RCP controller sees all routes for every destination that neighboring ASes advertise.
d. The second phase of deployment requires fewer BGP sessions at the RCP controller than the first phase, thus improving scalability of the controller.
e. In the second phase of RCP deployment, ASes do not need to use BGP to exchange routes with one another.
",,"b,c","b,c,e",,"a. This is false. The second phase of RCP deployment requires coordination with neighboring ASes to have them send all routes to the RCP controller.b. This is true. By having the RCP controller select routes on behalf of the AS, the routing table size can be reduced compared to having each router in the AS compute its own routes.c. This is true. In the second phase, the RCP controller receives all routes from neighboring ASes to perform route selection on behalf of the local AS.d. This is false. The second phase requires more BGP sessions at the RCP controller than the first phase, because the RCP controller needs sessions with neighboring ASes in addition to the iBGP sessions with routers in the local AS.e. This is true. Since the RCP controller exchanges routes with neighboring ASes on behalf of the local AS, the individual routers in the AS do not need to use BGP to exchange routes with one another.",['https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/papers/rcp-ton.pdf'],0,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.9,1
36,"In terms of the parlance of the 4D architecture, which protocol serves as the ""dissemination plane"" for the RCP?","a. External BGP
b. Spanning Tree Protocol
c. The Internal Gateway Protocol (IGP)
d. Internal BGP
e. LLDP
",,d,d,,"In the 4D architecture, the dissemination plane is responsible for distributing the output of the decision plane to the individual network elements. For the Routing Control Platform (RCP), this dissemination is done using Internal BGP (iBGP). The RCP acts as a centralized control platform, computing the routing tables based on high-level policies, and then uses iBGP sessions to install these routes on the individual routers in the AS. Therefore, iBGP serves as the dissemination plane protocol for the RCP.","['https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/papers/4d-hotnets05.pdf', 'https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/papers/rcp-sigcomm05.pdf']",1,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.9,1

c. Simpler management systems
d. Faster innovation
e. Simpler routers and switches
",,"c,d,e","a,c,d,e",,"The 4D architecture aims to simplify the control plane to achieve several goals:a. Improved security: By centralizing the control logic and using direct control, the architecture can provide better security enforcement and reduce vulnerabilities.c.

Faster innovation: Simplifying the control plane and using a logically centralized controller enables faster development and deployment of new network functionality.e. Simpler routers and switches: Moving control logic out of the routers/switches allows them to be simpler and focus solely on the data plane forwarding.While the 4D architecture can lead to a more robust control plane (b), this is not explicitly stated as one of the primary goals of simplifying the control plane itself.",['https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/papers/4d-hotnets05.pdf'],0,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.9,1

Keeping track of topology information is a necessary function but not an example of amortizing overhead.  d. Performing route computation on behalf of all routers in the AS amortizes the computational overhead of each router performing this independently.e.

Provisioning a BGP session is a local configuration task, not a network-wide objective. c. Load balancing traffic globally across the network is a network-wide objective that the decision plane could achieve by computing suitable routing weights.d. Ensuring predictable behavior during maintenance is a network-wide objective that the decision plane could achieve by computing configurations that gracefully shift traffic away from the devices under maintenance.e.
