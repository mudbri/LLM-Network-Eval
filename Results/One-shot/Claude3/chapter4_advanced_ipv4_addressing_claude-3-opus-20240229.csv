",,a,a,,"The correct answer is A. To determine the subnet ID, we perform a bitwise AND operation between the IP address and the subnet mask. In this case, 20.54.23.3 AND 255.255.255.0 results in 20.54.23.0, which is the subnet ID. The broadcast address for a subnet is the last address in that subnet, where the host portion is all binary 1s. With a /24 subnet mask (255.255.255.0), the host portion is the last octet. Setting all bits in the last octet to 1 gives us 20.54.23.255, which is the broadcast address for this subnet.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html']",1,chapter4_advanced_ipv4_addressing,1,1
