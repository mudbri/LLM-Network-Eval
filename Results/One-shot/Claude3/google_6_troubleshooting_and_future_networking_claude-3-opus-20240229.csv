90,The protocol used to communicate network errors is known as __________.,"a. ICMP
b. Traceroute
c. TCP
d. UDP
",,a,a,,"ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is used to communicate network errors and operational information between network devices. It is used by tools like ping and traceroute to troubleshoot network issues. TCP and UDP are transport layer protocols used for data transfer, not for error reporting. Traceroute is a tool that uses ICMP to map network paths, but is not a protocol itself.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/internet-control-message-protocol-icmp/']",1,google_6_troubleshooting_and_future_networking,1,1
91,The ping utility sends what message type?,"a. Echo Request
b. Echo Reply
c. Destination Network Unknown
