91,You have noticed that a server with IP 145.45.3.2 doesn’t respond to requests. What command will you type first in order to test connectivity between your device and the server?,"a. request 145.45.3.2
b. check 145.45.3.2
c. ping 145.45.3.2
d. ping 145.45.3.2
",,c,c,,"The ping command is the most common way to test basic IP connectivity between two devices. It sends ICMP echo request packets to the target IP address (145.45.3.2 in this case) and expects ICMP echo replies back, confirming that the target IP is reachable and responsive. If the server at 145.45.3.2 is not responding, the ping command will timeout waiting for replies, indicating a connectivity issue that needs further investigation.",['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)'],1,chapter5_ipv4_routing,1,1
92,"A LAN design uses a Layer 3 EtherChannel between two switches SW1 and SW2, with port-channel interface 1 used on both switches. SW1 uses ports G0/1 and G0/2 in the channel. However, only interface G0/1 is bundled into the channel and working. Think about the configuration settings on port G0/2 that could have existed before adding G0/2 to the EtherChannel. Which answers identify a setting that could prevent IOS from adding G0/2 to the Layer 3 EtherChannel? (Choose two answers.)","a. A different STP cost (spanning-tree cost value)
b. A different access VLAN (switchport access vlan vlanid)
c. A different speed (speed value)
d. A default setting for switchport (switchport)
",,"c,d","b,d",,"B and D are the correct answers. For a Layer 3 EtherChannel, all physical interfaces must not be configured as switchports (Layer 2 ports). The switchport command configures the interface as a Layer 2 port, making it ineligible for a Layer 3 EtherChannel. Similarly, if an interface is configured with the switchport access vlan command, it is also a Layer 2 port and cannot be added to a Layer 3 EtherChannel. The spanning-tree cost and speed settings do not prevent an interface from being added to a Layer 3 EtherChannel. Those settings can differ on the physical interfaces in an EtherChannel without causing problems.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750x_3560x/software/release/12-2_55_se/configuration/guide/3750xscg/swethchl.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/lan-switching/etherchannel/12023-4.html']",0,chapter5_ipv4_routing,0.95,1
