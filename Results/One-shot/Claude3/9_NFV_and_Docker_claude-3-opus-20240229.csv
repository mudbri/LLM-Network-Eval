72,"In NFV, which of the following is the function of steering?","a. Finding the best location to place a single network function in an enterprise or wide area network.
b. Installing custom packet processing code on servers in the network.
c. Placing middleboxes at places throughout the network to minimize network load.
d. Installing custom packet processing code on switches in the network.
e. Installing flow table entries in switches to forward traffic through network functions or middleboxes that are installed in the network
",,e,e,,"In Network Function Virtualization (NFV), steering refers to the process of directing network traffic through a sequence of network functions or middleboxes. This is typically achieved by installing flow table entries in switches that forward packets to the appropriate network functions based on predefined policies or service chains. The other options, while related to NFV, do not accurately describe the specific function of steering.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/network-functions-virtualization-nfv/white-paper-c11-736984.html', 'https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/flow-based-processing/topics/concept/steering-vnf.html']",1,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.9,1
74,What are some advantages of Docker containers over virtual machines? Select all that apply.,"a. Containers can be connected to build a virtual network, whereas virtual machines cannot.
b. Performance in containers may be better since they invoke OS system calls directly, rather than through an emulated machine.
c. Containers require less storage and memory per-instance, and require less time to instantiate than virtual machines.
d. Containers provide more flexibility in the choice of operating system.
e. Containers provide better isolation than virtual machines.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"a. Both containers and virtual machines can be connected to build virtual networks. This is not an advantage of one over the other.b. Containers run directly on the host OS and make system calls to the host kernel, avoiding the overhead of an emulated machine. This can lead to better performance compared to VMs.c. Containers are more lightweight than VMs as they share the host OS kernel and libraries. They require less storage, memory and startup time than a full VM.d. Containers actually provide less flexibility in OS choice as they must use the same kernel as the host. VMs allow running any OS.e. VMs provide stronger isolation than containers as each VM runs its own full OS instance. Containers share the host kernel so isolation is weaker.In summary, the main advantages of containers over VMs are the potential performance benefits and the lower resource requirements per instance.","['https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/containers-vs-vms', 'https://cloud.google.com/containers-vs-vms', 'https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/']",1,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.95,1
75,Which of the following commands is used to instantiate a new Docker container by invoking a command in that container?,"a. docker stop
b. docker attach
c. docker commit
d. docker pull
e. docker run
",,e,e,,"The 'docker run' command is used to create a new container and start it. It can be used to invoke a specific command inside the newly created container. The other options are used for different purposes:a. 'docker stop' is used to stop a running container.b. 'docker attach' is used to attach to a running container. c. 'docker commit' is used to create a new image from a container's changes.d. 'docker pull' is used to pull an image from a registry.Therefore, the correct answer is option e, 'docker run'.",['https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/'],1,9_NFV_and_Docker,1,1
76,Which of the following is true about networking Docker containers? Select all that apply.,"a. Docker containers can be networked to each other via the native Docker bridge or Open vSwitch.
b. A Docker container can never expose a low port (e.g., port 80) to the external Internet; Internet hosts must always reach a Docker service by a high port (e.g., 8080).
c. Docker containers running in different virtual machines cannot be networked together.
d. Connecting Docker containers requires setting up GRE tunnels between the containers.
e. Docker containers are not reachable from the external Internet by default.
",,"a,e","a,e",,"a. Docker containers can indeed be networked to each other using the native Docker bridge or Open vSwitch. This allows containers to communicate with each other.b. This is false. Docker containers can expose any port, including low ports like 80, to the external Internet using port mapping.c. This is false. Docker containers running in different VMs can be networked together using overlay networks or other networking solutions.d. This is false. Connecting Docker containers does not require GRE tunnels. Docker provides its own networking solutions like bridge networks and overlay networks.e. This is true. By default, Docker containers are not accessible from the external Internet for security reasons. Port mapping or other network configuration is needed to make them externally reachable.Therefore, the correct answers are options a and e.","['https://docs.docker.com/network/', 'https://www.docker.com/blog/understanding-docker-networking-drivers-use-cases/']",1,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.95,1
