",,d,d,,"Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) is the correct answer. EGP is a routing protocol designed to exchange routing information between different autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet. An autonomous system is a collection of networks under a common administration and with common routing policies. EGP is used to exchange routing information between these autonomous systems. Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) like OSPF and EIGRP, on the other hand, are used inside an autonomous system to exchange routing information between routers within that AS.
