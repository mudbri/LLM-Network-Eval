16,Which of the following command is used to generate an OpenFlow network topology consisting of a single switch and 8 hosts with randomly generated MAC addresses for each host?,"a. sudo mn --topo single,8  --switch ovsk --controller remote
b. sudo mn --topo single,3 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
c. sudo mn --topo single,8 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
d. sudo mn --topo linear,8  --switch ovsk --controller remote
",,a,c,,"The correct command to generate an OpenFlow network topology with a single switch and 8 hosts, each with randomly generated MAC addresses, is:sudo mn --topo single,8 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remoteBreaking down the command:- '--topo single,8' specifies a single switch topology with 8 hosts.- '--mac' option automatically assigns MAC addresses to hosts.- '--switch ovsk' sets the switch to use Open vSwitch in kernel mode.- '--controller remote' specifies the use of a remote controller.Options a and d are incorrect because they do not include the '--mac' option to randomly generate MAC addresses for each host. Option b has the wrong number of hosts (3 instead of 8).","['http://mininet.org/walkthrough/#part-1-everyday-mininet-usage', 'https://github.com/mininet/openflow-tutorial/wiki/Create-a-Learning-Switch']",0,3_mininet_setup,0.95,1
17,What is the purpose of --mac flag used in mininet?,"a. Generates random MAC addresses for the hosts.
b. Generates sequential MAC addresses for the hosts, matching their IP address.
c. Generates sequential MAC addresses for the switch ports, matching their IP address.
d. Generates random MAC addresses for the switch ports.
",,b,b,,"The --mac flag in Mininet is used to generate sequential MAC addresses for the hosts that match their IP addresses. This means that the host h1 with IP 10.0.0.1 will have a MAC address of 00:00:00:00:00:01, h2 with IP 10.0.0.2 will have MAC 00:00:00:00:00:02, and so on. This is useful for testing and debugging purposes, as it makes it easy to identify which host corresponds to which MAC address. The --mac flag does not affect the MAC addresses of switch ports.","['http://mininet.org/api/classmininet_1_1node_1_1Host.html', 'https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Introduction-to-Mininet#host-options']",1,3_mininet_setup,0.95,1
20,"What is the purpose of dpctl, provided with mininet?","a. To enable visibility and control over a single switchâ€™s flow table.
b. To enable visibility and control over multiple switch flow table.
c. Is an OpenFlow controller.
",,a,a,,"dpctl is a command line utility provided with Mininet that allows visibility and control over a single OpenFlow switch's flow table. It can be used to add, delete, or modify flow table entries on an individual switch. However, it does not provide control over multiple switches simultaneously, nor does it act as an OpenFlow controller itself. Therefore, the correct answer is option a.","['http://mininet.org/walkthrough/#dpctl-commands', 'https://github.com/mininet/openflow-tutorial/wiki/Learn-Development-Tools#dpctl']",1,3_mininet_setup,0.95,1
