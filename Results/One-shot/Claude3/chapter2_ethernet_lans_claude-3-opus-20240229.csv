d. show status interface
",,c,c,,"The command 'show interface status' is used to check the status of interfaces on Cisco network devices. It provides a summary of the interfaces, their physical status (connected or not), duplex mode, speed, and VLAN assignment. The other options are not valid commands for checking interface status.

",,a,a,,"The correct answer is 'copy running-config startup-config'. This command copies the current running configuration, which is stored in RAM (Random Access Memory), to the startup configuration file in NVRAM (Non-Volatile RAM). This ensures that the changes made to the running configuration are saved and will be loaded the next time the device starts up.

b. Enable mode
c. Interface configuration mode
d. VLAN mode
",,c,c,,"Interface configuration mode is the correct answer. To configure settings for a specific interface, like duplex mode for Fast Ethernet 0/2, you need to enter interface configuration mode for that interface. This is done by using the 'interface' command from global configuration mode, specifying the interface (e.g., 'interface FastEthernet 0/2'). Once in interface configuration mode, you can use the 'duplex' command to set the duplex mode.

27,"Switches use STP to prevent loops by causing some interfaces to block, meaning that they do not send or receive frames.","a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",,a,a,,"The statement is true. Switches use the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to logically break loops in the Layer 2 topology by blocking ports. The blocked ports do not send or receive data frames, thus preventing loops while still allowing physical redundancy in the network topology. STP calculates the best loop-free path through the network and blocks redundant links to create a logical spanning tree topology. This prevents broadcast storms and MAC address table instability caused by loops.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_Tree_Protocol', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/tech/lan-switching/spanning-tree-protocol/index.html']",1,chapter2_ethernet_lans,1,1
28,A Layer 2 switch configuration places all its physical ports into VLAN 2. The IP addressing plan shows that address 175.28.1.150 (with mask 255.255.255.0) is reserved for use by this new LAN switch and that 175.28.1.254 is already configured on the router connected to that same VLAN. The switch needs to support SSH connections into the switch from any subnet in the network. Which of the following commands are part of the required configuration in this case? (Choose two answers.),"a. The switch cannot support SSH because all its ports connect to VLAN 2, and the IP address must be configured on interface VLAN 1.
b. The ip address 175.28.1.150 255.255.255.0 command in interface vlan 2 configuration mode.
c. The ip default-gateway 175.28.1.254 command in global configuration mode.
d. The ip address 172.16.2.250 255.255.255.0 command in interface vlan 1 configuration mode.
e. The ip default-gateway 175.28.1.150 command in global configuration mode.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"The correct answers are B and C. To support SSH access to the switch from any subnet, the switch needs an IP address configured on a VLAN interface (SVI) and a default gateway pointing to the router. With all ports assigned to VLAN 2, the SVI should be configured for VLAN 2 using the 'ip address 175.28.1.150 255.255.255.0' command under interface vlan 2 configuration mode. The default gateway is set to the router's IP 175.28.1.254 using the 'ip default-gateway 175.28.1.254' command in global configuration mode.
