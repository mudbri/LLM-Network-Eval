46,What transport layer protocol does DNS normally use?,"a. TCP
b. IP
c. UDP
d. ICMP
",,c,c,,"DNS normally uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) as its transport layer protocol. UDP provides a lightweight, connectionless service that is well-suited for the small queries and responses typical of DNS. UDP allows for faster transmission compared to TCP, as it has lower overhead and does not require establishing a connection before sending data. However, in some cases, such as when the DNS response is too large to fit in a single UDP packet (exceeding 512 bytes), DNS may fall back to using TCP for transport.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System#Protocol_transport']",1,google_4_networking_serices,0.95,1
