1,Which of the following terms describe Ethernet addresses that can send one frame and is delivered to multiple devices on the LAN? (Choose two answers.),"a. Broadcast address
b. Multicast address
c. IP address
d. MAC address
e. Unicast address
",,"a,b","a,b",,Broadcast and multicast addresses are the correct answers that describe Ethernet addresses that can send one frame to be delivered to multiple devices on a LAN. A broadcast address (FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF) allows a frame to be sent to all devices on the LAN segment. A multicast address (first octet is an odd number between 0x01 and 0x0F) allows a frame to be sent to a specific subset of devices on the LAN that have subscribed to that multicast group. An IP address operates at Layer 3 and does not directly determine Ethernet delivery. MAC and unicast addresses refer to a single device on the LAN and cannot be used to send to multiple devices with a single frame.,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_address', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/ip-multicast/13773-57.html']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,0.95,1
3,___________ is a set of rules determining how network devices respond when two devices attempt to use a data channel simultaneously and encounter a data collision.,"a. CSMA/CD
b. CSMA/CA
c. TCP/IP
d. TCP/UDP
",,a,a,,"CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) is the correct answer. It is a media access control method used most notably in early Ethernet technology. This set of rules determines how network devices respond when two devices send data at the same time on the local network, resulting in a collision. The devices will stop transmitting, wait for a random time interval, and then retry the transmission. CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) is used in wireless networks to avoid collisions. TCP/IP and TCP/UDP are unrelated to collision handling - they are protocols that define how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed and received at the destination.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-sense_multiple_access_with_collision_detection', 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/collision-detection-csmacd/']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,0.95,1

5,Which of the following IEEE 802.3 Ethernet Header and Trailer Fields allows devices on the network to easily synchronize their receiver clocks?,"a. Frame Check Sequence
b. Data and Pad
c. Start Frame Delimiter
d. Preamble
",,d,d,,"The preamble field in the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet header allows devices to synchronize their receiver clocks. The preamble consists of a 56-bit pattern of alternating 1s and 0s that enables the receiving devices on the network to easily synchronize their receiver clocks to the transmitter's clock, allowing for proper reception of the frame. The start frame delimiter marks the end of the preamble and start of the frame. The data and pad fields contain the actual payload data. The frame check sequence provides error detection. So the preamble, not the other fields, is what enables receiver clock synchronization.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame', 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ethernet-frame-format/']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,0.95,1
6,The host sends packets to its default gateway if the ____________ IP address is in a different subnet than the host.,"a. Source
b. Destination
c. Unicast
d. Broadcast
",,b,b,,"The host sends packets to its default gateway if the destination IP address is in a different subnet than the host. When a host needs to communicate with another device, it first checks if the destination IP is on the same subnet. If not, the host forwards the packet to its configured default gateway, which is responsible for routing the packet to the appropriate next hop to eventually reach the destination subnet. The source IP address is always the host's own IP and does not determine whether the default gateway is used. Unicast and broadcast are types of IP communication and also do not directly influence the use of the default gateway.",['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_gateway'],1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,0.95,1

b. Switch and PC
c. Hub and switch
d. Router and hub
",,"b,d","a,b",,"A straight-through Ethernet cable is used to connect devices of different types, such as a router to a PC or a switch to a PC. The wiring is straight through, meaning pins 1 through 8 on one end of the cable connect to pins 1 through 8 on the other end respectively. Routers, PCs, and servers are considered end devices and typically use the T568A or T568B wiring standard on their Ethernet ports. Switches and hubs are considered intermediate devices and typically use the opposite wiring standard of the end device. So connecting an end device like a router or PC to an intermediate device like a switch or hub requires a straight-through cable.

b. Advertising known routes to neighboring routers
c. Learning routes for subnets directly connected to the router
d. Forwarding IP packets based on a packet’s destination IP address
",,"a,b","a,b",,"Routing protocols perform two key functions: learning routes from neighboring routers and advertising known routes to neighboring routers. The routing protocol learns routes from the advertisements sent by neighboring routers. Those learned routes are then placed into the routing table. The routing protocol also advertises the routes it knows to its neighbors. A router can learn routes for directly connected subnets, but this is not a function of the routing protocol. The routing protocol only learns routes advertised to it by other routers. Forwarding IP packets based on the destination IP address is a function of the router's forwarding logic, not the routing protocol.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_protocol', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/iproute_pi/configuration/xe-3s/iri-xe-3s-book/iri-ip-prot.html']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,1,1

b. FALSE
",,a,a,,"The statement is true. When a user types a hostname like www.examsdigest.com into a web browser, the computer does not send IP packets directly to that hostname. Instead, it first uses the Domain Name System (DNS) to resolve the hostname to the corresponding IP address of the web server hosting the website. Once the IP address is obtained, the computer then sends the IP packets to that resolved IP address. DNS acts as a distributed database that maps human-readable domain names to IP addresses, allowing computers to locate and communicate with each other on the internet or other IP networks.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,1,1

19,TCP and ______________ are the two most commonly used TCP/IP transport layer protocols.,"a. UDP
b. HTTP
c. DNS
d. SMTP
",,a,a,,"UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is the correct answer. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP are the two most commonly used transport layer protocols in the TCP/IP protocol suite. TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications running on hosts communicating over an IP network. UDP, on the other hand, is a simpler, connectionless protocol that provides a lightweight, unreliable datagram service. HTTP, DNS, and SMTP are application layer protocols that typically run on top of TCP or UDP, but are not themselves transport layer protocols.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13769-5.html']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,1,1

b. Data and Pad
c. Start Frame Delimiter
d. Preamble
",,a,a,,"The Frame Check Sequence (FCS) field in the Ethernet frame trailer provides a method for the receiving NIC to determine if the frame experienced any transmission errors. The FCS contains a 32-bit Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) value calculated by the sending device based on the frame contents. The receiving device recalculates the CRC and compares it to the FCS value received. If they match, the frame is considered error-free. If they differ, it indicates the frame was corrupted during transmission and is discarded by the receiving NIC.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/lan-switching/8021x/17513-22.html']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,1,1
