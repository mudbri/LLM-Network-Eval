43,Which of the following statements are true about the OpenFlow specification? Select all that apply.,"a. If a switch does not contain a flow table entry that matches a particular packet, the switch forwards the packet to the controller for handling.
b. The main purpose of the OpenFlow control channel is to update flow table entries on switches.
c. The OpenFlow specification provides mechanisms to perform Layer 2 learning across a network of switches.
d. Once a switch has sent one packet for a flow, it must also send all subsequent packets for that flow to the controller.
e. Some versions of the OpenFlow specification allow for performing more than one action on a single packet.
",,"a,b,e","a,b,e",,"a. This is correct. If no matching flow entry is found, the switch sends the packet to the controller over the OpenFlow channel.b. This is one of the main purposes of the OpenFlow control channel. The controller uses it to add, update, and delete flow entries in the switch's flow tables.c. The OpenFlow specification itself does not provide L2 learning mechanisms. This would be implemented by the SDN controller if desired.d. This is false. Once the controller has set up the appropriate flow entry in the switch, subsequent packets in that flow are handled by the switch without involving the controller.e. Later versions of OpenFlow (1.1+) allow multiple actions to be specified for a single flow entry and applied to matching packets.Therefore, statements a, b, and e are true about the OpenFlow specification.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/openflow-switch-v1.5.1.pdf', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/openflow-protocol']",1,6_control_plane,0.95,1

47,Which of the following are true about Pox? Select all that apply.,"a. Pox automatically determines the order to install flow table rules, to avoid inconsistent forwarding behavior.
b. Pox's _handle_PacketIn function determines how a packet should be handled when it arrives at the controller.
c. Pox provides a function to modify flow table entries at a switch.
d. Pox's performance is typically slower than NOX.
e. Pox automatically determines the priority between two conflicting rules.
",,"b,c,d","b,c,d",,"a. Pox does not automatically determine the order to install flow table rules. It is up to the controller to ensure that rules are installed in the correct order to avoid inconsistencies.b. The _handle_PacketIn function in Pox is called when a packet arrives at the controller. This function determines how the packet should be handled.c. Pox provides a function called of.ofp_flow_mod() that can be used to modify flow table entries at a switch.d. Pox is written in Python, which is generally slower than C++, the language used for NOX. Therefore, Pox's performance is typically slower than NOX.e. Pox does not automatically determine the priority between conflicting rules. The controller must specify the priority when installing rules to ensure the desired behavior.Therefore, the correct answers are options b, c, and d.","['https://openflow.stanford.edu/display/ONL/POX+Wiki', 'https://github.com/noxrepo/pox', 'https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261476114_Performance_Analysis_of_POX_OpenFlow_Controller']",1,6_control_plane,0.9,1
48,What is the difference between a hard timeout and an idle timeout?,"a. A hard timeout occurs exactly at the specified interval, whereas an idle timeout may occur slightly later than the specified interval.
b. A hard timeout expunges a flow table entry regardless of whether there have been active matches, whereas an idle timeout expunges the flow table entry only if there have been no matches for that flow within the specified interval.
c. A hard timeout expunges all flow table entry from the switch, whereas an idle timeout only expunges one flow at a time.
d. A hard timeout expunges a flow table entry for all switches in the network, whereas an idle timeout only expunges the flow table entry on the switches that have seen no matches for that flow within the specified interval.
",,b,b,,"The key difference between a hard timeout and an idle timeout is in how they determine when to remove a flow table entry. A hard timeout will remove the entry after the specified time interval regardless of whether there have been any matches for that flow. In contrast, an idle timeout only removes the entry if there have been no matches for that flow within the specified time interval. The other options are incorrect:a. Both types of timeouts should occur at the specified interval. c. Both types of timeouts only remove a single flow entry, not all entries.d. Both types of timeouts only affect the flow entry on the local switch, not across the whole network.Therefore, the correct answer is b.","['https://ryu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ofproto_v1_3_ref.html#flow-instructions', 'https://floodlight.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/floodlightcontroller/pages/1343633/How+to+Work+with+Fast-Failover+OpenFlow+1.1+Tutorial']",1,6_control_plane,0.95,1
49,Which of the following are true about hubs and learning switches? Select all that apply,"a. A hub implemented in Pox requires all incoming packets to be directed to the controller.
b. A learning switch requires more logic at the controller (in terms of lines of code in Pox) than a hub.
c. A learning switch implemented in Pox can be easily extended to support firewall capabilities.
d. A learning switch implemented in Pox requires all incoming packets to be redirected to the controller.
e. A hub forwards an incoming packet on all ports (except the incoming port), whereas a switch only floods an incoming packet on all ports if it does not have a table entry that determines the output port for that packet.
",,"b,c,e","c,e",,"a. A hub does not require the controller to process all packets. It simply floods packets out all ports except the incoming port.b. A learning switch requires less controller logic than a hub since it only sends packets to the controller when there is no existing flow entry. A hub sends all packets to the controller.c. Since a learning switch already maintains a flow table, firewall capabilities can be added by inserting additional flow entries to drop or allow certain packets based on policies.d. A learning switch only sends packets to the controller when there is no matching flow entry. Subsequent packets of the same flow are handled by the switch using the flow entry installed by the controller.e. This statement correctly describes the difference between how a hub and a learning switch handle incoming packets. A hub always floods while a switch only floods if there is no matching flow entry and sends the packet to the controller to determine forwarding.Therefore, the correct answers are options c and e.","['https://github.com/mininet/openflow-tutorial/wiki/Create-a-Learning-Switch', 'https://github.com/att/pox/blob/master/pox/forwarding/l2_learning.py', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch#Layer_2']",0,6_control_plane,0.95,1

b. _handle_PacketIn
c. AddRule
d. init
e. launch
",,a,"a,d",,"a. The connection.addListeners function is used to register the controller to receive PacketIn messages from switches.b. The _handle_PacketIn function processes received PacketIn messages, but does not ensure the controller will receive them in the first place.  c. AddRule is used to install flow table entries on switches, not to register for PacketIn messages.d. The init function is typically where the controller sets up its event listeners, including registering to receive PacketIn messages using connection.addListeners.e. The launch function starts the controller but does not directly handle registering for PacketIn messages.Therefore, the correct answers are options a and d, which ensure the controller registers to receive PacketIn messages.","['https://github.com/mininet/openflow-tutorial/wiki/Create-a-Learning-Switch', 'https://github.com/noxrepo/pox/blob/eel/pox/openflow/__init__.py']",0,6_control_plane,0.9,1
51,What are the two key steps of an OpenFlow flow table entry (select two)?,"a. match
b. action
c. redirect
d. drop
e. forward
",,"a,b","a,b",,"The two key steps of an OpenFlow flow table entry are:a. match: The match field is used to match against packet headers. It can match on various header fields like MAC addresses, IP addresses, ports, etc. b. action: When a packet matches an entry, the corresponding action is taken. This could be forwarding the packet to a port, dropping it, modifying some header fields, or sending it to the controller.The other options (redirect, drop, forward) are specific actions that can be taken, but are not the two key generic steps of a flow table entry. Every entry will have a match field and an action field.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/openflow-spec-v1.0.0.pdf', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-is-openflow/']",1,6_control_plane,1,1

d. Open Daylight only supports proprietary switches from Cisco and IBM.
e. It is slower and less scalable than some of the more lightweight SDN controllers such as Pox.
",,"a,c",a,,"a. OpenDaylight allows dynamic loading and reloading of modules without restarting the controller, which is one of its key features.b. OpenDaylight supports multiple southbound protocols and APIs beyond just OpenFlow, such as NETCONF and OVSDB. c. OpenDaylight is not based on the Beacon controller codebase. It was developed independently by the OpenDaylight consortium.d. OpenDaylight is designed to be vendor-neutral and supports a wide range of networking devices from many vendors, not just Cisco and IBM.e. OpenDaylight is designed for performance and scalability. As a more full-featured controller compared to lightweight options like POX, it may have some additional overhead, but it is not inherently slower or less scalable when properly deployed.Therefore, the only correct statement about OpenDaylight is option a.","['https://www.opendaylight.org/about/features', 'https://www.opendaylight.org/what-we-do/performance-scalability']",0,6_control_plane,0.95,1
