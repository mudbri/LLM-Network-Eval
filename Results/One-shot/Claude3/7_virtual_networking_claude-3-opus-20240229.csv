b. Refactors network control so that network behavior is controlled from a single logically centralized controller.
c. Separates logical and physical networks.
d. Often deployed in data center networks to allow multiple tenants to share physical network infrastructure.
e. Abstracts the details of the physical network.
",,"c,d,e","c,d,e",,"Virtual networks have the following characteristics:c. They separate the logical network view from the underlying physical network infrastructure. Multiple virtual networks can be overlaid on the same physical network.d. Virtual networks are commonly used in multi-tenant data centers to allow different customers (tenants) to share the same physical network hardware while maintaining isolation between their networks.e. The virtual network abstracts away the physical network details and presents a simplified logical network view to the user or application.While some virtual networks may separate the control and data planes (a) or use a centralized controller (b), these are defining characteristics of SDN but not necessarily of all virtual networks.Therefore, of the given options, c, d and e are characteristics of virtual networks but not defining characteristics of SDN.","['https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/virtual-networking', 'https://www.networkworld.com/article/3224893/what-is-a-virtual-network-a-definition-from-whatis-com.html']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.95,1

56,Which of the following are true of the Mininet network emulator? Select all that apply.,"a. It requires running OpenFlow-capable switches.
b. It is difficult to use it to route traffic for real services.
c. Mininet only allows users to create three types of topologies: linear, tree, and single-switch topologies.

e. All of the hosts in the topology must run the same underlying operating system.
",,"b,e","b,e",,"a. Mininet does not require running OpenFlow-capable switches. It can emulate OpenFlow switches in software.b. Mininet emulates a network on a single machine, so it is not well-suited for routing traffic for real services that need to communicate with the outside world. c. Mininet allows users to create arbitrary custom topologies, not just linear, tree, and single-switch topologies.d. Mininet runs on a single machine and cannot distribute the emulation across multiple physical nodes.e. All hosts in a Mininet topology share the same kernel and file system as the underlying host machine.

Emulators like Mininet make it possible to package up experiments and run them on different machines. This is a key benefit.c. Running real software on emulated nodes is a key advantage of emulation over simulation. It allows testing real implementations.d. Emulation is not necessarily easier to debug than simulation. Debugging real software can be quite complex.e. Emulation does not guarantee deterministic, reproducible results like simulation can. Real software may have non-deterministic behavior.Therefore, the key benefits of emulation highlighted here are the ability to package and port experiments (b) and running real software in the emulated environment (c).","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3229574', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8004460']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.95,1
