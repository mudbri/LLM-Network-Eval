179,"When APs are placed at different geographic locations, they can all be interconnected by a switched infrastructure. The 802.11 standard calls this an extended service set (ESS).","a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",,a,a,,"The statement is true. In an extended service set (ESS), multiple access points are interconnected through a switched infrastructure, typically a wired LAN. This allows the access points to be placed at different physical locations while still being part of the same logical network. Mobile devices can roam between the access points in an ESS while maintaining a continuous connection to the network. The ESS is defined in the IEEE 802.11 wireless networking standards.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_service_set', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/8-5/Enterprise-Mobility-8-5-Design-Guide/Enterprise_Mobility_8-5_Deployment_Guide/WirelessNetwork.html']",1,chapter10_wireless_networks,1,1
180,A lightweight access point in which one of the following architectures participate?,"a. Light-MAC
b. Tunnel-MAC
c. Big-MAC
d. Split-MAC
",,d,d,,"A lightweight access point participates in the split-MAC architecture. In a split-MAC architecture, the MAC functionality is split between the access point and a central controller. The access point handles time-critical functions like frame exchange and acknowledgment, while non-real-time functions like management and configuration are handled by the controller. This allows for centralized management and control of multiple lightweight access points.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_LAN_controller', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/technotes/8-3/b_SD_Access_Wireless_Deployment_Guide/b_SD_Access_Wireless_Deployment_Guide_chapter_01.html']",1,chapter10_wireless_networks,0.9,1

b. Distribution system port
c. Redundancy port
d. Console port
",,c,c,,"The redundancy port on a controller is used to connect to a peer controller for high availability (HA) operation. This port allows the controllers to synchronize their configuration and state information so that if one controller fails, the other can take over seamlessly. The service port is used for out-of-band management, the distribution system port connects to the wired network, and the console port is used for CLI access, but none of these are used specifically for HA peer connections.",['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/technotes/8-8/b_SD_Access_Wireless_Deployment_Guide.html'],1,chapter10_wireless_networks,0.95,1
182,Which of the following wireless security tools is used to protect the integrity of data in a wireless frame?,"a. MIC
b. WIPS
c. WEP
d. EAP
",,a,a,,MIC (Message Integrity Check) is the correct answer. MIC is a security tool used in wireless networks to protect the integrity of data in a wireless frame. It is a hash value calculated over the data payload and portions of the frame header. The receiving device recalculates the MIC and compares it with the MIC in the frame to verify the data has not been altered in transit. WIPS (Wireless Intrusion Prevention System) is used for wireless threat detection and prevention but does not directly protect data integrity. WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) and EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) are used for wireless authentication and encryption but not specifically for data integrity checks.,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11i-2004', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless-mobility/wireless-lan-wlan/68005-wlan-security.html']",1,chapter10_wireless_networks,0.95,1

b. Workgroup bridge
c. Transparent bridge
d. Adaptive bridge
",,b,b,,"A workgroup bridge is the correct answer. A workgroup bridge connects a wired network device, such as a printer, to a wireless network. It acts as a client to a wireless access point or router, allowing the connected wired device to communicate wirelessly. The other options are not specifically designed for this purpose: a wireless repeater extends wireless coverage by relaying signals between wireless clients and an access point; a transparent bridge connects two network segments at the data link layer; and an adaptive bridge is not a commonly used term in this context.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_bridge', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/wireless/aironet-1300-series/product_data_sheet09186a00801f7d0b.html']",1,chapter10_wireless_networks,0.9,1
185,Which controller interface type maps a WLAN to a VLAN?,"a. Management interface
b. Redundancy management
c. Virtual interface
d. Service port interface
e. Dynamic interface
",,e,e,,A dynamic interface on a wireless LAN controller maps a WLAN to a VLAN. It is used to route between the wireless clients on a WLAN and the wired network. The management interface is used for out-of-band management of the controller. Redundancy management interfaces are used for communication between active and standby controllers in a high availability setup. The virtual interface is the default gateway for wireless clients. The service port interface is used for out-of-band management on some controller models. So the dynamic interface is the only option that actually maps WLANs to VLANs.,"['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/8-5/config-guide/b_cg85/wlan_interfaces.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless/4100-series-wireless-lan-controllers/113606-cuwn-interfaces-00.html']",1,chapter10_wireless_networks,0.95,1

HTTPS provides encryption for the communication between the client and the WLC, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the configuration data being transmitted.
