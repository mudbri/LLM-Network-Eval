c. static PAT
d. policy NAT
e. dynamic NAT
",,d,d,,"Policy NAT (also known as Policy-Based NAT) allows a firewall to selectively perform address translation based on the destination IP address. It provides granular control over address translations by defining policies that match specific criteria such as source and destination addresses, ports, and protocols.

The other options are different types of attacks, but they don't necessarily hide the attacker's location like using CnC malware does.","['https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/command-and-control-server', 'https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/botnet-ddos/']",1,NetSec,0.95,1
32,Which TCP/IP application protocol can be used in an amplification attack by exploiting the protocol weakness in recursive lookup? Select one choice.,"a. HTTPS
b. LDAP
c. HTTP
d. DNS
e. SMTP
",,d,d,,"The Domain Name System (DNS) protocol can be exploited in an amplification attack by abusing its recursive lookup functionality. In a DNS amplification attack, the attacker sends DNS lookup requests to open DNS resolvers with the source address spoofed to be the target's address. When many DNS servers receive these spoofed requests, they send their responses to the target, overwhelming the target with a flood of traffic. The other protocols listed (HTTPS, LDAP, HTTP, SMTP) do not have an inherent recursive lookup mechanism that can be similarly exploited for amplification attacks.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/dns-amplification-ddos-attack/', 'https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-088A']",1,NetSec,0.95,1

b. Land attack
c. Amplification attack
d. Reflection attack
",,b,b,,"A Land attack is a type of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack where an attacker sends a SYN packet to a target machine, with the source IP address spoofed to be the same as the target machine's IP address. The SYN packet is also crafted to target the same port on the victim machine from which it supposedly originated. This causes the target machine to reply to itself, creating an infinite loop between the target computer and itself, consuming network bandwidth and resources. The other attack types mentioned (Smurf, Amplification, Reflection) are different forms of DoS attacks that do not match this specific attack pattern of a victim replying to itself on the same port.","['https://www.imperva.com/learn/ddos/land-attack/', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/land-attack/']",1,NetSec,0.95,1

b. DHCP attack
c. NetBios attack
d. SSID attack
",,a,a,,"A Layer 2 redirect or spoofing attack is commonly referred to as an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) attack or ARP spoofing. In an ARP attack, the attacker sends falsified ARP messages over a local area network, binding the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate host. This fools the other hosts on the network into sending frames intended for that IP address to the attacker instead of the legitimate host. The other choices are not directly related to Layer 2 redirect or spoofing attacks - DHCP and NetBIOS operate at higher layers, and SSID is a wireless network identifier.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing', 'https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/arp-spoofing/']",1,NetSec,0.95,1

",,b,b,,"In the context of a DHCP server-based attack, a rogue DHCP server is an illegitimate DHCP server set up by an attacker.

c. DHCP snooping
d. DHCP authentication""
",,c,c,,"DHCP snooping is a security feature on Cisco switches that can be used to mitigate DHCP attacks. DHCP snooping filters messages between DHCP clients and DHCP servers, allowing the switch to distinguish between untrusted interfaces connected to end users and trusted interfaces connected to the DHCP server or another switch. The switch builds a DHCP snooping binding database containing information such as the MAC address, IP address, lease time, binding type, and VLAN number of each host. This allows the switch to permit valid DHCP messages and drop rogue DHCP server messages, preventing DHCP spoofing attacks.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12-2SX/configuration/guide/book/snoodhcp.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst9300/software/release/16-12/configuration_guide/sec/b_1612_sec_9300_cg/configuring_dhcp.html']",1,NetSec,0.95,1
