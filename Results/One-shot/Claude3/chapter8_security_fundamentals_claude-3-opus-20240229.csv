137,"In a spoofing attack, which of the following parameters are commonly spoofed? (Choose two answers)","a. Source IP address
b. MAC address
c. ARP address
d. Routing table
e. Destination IP address
f. ARP table
",,"a,b","a,b",,"In a spoofing attack, the two most commonly spoofed parameters are:a. Source IP address: By forging the source IP address in packets, an attacker can make it appear as if the packets are originating from a trusted source, hiding their real identity. This is known as IP spoofing.b. MAC address: Attackers can change the MAC address of their device to impersonate another device on the network. This is called MAC spoofing and can be used to bypass access control lists or steal traffic intended for the legitimate device.The other options are not typically spoofed in this type of attack. The ARP address and ARP table are used in Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) to map IP addresses to MAC addresses, but are not directly spoofed. The routing table and destination IP address are also not usually targets for spoofing, as the attacker's goal is usually to disguise the source rather than the destination of malicious traffic.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoofing_attack', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/what-is-spoofing.html']",1,chapter8_security_fundamentals,0.95,1
