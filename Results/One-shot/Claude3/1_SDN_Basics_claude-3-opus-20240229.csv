1,Which of the following are true about Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)? Select all that apply.,"a. The only sizes for an IP address allocation before CIDR were 8, 16, or 24 bits.
b. The prefix length for a CIDR prefix can be anywhere in the range from 0 to 32 bits.
c. In an Internet forwarding table with CIDR, there can only be one unique matching entry for any given IP address.
d. CIDR slowed the rate of Internet routing table growth because prefixes no longer had to be allocated in fixed-size blocks.
",,"b,d","b,d",,"a. This is incorrect. Before CIDR, IP address allocations were in blocks of 8 bits (Class A), 16 bits (Class B), or 24 bits (Class C), but there was also the option of 0 bits which represented the entire IP address space.b. This is correct. CIDR allows for variable-length subnet masking (VLSM), meaning the network prefix can be anywhere from 0 to 32 bits, allowing for more flexible allocation of IP addresses.c. This is incorrect. With CIDR, a given IP address can match multiple entries in the forwarding table. The most specific (longest) matching prefix is used for forwarding.d. This is correct. By allowing variable-length prefixes, CIDR enabled more efficient allocation of IP address blocks, which helped slow the growth of Internet routing tables compared to the previous classful addressing system.Therefore, the correct answers are options b and d.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
2,Which of the following are true about how DNS lookups work? Select all that apply.,"a. A DNS A-record query for google.com will only return a single IP address at a time.
b. An NS-record query for a DNS lookup will return the name(s) of the authoritative name server(s) for that domain.
c. If your local DNS resolver caches an NS record for google.com for multiple days, all clients who use that DNS resolver will continue using the same IP address to reach Google’s Web server until that NS record expires.
d. An MX-record query for a DNS lookup will return the IP address of the mail server for that domain.
e. All DNS PTR records are maintained by a single organization in-addr.arpa.
",,b,b,,"a. A DNS A-record query can return multiple IP addresses for a domain to enable load balancing and redundancy.b. An NS-record query returns the authoritative name server(s) for the queried domain, which is correct.  c. NS records contain the authoritative name servers, not the IP address. The IP address would be in the A record, which has a separate TTL from the NS record.d. An MX-record query returns the hostname of the mail server, not the IP address directly. A separate A-record lookup would be needed for the IP.e. The in-addr.arpa domain is delegated to the organizations that own the IP address blocks. It is not maintained by a single central organization.Therefore, only option b is correct about how DNS lookups work.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types', 'https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
3,Which of the following are true about traffic control with BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
b. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
c. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
d. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
",,"a,b","a,c",,"a. This is correct. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to prefer certain outbound paths from their AS to a destination over others.b. This is incorrect. BGP AS path prepending is used to make certain paths appear less attractive to influence inbound traffic to an AS, not outbound traffic from the AS.c. This is correct. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending on outbound advertisements to make certain outbound paths appear longer and less preferred, thereby influencing outbound path selection.  d. This is incorrect. The BGP local preference attribute influences outbound traffic from an AS, not inbound traffic to an AS.Therefore, the correct answers are options a and c, which describe ways a network operator can use BGP attributes to influence outbound traffic from their AS to a destination.","['https://www.noction.com/blog/bgp-local-preference', 'https://www.noction.com/blog/bgp-as-path-prepending']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
4,Which of the following are true about layering? Select all that apply.,"a. The network layer guarantees reliable, in-order delivery of packets.
b. The network layer has only a single protocol in widespread use today, representing what we call the “narrow waist”.
c. The transport layer uses port numbers.
d. The destination address in the link layer header is always the address of the next layer-3 node along an end-to-end IP path.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"a. The network layer does not guarantee reliable, in-order delivery. That is the responsibility of the transport layer if desired (e.g., TCP). The network layer provides best-effort delivery.b. The Internet Protocol (IP) is the single protocol at the network layer that represents the 'narrow waist' of the Internet architecture. Nearly all applications and transport protocols run over IP.c. The transport layer uses port numbers to multiplex and demultiplex data streams to/from applications.d. The link layer destination address is the address of the next layer-2 node, not necessarily the next layer-3 node. Layer-2 switches forward based on layer-2 addresses and do not process layer-3 headers.Therefore, only statements b and c are true about layering in the Internet architecture.","['https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~campbell/cs60/lecture17.html', 'https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computers-and-internet/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:the-internet/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:the-internet-protocol-suite/a/the-internet-protocols']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
5,Which of the following are not true about packet switching? Select all that apply.,"a. Once a connection is established between two endpoints in a packet switched network, the end-to-end route cannot change, or the connection must be re-established.
b. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will always experience predictable latency.
c. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will never be dropped by intermediate nodes along the path.
d. A user of a packet switched network might occasionally get a “busy signal” if there are too many users on the network.
",,"a,b,c,d","a,b,c,d",,"a. In a packet-switched network, each packet is independently routed, so the path between endpoints can change without re-establishing the connection.b. Due to the dynamic nature of packet switching, latency can vary depending on network conditions and the paths taken by individual packets.c. Packets can be dropped by intermediate nodes due to congestion, errors, or other network issues.d. Packet-switched networks do not have the concept of a busy signal like circuit-switched networks. If the network is congested, packets may be delayed or dropped, but users will not receive a busy signal.Therefore, all the given statements are not true about packet switching.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching', 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/packet-switching-in-computer-network/']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
6,Which of the following are true about content distribution networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Content distribution networks can improve the performance that a client sees by reducing the network latency between the client and the content that it is downloading.
b. Content distribution networks can reduce transit expenses for a content provider by enabling much of the provider’s content to be served from a nearby network, sometimes even from a cache that is within the client’s own network.
c. Real-time content such as video streams cannot be distributed from a content distribution network.
d. Content distribution networks typically redirect Web clients to a nearby Web cache by rewriting the IP address of packets sent from the client to the IP address of the nearby Web cache.
",,"a,b","a,b",,"a. This is true. By serving content from servers geographically closer to the client, CDNs can reduce network latency and improve performance for the client.b. This is also true. CDNs allow content providers to serve content from caches in networks closer to the client, reducing the amount of transit traffic the content provider needs to pay for.  c. This is false. CDNs are commonly used to distribute real-time content like video streams. Techniques like chunking the video allow it to be served from CDN caches.d. This is false. CDNs typically redirect clients by rewriting DNS responses to return the IP address of a nearby cache server, not by rewriting IP addresses in packets.","['https://www.akamai.com/our-thinking/cdn/what-is-a-cdn', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
7,Which of the following are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control? Select all that apply.,"a. Only wireless networks can have collisions at the receiver; such collisions are not possible on wired Ethernet networks.
b. Using RTS/CTS (“request to send”, “clear to send”) control reduces the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network.
c. A wireless sender can avoid causing a collision at the receiver by performing a “carrier sense” to determine whether any other sender wants to transmit at the time that it wishes to send a packet.
d. Disabling RTS/CTS necessarily lowers the effective throughput of the wireless network, since more collisions will occur at the receiver without RTS/CTS enabled.
",,b,"b,c",,"a. This statement is false. Collisions can occur at the receiver in both wireless and wired Ethernet networks when multiple senders transmit at the same time.b. This statement is true. Using RTS/CTS control frames introduces additional overhead, which can reduce the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network.c. This statement is true. Wireless senders can perform carrier sensing to determine if the channel is idle before transmitting, which helps avoid causing collisions at the receiver.d. This statement is false. While disabling RTS/CTS may lead to more collisions in certain scenarios, it does not necessarily lower the effective throughput. In fact, disabling RTS/CTS can improve throughput by reducing the overhead associated with these control frames, especially when the network primarily consists of small packets.Therefore, the correct answers are options b and c.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11_RTS/CTS', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/carrier-sense-multiple-access']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,1
8,Which of the following are true about video streaming? Select all that apply.,"a. Using UDP to stream a video instead of TCP is appropriate if the client is more concerned about low delay and interactivity than it does about receiving a high-quality stream.
b. A larger playout buffer at the client allows the client more time to recover from lost packets.
c. Using TCP for video streaming could result in larger delays between transmission and playout than streaming the same video with UDP.
d. Since UDP provides no reliable delivery guarantees, a video streaming application that uses UDP as its transport cannot recover from any packet loss in the video stream.
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"a. This is true. UDP provides lower delay and more interactivity compared to TCP, at the cost of potential packet loss and lower quality. If low delay is the priority, UDP is appropriate.b. This is true. A larger playout buffer gives the client more time to request and receive retransmissions of lost packets before the video needs to be played out. c. This is true. TCP's reliable in-order delivery can introduce delays due to retransmissions and head-of-line blocking that UDP would avoid. UDP's lack of reliability mechanisms results in lower delay.d. This is false. While UDP itself provides no reliability, a video streaming application built on UDP can implement its own mechanisms like retransmission requests, forward error correction, etc. to recover from some degree of packet loss.Therefore, statements a, b and c are true about video streaming, while d is false.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition, by Kurose and Ross, Section 7.3', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOWcn6fWJnM']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
9,Which of the following are true about TCP? Select all that apply.,"a. TCP guarantees that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted.
b. A TCP sender and receiver use a “three-way handshake” both to set up and to terminate the TCP connection.
c. TCP’s congestion avoidance algorithm causes the sender to reduce its sending rate by a factor of two when it sees a packet loss.
d. A TCP sender controls its sending rate by adjusting the number of unacknowledged packets that can be sent over the network at any time.
",,"a,c,d","a,d",,"a. This is true. TCP provides reliable, in-order delivery of a stream of bytes from sender to receiver.b. This is partially false. TCP uses a three-way handshake to establish a connection, but terminating a connection uses a four-way handshake.  c. This is false. TCP's congestion avoidance algorithm additively increases the congestion window until packet loss, at which point it multiplicatively decreases the window by a factor of 2.d. This is true. TCP uses a sliding window protocol where the sender's window size is the number of unacknowledged packets that can be in flight. The sender adjusts this window to control its rate.Therefore, the correct answers are options a and d.","['https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol', 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-3-way-handshake-process/', 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-connection-termination/']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
10,Which of the following are true about denial of service attacks (and defenses)? Select all that apply.,"a. If every network on the Internet performed stateless ingress filtering to defend against source IP spoofing, the DNS reflection attack would not work.
b. If every network on the Internet performed stateless egress filtering to defend against source IP address spoofing, the DNS reflection attack could not be carried out.
c. In a “SYN Flood” attack, each TCP SYN packet that a victim receives causes it to set up TCP connection state.
d. A “DNS Reflection” attack requires the attacking client to “spoof” the source IP address of the packet containing the DNS request.
",,"b,c,d","b,c,d",,"a. Ingress filtering checks inbound traffic but does not prevent spoofed source IPs in outbound packets, so this alone would not prevent reflection attacks.b. If all networks performed egress filtering to block spoofed source IPs in outbound packets, attackers could not spoof the victim's IP to trigger reflected traffic, so reflection attacks would fail.  c. In a SYN flood, each SYN causes the server to allocate connection state and resources, potentially exhausting its capacity if flooded.d. DNS reflection requires the attacker to spoof the source IP of the DNS query to be the victim's IP, so the DNS responses are reflected to the victim.Therefore, the correct answers are options b, c, and d.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/dns-amplification-ddos-attack/', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/syn-flood-ddos-attack/', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/press/internet-protocol-journal/back-issues/table-contents-34/syn-flooding-attacks.html']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
