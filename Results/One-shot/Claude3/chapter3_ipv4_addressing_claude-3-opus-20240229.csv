c. To reserve addresses for the subnet broadcast address and subnet ID

",,c,c,,"The formula for the number of usable hosts per subnet, 2^H - 2, reserves two addresses because each subnet needs one subnet ID (network address) and one subnet broadcast address. These two special addresses cannot be assigned to hosts, so they are subtracted from the total number of addresses in the subnet (2^H). The all-0s host address is the subnet ID, and the all-1s host address is the subnet broadcast address. The default gateway (router) address is a usable host address within the subnet range and does not need to be specifically reserved. DHCP is an application layer protocol that dynamically assigns IP addresses from the pool of valid host addresses, so it also does not require reserved addresses.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html']",1,chapter3_ipv4_addressing,0.95,1
