221,A Layer 2 switch examines a frame’s destination MAC address and forwards that frame out of the port G0/2. That action occurs as part of which plane of the switch?,"a. Data plane
b. Management plane
c. Control Plane
d. None of the above
",,a,a,,"The data plane is responsible for forwarding frames based on the destination MAC address. When a switch receives a frame, it looks up the destination MAC address in its MAC address table to determine which port to forward the frame out of. This process of examining the frame's destination MAC address and making a forwarding decision occurs in the data plane of the switch. The management plane is used for managing the switch, such as configuring VLANs or setting up access control lists, while the control plane is responsible for building the MAC address table and running protocols like Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). Therefore, the action of examining a frame's destination MAC address and forwarding it out of a specific port is part of the data plane.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch#Layer_2', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst9300/software/release/16-12/configuration_guide/lyr2/b_1612_lyr2_9300_cg/configuring_ethernet_switching.html']",1,chapter13_network_automation,0.95,1

228,"Your company decides to move away from manual configuration methods, making changes by editing centralized configuration files. The issues you are facing with non-centralized configuration files are:
1) You don’t know who engineer made the changes in the configuration file.
2) You don’t know the changes in the configuration file over time.
Which tool your company will use in order to solve these issues?","a. Version Control System
b. Version Control Configuration
c. Version Control Change
d. Version Control Edit
",,a,a,,"A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that helps manage changes to files over time. It tracks who made the changes, when they were made, and what specifically was changed. This allows teams to collaborate on files, revert to previous versions if needed, and understand the evolution of the files. In the context of network configuration files, using a VCS would address the issues of not knowing who made changes and not having visibility into how the files changed over time.

229,"One of the benefits of controller-based networks over traditional networks is that the configuration on the devices have fewer errors, and you spent less time troubleshooting the network.","a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",,a,a,,"The statement is true. In a controller-based network, such as those using Software Defined Networking (SDN), the control plane is decoupled from the data plane. This means that the network devices (switches, routers) are controlled by a centralized controller that manages the network configuration and policies. The controller has a global view of the network and can enforce consistent configurations across all devices. This centralized management reduces the likelihood of configuration errors that can occur when manually configuring each device individually, as is the case in traditional networks. As a result, network administrators spend less time troubleshooting misconfigurations and inconsistencies in the network.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/software-defined-networking/overview.html']",1,chapter13_network_automation,0.95,1
