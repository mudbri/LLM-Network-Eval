25,What could be the operational steps behind the AT&T's IRSCP (a commercial version of the Routing Control Platform) for detecting malicious traffic? Select all that apply.,"a. The controller sees all traffic passing through the network, detects an attack, and installs a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where the attack traffic is originating.
b. The end host changes its IP address so that it is no longer the target of the attack traffic.
c. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to re-route traffic through a deep-packet inspection device.
d. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to install a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where attack traffic is originating.
e. A victim end host sends an alert to an on-path firewall about the source and nature of an attack, at which point the firewall installs a null route to drop the traffic at the entry point where the attack is originating.
",,"c,d","c,d",,"The operational steps for detecting and mitigating malicious traffic in AT&T's IRSCP likely involve:c. A measurement system detecting an attack, identifying the entry point, and instructing the controller to reroute the traffic through a deep packet inspection device for further analysis and filtering.d. A measurement system detecting an attack, identifying the entry point, and instructing the controller to install a null route at that entry point to drop the attack traffic.The other options are less likely:a. The controller seeing all traffic is inefficient and not scalable. b. The end host changing its IP doesn't mitigate the attack at the source.e. The end host sending an alert to an on-path firewall is a manual process and doesn't leverage the SDN controller.Therefore, options c and d are the most probable operational steps for IRSCP's malicious traffic detection and mitigation.","['https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/papers/4d09.pdf', 'https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/hotice07/tech/full_papers/caesar/caesar.pdf']",1,4_control_and_data_separation,0.8,1
26,What are some example network management applications that become easier with control and data plane separation? Select all that apply.,"a. Improved interdomain routing security.
b. Customer-controlled egress selection.
c. Improved logging capabilities.
d. Planned maintenance of an edge router.
e. Forecasting of network capacity.
",,"a,b,d","a,b,d",,"a. Separating the control and data planes can improve interdomain routing security by allowing the control plane to validate routes before installing them in the data plane.b. Customers can more easily control egress selection if the control plane is separate from the data plane and exposes an API for egress control.c. Logging capabilities are not necessarily improved by separating the control and data planes.d. Planned maintenance of an edge router is easier if its control plane can be migrated to a different device while the data plane continues to forward traffic.e. Forecasting network capacity is not necessarily made easier by separating the control and data planes.Therefore, the network management applications that become easier with control and data plane separation are options a, b, and d.","['https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/nsdi05/tech/full_papers/caesar/caesar.pdf', 'https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/papers/4d09.pdf']",1,4_control_and_data_separation,0.9,1
27,What are some of the motivations for using Layer-2 forwarding in a data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Ability to use existing routing protocols to establish paths between hosts.
b. Easier configuration/administration, since there is no need to number hosts or configure subnets.
c. Better security properties.
d. Better scaling properties.
e. Better load balancing properties.
",,b,"b,c",,"The main motivations for using Layer-2 forwarding in a data center are:b. Easier configuration and administration, since there is no need to assign IP addresses to hosts or configure IP subnets. With Layer-2 forwarding, hosts can be assigned MAC addresses which are self-configured.c. Better security properties compared to Layer-3 IP forwarding. With Layer-2, it is easier to isolate different tenants' traffic from each other. Also, MAC addresses are more difficult to spoof than IP addresses.The other options are not strong motivations for Layer-2 forwarding:a. Existing routing protocols are not used with Layer-2 forwarding. Spanning tree or other Layer-2 specific protocols are used instead.d. Layer-2 forwarding does not have better scaling properties than Layer-3 IP forwarding. In fact, Layer-2 networks can have scaling challenges due to issues like broadcast storms and large MAC address tables.e. Load balancing is not necessarily better with Layer-2 forwarding. Both Layer-2 and Layer-3 allow for load balancing techniques like Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) forwarding.","['https://www.networkworld.com/article/2226122/layer-2-vs--layer-3-switches-explained.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-7000-series-switches/white_paper_c11-622511.html']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.9,1
28,How does the separation of the control and data plane make networking in data centers easier?,"a. Virtual machines can be migrated within the network without renumbering entire portions of the network or re-assigning network services to different IP addresses.
b. The control plane allows traffic to be forwarded using Layer 2 addresses, thus allowing automatic load balance across the topology.
c. The separation allows fewer switches to be used in the data center topology, thus lowering costs.
d. All routes can be controlled and monitored from a central point of control.
e. A network controller can permit the renumbering of end hosts to have topology-dependent Layer 2 MAC addresses.
",,"a,d,e","a,d",,The separation of control and data planes in data center networking provides the following benefits:a. Virtual machine migration becomes easier because the control plane can manage the network configuration centrally. VMs can be moved without needing to renumber IP addresses or re-assign services.d. Centralized control allows all routes to be managed and monitored from a single point. The controller has a global network view and can make optimized routing decisions.b is incorrect because using Layer 2 addressing alone does not enable automatic load balancing. That requires additional mechanisms.c is incorrect as separating control and data planes does not inherently reduce the number of switches needed. e is incorrect because hosts are not typically renumbered with topology-dependent Layer 2 addresses in SDN deployments.,"['https://www.networkworld.com/article/3209131/what-sdn-is-and-where-its-going.html', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-the-definition-of-software-defined-networking-sdn/']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.9,1
29,"What are some examples of problems that can arise from consistency problems in the control plane, where a network has multiple controller replicas?","a. A flood of traffic at the controller.
b. Inability to respond to link failures.
c. Incorrect security policies.
d. Incorrect operation when one controller fails.
e. Forwarding loops.
",,"c,e","b,c,d,e",,"a. A flood of traffic at the controller is not directly caused by consistency issues between controller replicas. It could be caused by other factors like DoS attacks or misconfiguration.b. If controller replicas have inconsistent network state, they may compute inconsistent paths. This could lead to inability to respond correctly to link failures.c. Inconsistency between controller replicas could lead to security policies being enforced differently at different switches, leading to incorrect security.d. If controller replicas are inconsistent and one fails, the remaining replicas may not have a consistent network view, leading to incorrect operation.e. Inconsistent controller state can lead to switches installing inconsistent forwarding rules which can cause forwarding loops in the data plane.Therefore, options b, c, d, and e are all valid problems that can arise from control plane consistency issues in a multi-controller SDN setup.","['https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7524380', 'https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi13/nsdi13-final232.pdf']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.95,1
30,What are some approaches to coping with inconsistency across controller replicas? Select all that apply.,"a. Running a consistency protocol across controller replicas.
b. Keeping a ""hot spare"" replica that has a complete view of the network state.
c. Only keeping a subset of the network state in memory at any time.
d. Using different controllers for independent parts of the network.
e. Having multiple controllers install forwarding table entries on the same router and resolving the conflict on the router itself.
",,"a,b,c,d","a,d",,"a. Running a consistency protocol across controller replicas can help ensure that all replicas eventually converge to the same network state. This is a common approach in distributed systems to maintain consistency.b. Keeping a hot spare does not directly address consistency across active replicas. The spare would need to be kept in sync as well.c. Only keeping a subset of state does not ensure the replicas are consistent with each other for the state they do maintain. d. Using different controllers for independent network segments can avoid inconsistency by partitioning the state each controller is responsible for. As long as controllers don't share responsibility for the same network elements, consistency is not an issue.e. Having multiple controllers compete to install entries on the same router can lead to correctness issues if the controllers are not carefully coordinated. The router would not know which controller's state to use.Therefore, the two valid approaches listed are running a consistency protocol across replicas and partitioning responsibility between independent controllers.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2486001.2486011', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6733615']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.9,1
31,What are some approaches to coping with scalability challenges associated with control and data plane separation? Select all that apply.,"a. Caching forwarding decisions in the data plane to reduce traffic at the controller.
b. Only performing control-plane operations for a limited set of network operations.
c. Eliminating redundant data structures.
d. Sending all traffic through the controller to minimize forwarding decisions that the routers and switches must make.
e. Running multiple controllers, and having each controller only manage a part of the network.
",,"a,b,c,e","a,b,e",,"a. Caching forwarding decisions in the data plane can reduce the number of requests the data plane elements need to send to the controller, improving scalability.b. Limiting the types of operations that require control plane involvement can reduce the load on the controller and improve scalability. c. While eliminating redundant data structures can improve efficiency, it is not directly related to the challenges of control and data plane separation.d. Sending all traffic through the controller would actually worsen scalability by creating a bottleneck at the controller. The goal is to minimize the load on the controller.e. Distributing the control plane across multiple controllers, each responsible for a portion of the network, can improve scalability by sharing the load.Therefore, the correct answers are options a, b, and e, which are all valid approaches to improving control plane scalability in software-defined networks.","['https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi15/nsdi15-paper-koponen.pdf', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7980042']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.95,1
32,"Which property guarantees that each RCP replica continues to install correct forwarding state in the network data plane, even in the case of a partition in the data plane?","a. Each controller has a complete view of the portion of the network that it is controlling, and therefore can guarantee consistent routing within that partition.
b. The controller cannot see many of the routers in the network anyway, so there is no way for it to install incorrect routing state in the routers that it is not connected to.
c. The controllers are partitioned from the network routers, and the routers will fall back to running a distributed routing protocol.
d. Running the network from a single high-level control plane guarantees that network partitions and loops never occur in the first place.
",,a,a,,"Each RCP controller maintains a complete view of the portion of the network it is controlling. Therefore, even if there is a partition in the data plane that separates the controllers, each controller can still compute and install correct forwarding state for its partition of the network. The controller does not need visibility into the other partitions to guarantee consistent routing within its own partition.The other options are incorrect:b. The controller needs to see the routers it is controlling to install correct routing state. c. The question states the controllers are partitioned from each other, not necessarily from the routers. And relying on the routers to fall back to distributed routing does not guarantee the property in question.d. Network partitions can still occur even with a logically centralized control plane. The control plane itself needs to handle partitions correctly.",['https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/papers/RCP.pdf'],1,4_control_and_data_separation,0.9,1
