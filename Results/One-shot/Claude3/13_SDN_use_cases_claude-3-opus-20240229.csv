95,What are some benefits to using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Host configuration is simpler, since all hosts are visible from a single large Ethernet topology.
b. Forwarding on physical MAC addresses is simpler, since both the data center network topology and hosts' physical MAC addresses are hierarchical.
c. IP routing does not need to be reconfigured when physical or virtual machines move from one part of the network to another.
d. Scaling problems are simpler, since all hosts are configured on a single, flat topology.
e. Load balancing is easier on a layer-2 topology than on a layer 3 topology.
",,"a,c","a,c",,"a. Having all hosts on a single layer-2 topology does simplify host configuration since they are all on the same broadcast domain and subnet. No routing is needed between hosts.b. MAC addresses are flat, not hierarchical, so this statement is incorrect. c. Since all hosts are on the same layer-2 domain, their IP addresses do not need to change when they move within the data center. The network will update the MAC address table to reflect the new location.d. Having all hosts on a single flat layer-2 topology actually makes scaling harder. Broadcast traffic needs to reach all hosts which limits scalability. Segmenting the network helps contain broadcast domains.e. Load balancing can be done at either layer-2 or layer-3. The network layer used does not inherently make load balancing easier or harder.Therefore, only statements a and c are benefits of using a layer-2 topology across an entire data center.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-7000-series-switches/white_paper_c11-622479.html', 'https://www.networkworld.com/article/2226122/layer-2-vs--layer-3-switches-explained.html']",1,13_SDN_use_cases,0.95,1
96,"In PortLand, what are the reasons for assigning hosts pseudo-MAC addresses, as opposed to simply forwarding traffic on physical MAC addresses? Select all that apply.","a. Hosts in the data-center network topology are more vulnerable to attack if they expose their actual physical MAC addresses, rather than having a layer of indirection.
b. It is very difficult to load balance traffic using physical MAC addresses; pseudo MAC addresses make it possible to assign traffic to destination IP addresses.
c. Without pseudo-MAC addresses, switches would have to update forwarding state whenever hosts with a particular MAC address moved from one portion of the topology to another.
d. Forwarding loops are be more common in a flat layer-2 topology than they are in a topology with hierarchical pseudo MAC addresses.
e. In a flat layer-2 topology, switches cannot know on which port to forward traffic without maintaining switch tables for each MAC address, since MAC addresses are flat, not hierarchical.
",,"c,e","c,e",,"a. Security is not the primary motivation for pseudo-MAC addresses in PortLand.b. Load balancing is not the primary motivation for pseudo-MAC addresses in PortLand. c. Correct. Without pseudo-MAC addresses that encode location information, switches would need to update forwarding entries whenever a host moves, to ensure that traffic is forwarded out the correct port.d. Forwarding loops are not the primary concern being addressed by pseudo-MAC addresses in PortLand.e. Correct. In a flat layer-2 topology with regular MAC addresses, switches would need to maintain a large forwarding table to map each flat MAC address to an outgoing port. Pseudo-MAC addresses encode the location, making forwarding tables much smaller.Therefore, the correct answers are options c and e, which highlight the main reasons PortLand uses pseudo-MAC addresses: to avoid updating forwarding state when hosts move, and to allow compact forwarding tables by encoding location information.",['https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/nsdi09/tech/full_papers/mysore/mysore.pdf'],1,13_SDN_use_cases,0.95,1
97,What are the steps involved in the Proxy ARP process that PortLand's Fabric Manager runs?,"a. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns returns PMAC directly to the end host.
b. Edge switch sends ARP query to fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch updates its local PMAC mapping table.
c. Host sends ARP query, fabric manager intercepts ARP query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to end host.
d. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to the host.
e. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch returns PMAC to end host.
",,e,e,,"The correct steps for the Proxy ARP process in PortLand's Fabric Manager are:1. The host sends an ARP query to resolve the IP address to a MAC address. 2. The edge switch intercepts this ARP query.3. The edge switch redirects the ARP query to the fabric manager.4. The fabric manager consults its PMAC mapping table to find the corresponding PMAC address for the IP.5. The fabric manager returns the PMAC address to the edge switch.6. The edge switch then returns this PMAC to the end host that originated the ARP query.Therefore, option e correctly captures all the steps in the right order.",['https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/nsdi09/tech/full_papers/mysore/mysore_html/index.html'],1,13_SDN_use_cases,0.95,1
98,"What are some of the disadvantages of today's interdomain routing protocol, BGP? Select all that apply.","a. ISPs cannot load-balance traffic across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix.
b. Routing and forwarding decisions are only based on IP prefix, not on a broader range of traffic flow attributes.
c. ISPs can only influence route selection through indirect mechanisms (e.g., prepending), rather than directly manipulating the forwarding table entries in switches.
d. ISPs cannot express preference of one route over another, given multiple routes to a destination.
e. ISPs can only influence the routing decisions of their immediate neighbor, not the entire end-to-end path.
",,"b,c,e","b,c,e",,"a. BGP allows ISPs to load-balance traffic across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix using techniques like equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) routing. This is not a disadvantage of BGP.b. BGP routing decisions are indeed only based on IP prefix. It does not consider other attributes of the traffic flow. This limits the flexibility and control over routing.c. In BGP, ISPs can only indirectly influence route selection by techniques like AS path prepending, rather than directly manipulating the forwarding entries. They have to rely on their neighbors to propagate the routing information. This is a limitation of BGP's routing control.d. BGP does allow ISPs to express preference of one route over another when there are multiple routes to a destination. This can be done using mechanisms like local preference attribute. So this is not a disadvantage.e. In BGP, an ISP can only directly influence the routing decisions of its immediate neighbors by sending them route advertisements or route withdrawals. It cannot directly control the end-to-end path, which is determined by the routing decisions made by all the ASes along the way based on their local policies. This is a limitation of BGP's routing control.Therefore, the correct options that state the disadvantages of BGP are b, c, and e.","['https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall16/cos561/papers/BGPsurvey-Dec2012.pdf', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/13753-25.html']",1,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,1
101,What are some of the features that an SDX enables that today's IXPs cannot support? Select all that apply.,"a. Application of different business relationships across different regions of the world (e.g., peering only in a specific geographic region).
b. Application-specific peering
c. Wide-area load balancing using DNS-based redirection
d. On-the-fly redirection to middleboxes
e. Wide-area load balancing using IP packet rewriting
",,"b,d,e","a,b,d",,"An SDX (Software Defined Internet Exchange) enables several features that traditional IXPs cannot easily support:a. An SDX can allow participants to apply different peering policies based on geographic region. This is possible because the SDX controller has a global view and can make forwarding decisions accordingly.b. An SDX can enable application-specific peering by inspecting traffic and applying different policies based on application type. The SDX's programmability makes this feasible.c. DNS-based load balancing is not a feature specifically enabled by SDXes. It can be achieved with traditional IXP architectures.d. An SDX can dynamically redirect traffic through middleboxes like firewalls and load balancers. The SDX controller can alter forwarding paths to steer traffic as needed.e. IP packet rewriting for load balancing is also achievable without an SDX.So in summary, the SDX's programmable, software-based architecture uniquely enables features a, b and d which are difficult with legacy IXP designs.","['https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi14/nsdi14-paper-gupta.pdf', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/software-defined-internet-exchange-sdx/']",0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,1
103,What are some of the motivations for applying software defined networking in home networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Better performance, since control decisions can be made from a well-provisioned server, as opposed to an under-provisioned router.
b. Ability to better user interfaces to control home network behavior, independent of the interfaces that ship with home router devices.
c. Ability to allow multiple service providers access to the home network infrastructure for different applications and services.
d. Outsourcing control and management of the home network to a third party.
e. More fine-grained control over the forwarding behavior of individual devices as conditions in the network change (e.g., a device uses too much bandwidth or data).
",,"b,c,d,e","b,c,d,e",,"a. While SDN controllers may run on well-provisioned servers, the main motivation is not performance but flexibility and programmability.b. SDN allows developing custom user interfaces and applications to control home network behavior, independent of the stock interfaces that come with home routers. This enables innovation and customization.c. By decoupling control from the underlying devices, SDN allows multiple service providers or applications to manage different aspects of the home network in a modular way.d. SDN enables outsourcing management of the complex home network to a third-party service provider with more expertise and resources.e.

",,c,c,,"The policy has two independent parts: (1) blocking Facebook traffic from the child's computer, and (2) rate limiting the child's BitTorrent traffic if the parent's VoIP client is active.
