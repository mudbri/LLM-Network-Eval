c. show interface status
d. show status interface
",,c,"a,c",,"The commands 'show interface' and 'show interface status' are both valid commands on different network devices to check the status of the interfaces. 'show interface' typically provides detailed information about the interface, including the protocol status, link status, MAC address, and various statistics.

When you are in any of the configuration modes in a Cisco device, such as console line configuration mode, the 'end' command will take you back to the privileged EXEC mode, also known as enable mode. The 'back' command is not a recognized Cisco IOS command for exiting configuration modes. The 'enable' command is used to switch from user EXEC mode to privileged EXEC mode, but it is not used while in configuration modes to go back to enable mode.

",,c,c,,"The correct answer is C, interface configuration mode. Duplex settings for a specific interface, such as Fast Ethernet 0/2, are configured in interface configuration mode. This mode is accessed from global configuration mode by entering the command 'interface FastEthernet 0/2'. Global configuration mode (choice A) is used to enter specific configuration modes but does not directly configure interface settings.

27,"Switches use STP to prevent loops by causing some interfaces to block, meaning that they do not send or receive frames.","a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",,a,a,,"A is the correct answer. The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is used by switches to prevent loops in a network by designating some switch ports to be in a blocking state, where they do not forward frames, and others to be in a forwarding state.

28,A Layer 2 switch configuration places all its physical ports into VLAN 2. The IP addressing plan shows that address 175.28.1.150 (with mask 255.255.255.0) is reserved for use by this new LAN switch and that 175.28.1.254 is already configured on the router connected to that same VLAN. The switch needs to support SSH connections into the switch from any subnet in the network. Which of the following commands are part of the required configuration in this case? (Choose two answers.),"a. The switch cannot support SSH because all its ports connect to VLAN 2, and the IP address must be configured on interface VLAN 1.
b. The ip address 175.28.1.150 255.255.255.0 command in interface vlan 2 configuration mode.
c. The ip default-gateway 175.28.1.254 command in global configuration mode.
d. The ip address 172.16.2.250 255.255.255.0 command in interface vlan 1 configuration mode.
e. The ip default-gateway 175.28.1.150 command in global configuration mode.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"B and C are the correct answers. To support SSH connections, the switch needs an IP address and a default gateway configured. Since all the switch ports are in VLAN 2, the switch's management IP address must be in VLAN 2. Therefore, the command to assign the IP address would be applied to interface VLAN 2, which is option B. Additionally, the switch needs a default gateway to communicate with other subnets, and the IP address of the router on the same VLAN should be used as the default gateway, which is what option C states. Option A is incorrect because there is no requirement that the switch's IP address must be on VLAN 1. Option D is incorrect because it assigns an IP address to VLAN 1, which is not being used according to the scenario. Option E is incorrect because it uses the switch's own IP address as the default gateway, which is not how networking is configured.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/16448-ripng.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750/software/release/12-2_58_se/configuration/guide/scg3750/swipaddr.html#wp1107256']",1,chapter2_ethernet_lans,1,0.9997884953402649

",,a,a,,"Option A is the correct answer. The commands provided in option A are the correct sequence for setting a password on the console line of a Cisco device. The command 'line console 0' enters line configuration mode for the console port. The 'password examsdigest' command sets the password to 'examsdigest' for the console line, and the 'login' command enables password checking on login, making the password required to access the device through the console port.

",,d,d,,"D is the correct answer. To configure the password for telnet access, you need to access the vty (virtual terminal) lines configuration mode. The command 'line vty 0 15' is used to select all vty lines from 0 to 15, which is the usual range for configuring telnet or SSH access on a Cisco device. Within the vty configuration mode, you set the password with the 'password' command followed by the desired password, and then use the 'login' command to enable password checking on login. The 'end' command is used to return to privileged EXEC mode. Option A is incorrect because it configures the console line, not the vty lines. Option B is incorrect because it sets the enable secret password, which is different from the vty line password. Option C is incorrect because 'enable console' is not a valid Cisco command.",['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/access/800/819/software/configuration/Guide/819_SCG/6ser_conf.html#pgfId-1073734'],1,chapter2_ethernet_lans,1,0.9999697675220106
32,Which of the following type of memory is used to store the configuration used by the switch when it is up and running?,"a. ROM
b. RAM
c. NVRAM
d. Flash
",,b,b,,"B is the correct answer. RAM (Random Access Memory) is used by a switch to store the running configuration. When a switch is up and running, the running configuration is actively used and modified in RAM. This is volatile memory, which means that the contents are lost when the device is powered off or restarted. ROM (Read-Only Memory) is used for storing the bootloader and basic diagnostic software.
