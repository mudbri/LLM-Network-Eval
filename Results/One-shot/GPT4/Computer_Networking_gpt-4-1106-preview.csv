Infrastructure mode, on the other hand, requires devices to connect through a central access point. Mesh networking involves multiple nodes that can act as a relay for other nodes, creating a network with potentially multiple hops to reach the internet or other nodes, but it still often involves fixed points that are not necessarily peer-to-peer. Wi-Fi Direct is a technology that allows devices to connect directly to each other, but it is not the traditional term used to describe a network setup without a central access point. Therefore, the correct answer is option a.","['https://www.lifewire.com/wireless-network-modes-816563', 'https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005687/network-and-i-o/wireless.html']",1,Computer_Networking,0.95,0.9999447358231209

b. Infrastructure mode
c. Mesh networking
d. Wi-Fi Direct
",,c,c,,"Mesh networking is a type of wireless networking where multiple access points, often referred to as nodes, work together to form a single, cohesive network. In a mesh network, nodes are interconnected and can dynamically route data among themselves. This allows for coverage across a large area and provides for redundancy and improved network performance, as data can take multiple paths to reach its destination. Mesh networking is particularly useful in situations where it's not feasible to wire every access point back to a central router or switch, as in large homes, offices, or outdoor areas. Thus, option c is correct.",['https://www.linksys.com/us/r/resource-center/whole-home-mesh-wifi/'],1,Computer_Networking,0.95,0.9986282111636715
41,Which wireless technology allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network? Choose only one.,"a. Ad-hoc mode
b. Infrastructure mode
c. Mesh networking
d. Wi-Fi Direct
",,b,b,,"Infrastructure mode is the wireless networking mode that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network using a central device, typically a wireless access point (WAP) or router. The WAP connects to the wired network and communicates with the wireless devices, allowing them to access resources on the wired network. Ad-hoc mode is a peer-to-peer wireless network without a central device. Mesh networking is a network topology where each node relays data for the network and can dynamically self-organize and self-configure. Wi-Fi Direct is a standard that allows devices to connect directly to each other without the need for a wireless access point.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless-mobility/wireless-lan-wlan/116493-configure-infrastructure-wlan-00.html', 'https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24960/infrastructure-mode-wireless-networking']",1,Computer_Networking,1,0.9999543908301298
