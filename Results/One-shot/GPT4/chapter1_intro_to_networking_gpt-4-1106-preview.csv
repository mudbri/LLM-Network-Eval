1,Which of the following terms describe Ethernet addresses that can send one frame and is delivered to multiple devices on the LAN? (Choose two answers.),"a. Broadcast address
b. Multicast address
c. IP address
d. MAC address
e. Unicast address
",,"a,b","a,b",,"A and B are the correct answers. Ethernet broadcast addresses allow a frame to be sent to all devices on the local network. This is typically represented by the MAC address FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. Multicast addresses allow a frame to be delivered to a group of devices on the local network that are configured to listen for frames sent to that multicast address. An IP address can be unicast, multicast, or broadcast, but the term 'IP address' by itself does not imply that it is delivered to multiple devices. A MAC address is a unique identifier for network interfaces, and it can be a unicast (single device), multicast (multiple devices), or broadcast (all devices) address, but without specifying, it generally refers to a unicast address. Unicast addresses are intended for a single recipient.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_address', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_address']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,1,0.9999975863151829
3,___________ is a set of rules determining how network devices respond when two devices attempt to use a data channel simultaneously and encounter a data collision.,"a. CSMA/CD
b. CSMA/CA
c. TCP/IP
d. TCP/UDP
",,a,a,,"A is the correct answer. Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) is a network protocol that determines how network devices respond when two devices attempt to use a data channel simultaneously (i.e., a collision occurs). It is used in traditional Ethernet networks to manage data transmission and avoid collisions. CSMA/CA, or Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance, is used in wireless networks to prevent collisions before they happen. TCP/IP and TCP/UDP are protocols used for different purposes; TCP/IP is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet, and TCP/UDP refers to two different transport layer protocols (TCP and UDP) within the TCP/IP suite.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-sense_multiple_access_with_collision_detection', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-sense_multiple_access_with_collision_avoidance', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,1,0.9999837140256179
4,Ethernet standard ___________ BASE-T defines Gigabit Ethernet over UTP cabling.,"a. 100

c. 1000
d. 1
",,c,c,,"C is the correct answer. The Ethernet standard 1000BASE-T is defined for Gigabit Ethernet over UTP cabling. It supports a maximum length of 100 meters and uses Category 5e or higher cabling. The '1000' in 1000BASE-T indicates the speed in Mbps, which is 1000 Mbps or 1 Gbps.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabit_Ethernet', 'https://www.ieee802.org/3/ab/']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,1,0.9999883629027115
5,Which of the following IEEE 802.3 Ethernet Header and Trailer Fields allows devices on the network to easily synchronize their receiver clocks?,"a. Frame Check Sequence
b. Data and Pad
c. Start Frame Delimiter
d. Preamble
",,d,d,,"The Preamble field in the Ethernet header is used to allow devices on the network to easily synchronize their receiver clocks, providing a timing reference for the start of frame reception. It consists of a 7-byte pattern of alternating 1s and 0s that ends with two consecutive 1s, which then transitions into the Start Frame Delimiter (SFD). The Preamble is not used for error checking or data encapsulation, which is the purpose of the Frame Check Sequence (FCS). The Data and Pad fields carry the encapsulated data and any necessary padding to meet the minimum frame size.",['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame#Preamble_and_start_frame_delimiter'],1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,1,0.999852131313652
6,The host sends packets to its default gateway if the ____________ IP address is in a different subnet than the host.,"a. Source
b. Destination
c. Unicast
d. Broadcast
",,b,b,,"The correct answer is B. When a host needs to send packets to an IP address that is not in the same subnet as itself, it sends the packets to its default gateway (usually a router or a switch configured with routing capabilities). The default gateway is responsible for forwarding the packets to the destination outside of the local subnet. The source IP address refers to the IP address of the host sending the packets, which is irrelevant to the decision of whether to send the packets to the default gateway. Unicast and broadcast refer to types of network traffic, not to conditions for sending traffic to a default gateway.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_gateway', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/16448-ripng.html']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,1,0.9998114970389163
9,Which of the following protocols resides in the Application TCP/IP Architecture layer?,"a. SMTP
b. TCP
c. Ethernet
d. IP
",,a,a,,"SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is the correct answer because it is an application layer protocol used for sending emails. The application layer in the TCP/IP model includes protocols that provide user services or application-level functions. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a transport layer protocol, which is responsible for establishing connections and ensuring the reliable transmission of data. Ethernet is a link layer technology used for local area networks, and IP (Internet Protocol) is a network layer protocol that is responsible for routing packets across network boundaries.

b. ARP
c. DHCP
d. DNS
",,b,b,,"ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used by devices to map IP network addresses to the hardware addresses used by a data link protocol. When PC1 wants to communicate with another device on the same network and needs to learn the device's MAC address, it uses ARP to resolve the IP address to the corresponding MAC address. Ping is a utility that checks connectivity at the IP level and doesn't learn information about other devices. DHCP is used for automatically assigning IP addresses to devices on a network.

b. Switch and PC
c. Hub and switch
d. Router and hub
",,"b,d","a,b",,"Straight-through cables are used to connect devices that operate at different layers of the OSI model. Typically, a straight-through cable is used to connect a host to a switch or hub (which are both considered network devices), and a router (a network device) to a PC (a host). Therefore, a straight-through cable would be suitable for connecting a router to a PC and a switch to a PC. Hubs and switches both operate at the same layer (Layer 2), and routers are typically connected to other network devices like switches or hubs using crossover cables, not straight-through cables.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/smb/routers/cisco-rv-series-small-business-routers/smb4284-types-of-network-cables-and-network-cable-connectors.html', 'https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/straight-cable.htm']",0,chapter1_intro_to_networking,0.95,0.999277961499342

b. Advertising known routes to neighboring routers
c. Learning routes for subnets directly connected to the router
d. Forwarding IP packets based on a packet’s destination IP address
",,"a,b","a,b",,"A and B are the correct answers. Routing protocols are used to discover routes that can be used to deliver packets to their destinations. These protocols allow routers to learn about routes from neighboring routers (A) and advertise their known routes to those neighbors (B). Learning routes for directly connected subnets (C) is not a function of routing protocols, as routers automatically know about directly connected networks. Forwarding IP packets (D) is a function of the router's forwarding process, not of the routing protocol itself.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_protocol', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/5212-46.html']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,1,0.9999901957336621

The Domain Name System (DNS) is used to translate human-friendly domain names (like www.examsdigest.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network. When you type a website's hostname into a web browser, the computer uses DNS to retrieve the corresponding IP address before it can send an IP packet to the web server's IP address.
