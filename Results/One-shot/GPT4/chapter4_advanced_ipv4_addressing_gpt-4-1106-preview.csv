",,d,d,,"The correct answer is D. The IP address 10.20.30.5 with a mask of 255.255.255.0 indicates a Class A IP address by the first octet (10). Class A addresses have 8 network bits by default. The subnet mask 255.255.255.0 indicates that the first three octets (24 bits) are used for the network and subnet portion. Since Class A has 8 default network bits, the remaining 16 bits (24 - 8 = 16) are used for subnetting. The last octet (8 bits) is for host addresses within the subnet. Therefore, there are 8 network bits, 16 subnet bits, and 8 host bits.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classful_network', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork']",1,chapter4_advanced_ipv4_addressing,1,0.9999771579518836
