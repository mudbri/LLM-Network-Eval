b. show ip ospf neighbor serial 1/0
c. show ip ospf neighbor fastethernet 0/1
d. show ip ospf serial 0/1
",,b,b,,"B is the correct answer. The command 'show ip ospf neighbor' followed by the interface name is used to display the OSPF neighbors on a specific interface. In this case, 'serial 1/0' is the interface in question, so the command should be 'show ip ospf neighbor serial 1/0'.

",,d,d,,"D is the correct answer. The term 'exterior gateway protocol' refers to protocols that are designed to route between different autonomous systems. These are also known as inter-AS routing protocols or BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) which is the most commonly used exterior gateway protocol on the internet. Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs), such as OSPF or EIGRP, are used within a single autonomous system.

A wildcard mask is used in OSPF to indicate which IP addresses should be included in the network command. The wildcard mask works by matching the bits set to '0' against the corresponding bits of the address and ignoring the bits set to '1'. Therefore, a wildcard mask of 0.255.255.255 means that only the first octet (110) and the second octet (20) must match exactly, while the last two octets can be any value.",['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/open-shortest-path-first-ospf/13685-11.html'],0,chapter6_ospf_routing_protocol,1,0.999992773397112

d. network 20.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 area 0
",,d,d,,"The correct answer is D. The OSPF network command uses a combination of an IP address and a wildcard mask to determine which interfaces are included in the OSPF process. The wildcard mask is the inverse of a subnet mask. In this case, the IP addresses 20.1.20.1, 20.1.30.1, and 20.1.40.1 all fall within the range of 20.0.0.0 to 20.255.255.255.

The command 'show ip ospf interface brief' is used to display a brief list of interfaces on which OSPF is enabled, along with key information about the state of OSPF on those interfaces. The command 'show ip ospf brief' is not a recognized command in Cisco IOS. 'show ip interface brief' provides a summary of all interfaces, including their IP addresses and status, but it does not provide OSPF-specific information.

118,A network engineer connects routers R5 and R6 to the same Ethernet LAN and configures them to use OSPFv2. Which answers describe a combination of settings that would prevent the two routers from becoming OSPF neighbors?,"a. Both routers’ interface IP addresses are in the same subnet
b. Both routers’ OSPF process uses process ID 3
c. Both routers’ OSPF process uses router ID 42.42.42.42
d. Both routers’ interfaces use an OSPF Dead interval of 80
",,c,c,,"C is the correct answer. In OSPF, router IDs must be unique within the same OSPF area. If two routers are configured with the same router ID, they will not form an OSPF adjacency. The router ID is an important component of the OSPF protocol, and it's used to identify the source of OSPF routing information. Options A and D do not prevent OSPF neighbors from forming. Routers on the same Ethernet LAN must have IP addresses in the same subnet to communicate, and the OSPF dead interval is a timer that determines how long a router will wait without hearing from its neighbor before declaring the neighbor down, but it does not need to be different between routers. Option B is irrelevant because the OSPF process ID is locally significant to the router and does not affect neighbor relationships.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Shortest_Path_First', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/open-shortest-path-first-ospf/13685-13.html']",1,chapter6_ospf_routing_protocol,0.95,0.9997305946361441

b. Internal router
c. Backbone router
d. Area Border Router
",,d,d,,"D is the correct answer. An Area Border Router (ABR) in OSPF is a router that has at least one interface in the OSPF backbone area (Area 0) and one or more interfaces in one or more other OSPF areas. It is responsible for routing traffic between the backbone area and other areas, and for summarizing and propagating routing information between them.",['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Shortest_Path_First'],1,chapter6_ospf_routing_protocol,1,0.9999522452652937

b. OSPF
c. RIP
d. IS-IS
",,b,b,,"B is the correct answer. Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a routing protocol with a default Administrative Distance (AD) of 110. The Administrative Distance is a measure used by routers to choose the best path when there are two or more different routes to the same destination from two different routing protocols. IGRP (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) has a default AD of 100, RIP (Routing Information Protocol) has a default AD of 120, and IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) is not commonly assigned a default AD because it is less common, but when compared, it is usually considered similar to OSPF, but the exact value can depend on the router's operating system.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_distance', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/15986-admin-distance.html']",1,chapter6_ospf_routing_protocol,1,0.9999704827216435
