b. 4
c. 32
d. 8

b. Router
c. Switch
d. Firewall
",,d,d,,"A firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies.

39,Which TCP flag is used to make the listening program respond immediately?,"a. ACK
b. PSH
c. URG
d. RST
",,b,b,,"The PSH (Push) flag in TCP is used to indicate that the data should be pushed to the receiving application as soon as possible.

b. Ephemeral ports
c. Sockets
d. System ports

41,"Unlike our five-layer model, the OSI network model adds two more layers on top of the Application Layer. Select examples of these new layers below.","a. The compression layer
b. The session layer
c. The interconnection layer
d. The presentation layer
",,"b,d","b,d",,"The OSI model includes seven layers. Above the Application Layer of the five-layer model, the OSI model includes the Session Layer and the Presentation Layer. The Session Layer (Layer 5) controls the connections between multiple computers.

b. A router
c. TCP
d. A web browser
",,d,d,,"A web browser operates at the application layer of the OSI model, which is layer 7. It provides network services to the applications of the user. UDP and TCP are protocols that operate at the transport layer (layer 4), and a router operates at the network layer (layer 3).","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer']",1,google_3_transport_application_layer,1,0.9999763235462916

b. The payload section of the IP Datagram
c. The payload of the TCP segment
d. The header of the Ethernet frame
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"The data that an application wants to send is encapsulated in the payload sections as it moves down the layers of the TCP/IP model. At the Transport Layer, the data is placed in the payload of the TCP segment. Then, at the Internet Layer, the TCP segment itself is encapsulated within the payload section of the IP Datagram. Finally, at the Link Layer, the IP Datagram is encapsulated within the payload section of the Ethernet frame.
