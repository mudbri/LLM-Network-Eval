d. An emulation is easier to debug than a simulation.
e. Every run of the emulator will yield exactly the same results, resulting in reproducible experiments.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"a. Emulation does not necessarily complete faster than a simulation. The speed depends on the complexity of the system being emulated and the level of detail in the simulation.
b. Emulators often provide a virtualized environment that can be easily transferred or ported from one physical machine to another, making experiments more flexible.
c. Emulators allow real software and systems to be run within the emulation environment, which is a key advantage over simulation, which typically uses models to represent the behavior of software or systems.
d. Debugging is not inherently easier in an emulation compared to a simulation. The ease of debugging depends on the tools available and the nature of the system being tested.
e. Emulation involves running real software, which can have non-deterministic behavior due to timing, concurrency issues, or interactions with external systems.

However, it can emulate latencies between virtual hosts within its emulated environment, but not specific to real-world cities.
b. Mininet allows assigning custom IP addresses to each node in the topology. This is part of the basic functionality of Mininet where you can specify the IP address for each host when you define your network topology.
c. Mininet does not provide a DHCP server by default for assigning IP addresses. IP addresses are typically statically assigned when creating the network topology, although it is possible to run a DHCP server within the Mininet environment if configured by the user.
d. Mininet supports running standard network performance measurement tools like iperf and wget between nodes. This is commonly done to test the performance of the emulated network.

c. Allowing two different researchers to implement and deploy different Web load balancing applications for port 80 traffic.
d. Allowing two different researchers to implement and deploy control mechanisms for two distinct applications.
e. Allowing one controller to control TCP traffic and one controller to control UDP traffic.
",,"b,d,e","b,d,e",,"FlowVisor is a special purpose OpenFlow controller that acts as a transparent proxy between OpenFlow switches and multiple OpenFlow controllers. It creates slices of network resources and delegates control over each slice to a different controller. This enables multiple researchers or controllers to manage different portions of the network without interfering with each other. Therefore, the correct answers are as follows:

b. FlowVisor can allow two controllers to control traffic on distinct VLANs, as VLANs can be used to segment the network into different slices.
d. It allows different researchers to deploy control mechanisms for different applications, effectively managing different slices of the network.
e. FlowVisor can enable one controller to manage TCP traffic and another to manage UDP traffic, by slicing the network based on the type of traffic.

Option a is incorrect because even if FlowVisor allows for multiple controllers, the scenario described would likely cause a conflict as both researchers are trying to manage the same traffic. Option c is incorrect because it is too specific in its application (Web load balancing for port 80) and does not highlight FlowVisor's slicing capability, which is more general and not limited to a specific application or port.",['https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/cs-flowvisor.pdf'],1,7_virtual_networking,0.95,0.6969680713018537

61,Select the statement that is most true about the relationship between network virtualization and SDNs.,"a. Network virtualization is a potential enabler for software-defined networks, since the separation of data and control planes first requires the creation of a logical network.
b. Software-defined networking is a potential enabler for virtual networks, since separation of data and control planes makes it easier to manage a logical network topology.
c. Network virtualization is a new concept introduced by Amazon, Nicira, and industry players; it only made sense to talk about network virtualization once central SDN controllers existed.
d. Network virtualization and software-defined networking each enable the other: SDN cannot exist without network virtualization, and network virtualization cannot exist without SDN.
",,b,b,,"Network virtualization refers to the process of creating a virtual version of network resources (e.g., switches, routers, devices, etc.), which can be managed and configured in software. Software-defined networking (SDN) is an approach to networking that uses software-based controllers or application programming interfaces (APIs) to direct traffic on the network and communicate with the underlying hardware infrastructure. While network virtualization can be implemented without SDN, SDN can greatly facilitate network virtualization by providing a centralized control plane that can manage the virtual network topology more easily. Therefore, SDN is a potential enabler for virtual networks, not the other way around. Moreover, network virtualization existed before SDN, as seen with technologies such as VLANs and VPNs. SDN and network virtualization are complementary technologies, but neither is strictly required for the existence of the other.","['https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-the-definition-of-software-defined-networking-sdn/', 'https://www.networkworld.com/article/2287045/what-is-network-virtualization-.html']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.95,0.9998584481894031
