91,You have noticed that a server with IP 145.45.3.2 doesn’t respond to requests. What command will you type first in order to test connectivity between your device and the server?,"a. request 145.45.3.2
b. check 145.45.3.2
c. ping 145.45.3.2
d. ping 145.45.3.2
",,c,c,,"C is the correct answer. The 'ping' command is a common network utility used to test the reachability of a host on an Internet Protocol (IP) network and to measure the round-trip time for messages sent from the originating host to a destination computer. The syntax of the command is 'ping' followed by the IP address of the destination host. Therefore, to test connectivity to the server with IP 145.45.3.2, you would type 'ping 145.45.3.2'.",['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)'],1,chapter5_ipv4_routing,1,0.9999893165220688
92,"A LAN design uses a Layer 3 EtherChannel between two switches SW1 and SW2, with port-channel interface 1 used on both switches. SW1 uses ports G0/1 and G0/2 in the channel. However, only interface G0/1 is bundled into the channel and working. Think about the configuration settings on port G0/2 that could have existed before adding G0/2 to the EtherChannel. Which answers identify a setting that could prevent IOS from adding G0/2 to the Layer 3 EtherChannel? (Choose two answers.)","a. A different STP cost (spanning-tree cost value)
b. A different access VLAN (switchport access vlan vlanid)
c. A different speed (speed value)
d. A default setting for switchport (switchport)
",,"c,d","c,d",,"C and D are the correct answers. For a port to successfully form an EtherChannel, the settings on the ports being bundled need to match. Specifically, all ports must operate at the same speed and duplex settings (C), and they must be configured the same way in terms of Layer 2 (switchport) versus Layer 3 (no switchport). If G0/2 had a different speed setting or was not configured for Layer 3 (had the default switchport setting), it would not bundle into the Layer 3 EtherChannel. A different STP cost or access VLAN would not prevent the interface from being added to an EtherChannel as those are Layer 2 settings and would not apply to a Layer 3 EtherChannel.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-6500-series-switches/21066-135.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750x_3560x/software/release/15-0_2_se/configuration/guide/scg3750x/swethchl.html']",1,chapter5_ipv4_routing,0.95,0.9999167696928342

e. A connected route for subnet 10.1.1.0 255.255.255.0
",,"a,c","a,c",,"A and C are the correct answers. When a router interface is configured with an IP address, the router automatically creates two types of routes that are entered into the routing table: a connected route for the network to which the interface is directly connected, and a local route for the IP address assigned to the router's interface itself. In this case, the IP address 10.1.1.100 with a subnet mask of /26 corresponds to the network 10.1.1.64/26. Therefore, you would expect to see a connected route for the network 10.1.1.64 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.192. Additionally, you would see a local route for the exact IP address of the interface, which is 10.1.1.100, with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.255, which represents a host route.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html', 'https://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2180210&seqNum=6']",1,chapter5_ipv4_routing,1,0.9999998063873687
