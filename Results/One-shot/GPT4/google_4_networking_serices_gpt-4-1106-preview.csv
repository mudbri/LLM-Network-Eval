46,What transport layer protocol does DNS normally use?,"a. TCP
b. IP
c. UDP
d. ICMP
",,c,c,,"DNS normally uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) for transporting queries and responses between DNS clients and servers. UDP is the preferred protocol because it is faster than TCP, as it does not require establishing a connection before sending data. However, DNS can also use TCP for zone transfers and for queries that exceed the UDP size limit.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System']",1,google_4_networking_serices,0.95,0.9999905085465441
