42,Why does the formula for the number of hosts per subnet (2H â€“ 2) require the subtraction of two hosts?,"a. To reserve two addresses for redundant default gateways(routers)
b. To reserve the two addresses required for DHCP operation
c. To reserve addresses for the subnet broadcast address and subnet ID
d. To reserve addresses for the subnet ID and default gateway (router)
",,c,c,,"C is the correct answer. In IPv4 subnetting, the formula for calculating the number of usable host IP addresses within a subnet is (2^H - 2), where H is the number of host bits. The subtraction of two addresses is necessary because one address is reserved for the network identifier (subnet ID), which represents the subnet itself, and another is reserved for the broadcast address, which is used to send a packet to all hosts within the subnet. These two addresses cannot be assigned to hosts. The default gateway's IP address is one of the usable host IP addresses within the subnet, and DHCP operation does not require reserving two separate addresses outside of the usable range.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address#IPv4_subnetting', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13769-5.html']",1,chapter3_ipv4_addressing,0.99,0.9995763270347484
