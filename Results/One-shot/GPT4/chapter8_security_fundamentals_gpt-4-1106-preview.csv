137,"In a spoofing attack, which of the following parameters are commonly spoofed? (Choose two answers)","a. Source IP address
b. MAC address
c. ARP address
d. Routing table
e. Destination IP address
f. ARP table
",,"a,b","a,b",,"In a spoofing attack, the most commonly spoofed parameters are the source IP address and the MAC address. Attackers often spoof source IP addresses to make their network traffic appear as though it is coming from a trusted, legitimate source, thereby bypassing IP-based security measures. MAC address spoofing can be used to impersonate another device on the local network, allowing the attacker to intercept, modify, or block communications between devices. The ARP address is not a correct term; it is likely a confusion with the ARP table or ARP cache, which can be poisoned but is not directly spoofed. Spoofing a routing table or destination IP address is not typically referred to as spoofing; instead, it involves altering routing information or redirecting traffic, which could be part of a route manipulation or a man-in-the-middle attack, respectively. The ARP table can be poisoned in an ARP spoofing attack, but the table itself is not spoofed; rather, it is the ARP messages that are spoofed to poison the table.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address_spoofing', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_spoofing', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing']",1,chapter8_security_fundamentals,0.95,0.9618285478004536

",,c,c,,"AAA servers, which stand for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting, commonly support the protocol TACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus) and RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) to communicate with enterprise resources. Both TACACS+ and RADIUS are protocols used for network access authentication and accounting, but they are different in terms of how they encrypt data and their flexibility in carrying authentication data. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is used for dynamically distributing network configuration parameters, such as IP addresses. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used for mapping IP network addresses to the hardware addresses used by a data link protocol.

140,"_____________________ attacks typically function by overwhelming or flooding a targeted machine with requests until normal traffic is unable to be processed, resulting in denial- of-service to additional users.","a. Spoofing
b. Phishing
c. DoS
d. SQL injection
",,c,c,,"C is the correct answer. DoS, or Denial of Service attacks, are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by overwhelming the services of a host connected to the internet. This is typically done through the inundation of the target with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled. Spoofing (a) is a technique used to gain unauthorized access to computers, wherein the intruder sends messages to a computer with an IP address indicating that the message is coming from a trusted host. Phishing (b) is a method of trying to gather personal information using deceptive e-mails and websites.

c. Whaling
d. Pharming
",,c,c,,"C is the correct answer. Whaling is a specific type of phishing attack that targets high-profile individuals such as the CEO or CFO of a company. The term 'whaling' is used because it refers to the 'big fish' targets, implying that these individuals have a higher level of access or more valuable information than the average employee. While social engineering is a broader category of manipulative tactics that can include whaling, and phishing is a technique that often involves sending fraudulent emails to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, whaling is the term that specifically refers to attacks against high-profile individuals.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/what-is-phishing.html', 'https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-emerging-threats-whaling-cyber-security.html']",1,chapter8_security_fundamentals,0.95,0.9999694099178861

b. DAI
c. Packet secure
d. ARP protect
",,b,b,,"Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is the correct answer. DAI is a security feature that rejects invalid and malicious ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) packets. It helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks such as ARP spoofing or ARP poisoning, where an attacker sends false ARP messages over a local area network. This results in the linking of an attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network. DoS (Denial of Service) is an attack meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users. 'Packet secure' is not a standard term for a specific security feature. 'ARP protect' is not a commonly used term in the context of ARP security, although some vendors may use similar terms for features that protect against ARP-related issues.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12-2SX/configuration/guide/book/dynarp.html']",1,chapter8_security_fundamentals,0.95,0.9999310282486606

b. Match message application data
c. Match message IP protocol 23
d. Match message source TCP ports lower than 5400
",,b,b,,"B is the correct answer. Next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) have the capability to perform deep packet inspection and can look beyond the standard port and protocol to actually understand the application data being sent over the network. This means that a NGFW can identify and block specific applications, like Telnet, regardless of the port being used. Traditional firewalls typically only match on IP addresses, ports (like well-known port 23 for Telnet), and protocols, and do not have the ability to inspect the application layer data. Therefore, the NGFW's ability to match message application data is what sets it apart from traditional firewalls in this context.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next-generation_firewall', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/what-is-a-next-generation-firewall.html']",1,chapter8_security_fundamentals,0.95,0.9997267811510696
