95,What are some benefits to using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Host configuration is simpler, since all hosts are visible from a single large Ethernet topology.
b. Forwarding on physical MAC addresses is simpler, since both the data center network topology and hosts' physical MAC addresses are hierarchical.
c. IP routing does not need to be reconfigured when physical or virtual machines move from one part of the network to another.
d. Scaling problems are simpler, since all hosts are configured on a single, flat topology.
e. Load balancing is easier on a layer-2 topology than on a layer 3 topology.
",,"a,c","a,c,d",,"a. Host configuration is indeed simpler in a large Ethernet topology because hosts do not need to be configured with different subnet settings, which simplifies deployment and management.

b. This statement is incorrect. MAC addresses are flat and not hierarchical, so forwarding based on physical MAC addresses does not benefit from any inherent hierarchy in the data center network topology.

c. When using a layer-2 MAC topology, IP routing does not need to be reconfigured when machines move because they maintain the same MAC address regardless of their location within the layer-2 domain. This is known as VM mobility or live migration support.

d. Scaling is perceived as simpler because in a flat layer-2 network, the complexity of dealing with multiple subnets and routing is not present. However, large flat networks can have their own set of scaling issues, such as broadcast domain size.

e. Load balancing can be performed on both layer-2 and layer-3 topologies, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements and design of the network. There is no inherent reason why load balancing would be easier on a layer-2 topology.","['https://www.networkcomputing.com/data-centers/pros-and-cons-layer-2-vs-layer-3-architecture', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise/design-zone-data-centers/design-guide-data-center-interconnect.html', 'https://community.fs.com/blog/layer-2-vs-layer-3-switch.html']",0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.95,0.9999386271750889
96,"In PortLand, what are the reasons for assigning hosts pseudo-MAC addresses, as opposed to simply forwarding traffic on physical MAC addresses? Select all that apply.","a. Hosts in the data-center network topology are more vulnerable to attack if they expose their actual physical MAC addresses, rather than having a layer of indirection.
b. It is very difficult to load balance traffic using physical MAC addresses; pseudo MAC addresses make it possible to assign traffic to destination IP addresses.
c. Without pseudo-MAC addresses, switches would have to update forwarding state whenever hosts with a particular MAC address moved from one portion of the topology to another.
d. Forwarding loops are be more common in a flat layer-2 topology than they are in a topology with hierarchical pseudo MAC addresses.
e. In a flat layer-2 topology, switches cannot know on which port to forward traffic without maintaining switch tables for each MAC address, since MAC addresses are flat, not hierarchical.
",,"c,e","c,e",,"a. The use of pseudo-MAC addresses in PortLand is not primarily for security purposes, so this is not the correct reason for their use.
b. Load balancing can be achieved through various methods, and the use of pseudo-MAC addresses in PortLand is not specifically for load balancing based on destination IP addresses.
c. Pseudo-MAC addresses provide a location-independent way of addressing hosts. When a host moves, its pseudo-MAC address can remain the same, and only the location directory service within PortLand needs to be updated. This reduces the need for switches to update their forwarding state.
d. Forwarding loops are prevented in PortLand by the routing protocol and not directly by the use of pseudo-MAC addresses. While hierarchical addressing can help with loop prevention, it's not the primary reason for pseudo-MAC addresses in PortLand.
e. PortLand uses a pseudo-MAC address scheme to encode the location of a host within the data center topology. This hierarchical addressing allows switches to make forwarding decisions without needing to maintain large tables of MAC addresses, as the address itself provides hints about the location within the topology.
Therefore, the correct answers are options c and e, as they describe the benefits of using pseudo-MAC addresses for location-independent addressing and hierarchical forwarding decisions.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1592568.1592575', 'https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sigcomm09/tech/full_papers/mysore/mysore.pdf']",1,13_SDN_use_cases,0.95,0.9565228310683773
97,What are the steps involved in the Proxy ARP process that PortLand's Fabric Manager runs?,"a. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns returns PMAC directly to the end host.
b. Edge switch sends ARP query to fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch updates its local PMAC mapping table.
c. Host sends ARP query, fabric manager intercepts ARP query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to end host.
d. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to the host.
e. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch returns PMAC to end host.
",,e,e,,"In PortLand's Proxy ARP process, when a host sends an ARP query, the edge switch of the network intercepts the query. This is because in a PortLand network, the ARP process is managed centrally to maintain consistency and scalability. The edge switch then redirects the query to the fabric manager, which acts as the central authority. The fabric manager consults its PMAC (Pseudo MAC) mapping table to find the corresponding PMAC for the requested IP address. Once the PMAC is found, it is returned to the edge switch, and finally, the edge switch sends the PMAC back to the host that originated the ARP query. This process helps in maintaining a consistent view of the network and avoids broadcast traffic that traditional ARP would generate.","['https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5339661', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1592568.1592575']",1,13_SDN_use_cases,0.95,0.9870040107306718
98,"What are some of the disadvantages of today's interdomain routing protocol, BGP? Select all that apply.","a. ISPs cannot load-balance traffic across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix.
b. Routing and forwarding decisions are only based on IP prefix, not on a broader range of traffic flow attributes.
c. ISPs can only influence route selection through indirect mechanisms (e.g., prepending), rather than directly manipulating the forwarding table entries in switches.
d. ISPs cannot express preference of one route over another, given multiple routes to a destination.
e. ISPs can only influence the routing decisions of their immediate neighbor, not the entire end-to-end path.
",,"b,c,e","b,c,e",,"a. ISPs can load-balance traffic across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix, though BGP does not natively support equal-cost multipath (ECMP) routing, it is possible through implementation-specific features.

b. BGP primarily makes routing decisions based on IP prefixes and path attributes such as AS_PATH, NEXT_HOP, and others, but it does not consider a broader range of traffic flow attributes like application types or quality of service requirements, which could be seen as a disadvantage in certain scenarios.

c. ISPs can influence route selection through mechanisms like AS_PATH prepending, local preference, and MED (Multi-Exit Discriminator), but they cannot directly manipulate forwarding table entries in switches that are not under their administrative control.

d. ISPs can express preference of one route over another by using BGP attributes such as local preference and AS_PATH length to prioritize certain routes.

e. ISPs can only influence the routing decisions of their immediate BGP neighbors through BGP advertisements. They do not have direct control over the entire end-to-end path, as BGP is a decentralized protocol and each autonomous system makes its own independent routing decisions based on the information available to it.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/13753-25.html', 'https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/db/support/configuring-bgp-best-practices', 'https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/bgp/topics/topic-map/bgp-load-balancing.html']",1,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,0.9048537181101493

b. Application-specific peering
c. Wide-area load balancing using DNS-based redirection
d. On-the-fly redirection to middleboxes
e. Wide-area load balancing using IP packet rewriting
",,"b,d,e","a,b,d,e",,"a. SDXes allow participants to define policies that can be applied differently based on geographic regions, which traditional IXPs cannot do as they typically operate within the confines of a specific location or set of locations without such granularity in policy application.
b. Application-specific peering is a feature enabled by SDXes where network operators can apply policies that are specific to certain types of traffic or applications, which is not typically supported by traditional IXPs.
d. SDXes enable on-the-fly redirection to middleboxes, allowing for dynamic service chaining and traffic steering that is not feasible with the static nature of traditional IXPs.
e. Wide-area load balancing using IP packet rewriting is another feature of SDXes, where traffic can be distributed across multiple paths based on IP packet header information, unlike traditional IXPs which do not offer such fine-grained traffic management capabilities.

b. Software Defined Networking (SDN) allows for the development of better user interfaces that can provide more control and visibility over the network, which can be more user-friendly than the default interfaces on routers.
c. SDN can enable a more flexible architecture where multiple service providers can offer services over the same home network infrastructure, allowing for a variety of applications and services to be used.
d. Outsourcing control and management to a third party is a possible use case but not a direct motivation for applying SDN in home networks. It is more of a consequence or service model that could be enabled by SDN.

1. Block all traffic to Facebook from my child's computer.
2. Rate limit BitTorrent traffic from my child's computer if the VoIP client on my desktop is active.
Which of the following most closely approximates the policy?

d. (match(srcip=child, dstip=facebook) + drop) >> (match(srcip=child, dstport=bittorrent) + dynamic(limitIfVOIP))
",,c,c,,"The policy described requires two separate rules: one to block traffic to Facebook and another to rate limit BitTorrent traffic conditionally based on VOIP activity. In pseudocode-like policy language, the '+' operator typically denotes 'and' (applying multiple actions or conditions), while '>>' is often used to denote 'then' (applying one action after another). Option c uses '>>' to indicate that after matching the source IP to the child's computer and the destination IP to Facebook, the action to drop the packets should be executed. Similarly, for BitTorrent traffic, after matching the source IP to the child's computer and the destination port to BitTorrent, the dynamic policy 'limitIfVOIP' should be applied. Option c correctly separates the two rules with a '+', indicating that these are two distinct rules rather than a sequence of actions to be applied to the same packets.","['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128616303324', 'https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall16/cos561/papers/ethane07.pdf']",1,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,0.9791830190802547
