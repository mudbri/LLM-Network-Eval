b. dynamic PAT
c. static PAT
d. policy NAT
e. dynamic NAT
",,d,d,,"Policy NAT (also known as Policy-based NAT) enables a firewall to perform translations based on the destination address or other criteria specified in the policy. This allows for more granular control over the translation process than what is offered by static NAT, dynamic NAT, or the various forms of Port Address Translation (PAT).

b. policy NAT
c. dynamic PAT
d. dynamic NAT
",,c,c,,"Dynamic Port Address Translation (PAT), also known as NAT overload, uses port addresses to distinguish between translated sessions. This allows multiple internal hosts to share a single or a small number of external IP addresses, with the differentiation between sessions being made based on the port number used. Static NAT provides a one-to-one mapping between an internal and external address, without regard to port numbers. Dynamic NAT also maps unregistered IP addresses to registered IP addresses from a pool of registered IP addresses, but it does not use port numbers to distinguish between connections. Policy NAT can use additional criteria like access lists to determine how traffic is translated, but it doesn't inherently use port addresses to distinguish between translated sessions.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/network-address-translation-nat/13772-12.html', 'https://www.networkstraining.com/difference-between-nat-and-pat/']",1,NetSec,1,0.9998877612432406

The malware is installed on compromised systems, which are then remotely controlled by the attacker to carry out the attack, making it difficult to trace the attack back to the actual source. Choices a, c, and d are specific types of attacks or techniques that could be used in an attack, but they do not inherently involve the use of a remote control mechanism like a CnC server.","['https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/command-and-control-servers/', 'https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/command-and-control-c-c-server']",1,NetSec,0.95,0.9989407168369253
32,Which TCP/IP application protocol can be used in an amplification attack by exploiting the protocol weakness in recursive lookup? Select one choice.,"a. HTTPS
b. LDAP
c. HTTP
d. DNS
e. SMTP
",,d,d,,"DNS (Domain Name System) is known to be susceptible to amplification attacks, which exploit the protocol's recursive lookup feature. In a DNS amplification attack, the attacker sends a DNS lookup request with a spoofed source IP address (the victim's IP address) to a recursive DNS server. The server then sends a much larger response to the victim's IP address, which can overwhelm the victim's network resources. The other protocols listed do not have the same amplification potential through recursive lookups.","['https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-088A', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/dns-amplification-ddos-attack/']",1,NetSec,0.98,0.9997489435499461
33,Which type of attack forces a machine to respond to a SYN message by sending a packet to itself on the same port it received the SYN? Select one choice.,"a. Smurf
b. Land attack
c. Amplification attack
d. Reflection attack
",,b,b,,"A Land attack is a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack where the attacker sends a spoofed TCP SYN packet with the same source and destination IP address and port number to a victim's computer. This causes the machine to reply to itself continuously, which can consume resources and potentially lead to a crash. The other options listed are different types of attacks: a Smurf attack involves sending ICMP requests with a spoofed source IP address to a network broadcast address, causing all hosts on the network to respond to the spoofed address. An Amplification attack involves the attacker sending small queries to a server that responds with much larger replies, thereby amplifying the amount of data sent to the victim. A Reflection attack involves sending requests to a third-party server with a spoofed source IP address that is actually the victim's address, causing the server to send the response to the victim.","['https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/land-attack/', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/smurf-ddos-attack/', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/dns-amplification-ddos-attack/', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/reflection-ddos-attack/']",1,NetSec,1,0.9997073637663378
34,A Layer 2 redirect or spoofing attack can be referred to as what type of attack? Select one choice.,"a. ARP attack
b. DHCP attack
c. NetBios attack
d. SSID attack
",,a,a,,A Layer 2 redirect or spoofing attack that targets the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) can be referred to as an ARP attack. This type of attack involves the attacker sending falsified ARP messages over a local area network to link the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network. This results in the traffic that was supposed to go to that IP address being sent to the attacker instead.,"['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/arp-spoofing.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing']",1,NetSec,1,0.9999728667271139
35,Which one of the following options is the illegitimate DHCP server that is referred to in the context of a DHCP server-based attack? Select one choice.,"a. A sitting duck server
b. A rogue DHCP server
c. A target server
d. An erroneous server
",,b,b,,"A rogue DHCP server refers to an unauthorized DHCP server on a network. Such servers can be used in DHCP server-based attacks to provide incorrect IP addresses and other network information to clients, potentially redirecting traffic or causing other disruptions. The term 'rogue' is commonly used in networking to describe unauthorized or illegitimate devices or services.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/identity-services-engine/200292-Prevent-IP-Spoofing-with-DHCP-Snooping.html', 'https://www.techopedia.com/definition/17001/rogue-dhcp-server']",1,NetSec,1,0.9993815177390508
36,What is one way of mitigating DHCP attacks by using a Cisco switch? Select one choice.,"a. VLAN segmentation
b. MAC address security
c. DHCP snooping
d. DHCP authentication""
",,c,c,,"DHCP snooping is a security feature on switches that mitigates DHCP attacks such as DHCP spoofing. It works by filtering untrusted DHCP messages and by building and maintaining a DHCP snooping binding table, which contains information about untrusted hosts with leased IP addresses. This feature ensures that only responses from a trusted DHCP server are relayed to the clients. Therefore, DHCP snooping is the correct answer for mitigating DHCP attacks using a Cisco switch.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12-2SX/configuration/guide/book/snoodhcp.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/dynamic-address-allocation-resolution/27470-100.html']",1,NetSec,1,0.9998412891059067
