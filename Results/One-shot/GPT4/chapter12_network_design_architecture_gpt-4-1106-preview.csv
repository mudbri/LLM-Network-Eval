208,Which of the following roles of campus switches provides a connection point for end-user devices?,"a. Access
b. Distribution
c. Core
d. Campus
",,a,a,,"The access layer is the part of the campus network design where end devices such as computers, printers, and phones connect to the network. Access switches serve as the entry point for network traffic from these devices into the network infrastructure. The distribution layer aggregates the data from the access layer before it is routed to the core layer, and the core layer is the high-speed backbone of the network, but neither is directly involved with connecting end-user devices. The term 'campus' is not a specific role but rather refers to the entire campus network, which includes access, distribution, and core layers.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/what-is-a-campus-network.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Campus/campover.html']",1,chapter12_network_design_architecture,1,0.9999574899895761
209,Which of the following roles of campus switches provides an aggregation point for access switches?,"a. Access
b. Distribution
c. Core
d. Campus
",,b,b,,"B is the correct answer. In a typical three-tier campus network design, the distribution layer serves as the aggregation point for the access switches. Its primary functions are to aggregate the data from the access switches before it is forwarded to the core layer and to enforce policies, segment traffic, and manage routing between VLANs. The access layer is where end devices connect to the network, the core layer is designed for high-speed packet switching, and the term 'campus' is a general reference to the entire network rather than a specific role of a switch.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise/design-zone-campus/index.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Campus/campover.html']",1,chapter12_network_design_architecture,1,0.9999735819309633
210,Which of the following roles of campus switches aggregates distribution switches in very large campus LANs?,"a. Access
b. Distribution
c. Core
d. Campus
",,c,c,,"The core layer (also known as the backbone layer) in a campus network architecture is responsible for aggregating the traffic from all distribution switches and routing it quickly through the campus network. It is the central part of the LAN and is designed to be highly reliable and fast to ensure that packets are routed as efficiently as possible within the campus network. The access layer connects end devices to the network, the distribution layer aggregates the access switches and routes traffic between different subnets, and there is no specific 'campus' role in the traditional three-tier campus LAN design.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/enterprise-network-architecture/index.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_network']",1,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,0.9999079046010416
211,Your company plans to start using public cloud service and now you are considering different WAN options. Your main concern is security by keeping the data private while also providing good QoS services. Which of the following options are under consideration? (Choose two answers.),"a. Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider
b. Using an Internet connection without VPN
c. Using an Internet connection with VPN
d. Using an intercloud exchange
",,"a,d","a,c",,"A and C are the correct answers. Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider, such as AWS Direct Connect or Azure ExpressRoute, can ensure data remains private because it does not traverse the public Internet and can provide better QoS by offering a dedicated and consistent network experience. Using an Internet connection with a VPN is another option that can secure the data by encrypting it as it travels over the public Internet, although it typically does not provide the same level of QoS as a private direct connection. Option B is not under consideration because it does not address the concern of keeping the data private, and option D, using an intercloud exchange, is a concept that allows for the movement of workloads across different cloud providers and does not inherently address private data concerns or QoS.","['https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/', 'https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/expressroute/', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/enterprise-network-security/vpn-security.html']",0,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,0.9999550316161081
212,"One of the differences between Public Cloud and Private Cloud (On-Premise) is that on the Public Cloud solution you are responsible for all management, maintenance, and updating of data centers.","a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",,b,b,,"B is the correct answer. In a Public Cloud solution, the cloud service provider is responsible for the management, maintenance, and updating of data centers. Customers using public cloud services typically manage their data and applications, but not the underlying infrastructure. In contrast, with a Private Cloud (On-Premise), the organization is responsible for managing, maintaining, and updating its own data centers.","['https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-a-public-cloud/', 'https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/private-cloud']",1,chapter12_network_design_architecture,1,0.9997352423245008
213,"A company uses a Metro Ethernet WAN with an Ethernet LAN (E-LAN) service, with the company headquarters plus 20 remote sites connected to the service. The enterprise uses OSPF at all sites, with one router connected to the service from each site. Which of the following are true about the Layer 3 details most likely used with this service and design? (Choose all that apply)","a. The WAN uses one IP subnet
b. The WAN uses 20 or more IP subnets
c. A remote site router would have one OSPF neighbor
d. A remote site router would have 20 OSPF neighbors
",,"a,d","a,c",,"A and C are the correct answers. In an E-LAN service, all sites appear to be on the same Layer 2 network, which allows them to be on the same IP subnet. Therefore, the WAN could use just one IP subnet. Since all sites appear to be on the same Layer 2 network, each remote site router would see all other routers as directly connected on the same subnet. Consequently, each router would have just one OSPF neighbor relationship with the headquarters router, assuming the headquarters router is configured to form OSPF neighbor relationships with all the remote routers. However, if the OSPF design is such that each router should form an OSPF adjacency with each other router, then each router would have 20 OSPF neighbors (one for each site, excluding itself). Without specific details on the OSPF design, the most likely scenario in an E-LAN service is that each site only maintains an OSPF neighbor relationship with the headquarters router.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Enterprise/WAN_and_MAN/EME.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_Metro_Area_Network']",0,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.85,0.9995725259030981
