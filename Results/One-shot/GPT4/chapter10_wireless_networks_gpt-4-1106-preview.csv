179,"When APs are placed at different geographic locations, they can all be interconnected by a switched infrastructure. The 802.11 standard calls this an extended service set (ESS).","a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",,a,a,,"A is the correct answer. An Extended Service Set (ESS) is a set of two or more Basic Service Sets (BSSs) that form a single subnetwork. Access Points (APs) in an ESS are connected by a distribution system, which is typically a wired ethernet network. This allows users to roam seamlessly within the geographic coverage area of the ESS, maintaining a continuous connection to the wireless network. The 802.11 standards define ESS to support this kind of infrastructure.",['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_set_(802.11_network)'],1,chapter10_wireless_networks,0.95,0.999813284773458
180,A lightweight access point in which one of the following architectures participate?,"a. Light-MAC
b. Tunnel-MAC
c. Big-MAC
d. Split-MAC
",,d,d,,"A lightweight access point participates in a 'Split-MAC' architecture. In this architecture, some MAC functions are handled by the access point itself (such as real-time MAC operations like beaconing, probing, and data acknowledgment), while other functions (such as authentication and association control) are handled by a wireless LAN controller. This architecture allows for centralized management of multiple access points and is a common model in enterprise wireless networks.",['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless-mobility/wireless-lan-wlan/70937-lap-register.html'],1,chapter10_wireless_networks,0.95,0.9999768003491161
181,Which of the following controller ports is used to connect to a peer controller for high availability (HA) operation?,"a. Service port
b. Distribution system port
c. Redundancy port
d. Console port
",,c,c,,"C is the correct answer. The redundancy port on a controller is used to connect to a peer controller for high availability operation. This port is specifically designed for synchronization and stateful switchover between the active and standby controllers, ensuring that the standby controller can take over in case the primary controller fails. The service port is typically used for out-of-band management, the distribution system port connects the controller to the network for data traffic, and the console port is for direct device management and is not used for HA.",['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/technotes/8-5/b_high_availability_DG.html'],1,chapter10_wireless_networks,0.95,0.9999623771457573
182,Which of the following wireless security tools is used to protect the integrity of data in a wireless frame?,"a. MIC
b. WIPS
c. WEP
d. EAP
",,a,a,,"A (MIC) is the correct answer. MIC stands for Message Integrity Check, which is a security feature used to protect the integrity of the data in a wireless frame. It ensures that the data has not been tampered with from the time it was sent to the time it is received. WIPS (Wireless Intrusion Prevention System) is a network device that monitors the radio spectrum for the presence of unauthorized access points. WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is an outdated security protocol that was designed to provide a wireless local area network (WLAN) with a level of security and privacy comparable to what is usually expected of a wired LAN. EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) is an authentication framework, not a specific protocol, used in wireless networks and Point-to-Point connections. While WEP and EAP are related to wireless security, they do not specifically protect the integrity of data in a wireless frame like MIC does.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11i-2004', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Authentication_Protocol']",1,chapter10_wireless_networks,0.95,0.9998981308540138

184,Which of the following bridges can be used to provide wireless connectivity to a non-wireless device?,"a. Wireless repeater
b. Workgroup bridge
c. Transparent bridge
d. Adaptive bridge
",,b,b,,"B is the correct answer. A workgroup bridge is used to connect a non-wireless device to a wireless network. It acts as a client to the wireless network and provides an Ethernet port where you can plug in a device that does not have wireless capabilities. Wireless repeaters are used to extend the range of a wireless network. Transparent bridges are used in wired networks to connect two network segments without making any changes to the packets. Adaptive bridges are capable of connecting different types of networks together, but they are not specifically designed to provide wireless connectivity to non-wireless devices.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless-mobility/wireless-lan-wlan/200046-Configuring-a-Workgroup-Bridge-WGB-on-Air.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_bridge']",1,chapter10_wireless_networks,0.95,0.9999270948117124
185,Which controller interface type maps a WLAN to a VLAN?,"a. Management interface
b. Redundancy management
c. Virtual interface
d. Service port interface
e. Dynamic interface
",,e,e,,"The correct answer is E. In controller-based wireless networking, the dynamic interface is used to map WLANs to VLANs. It is the interface on the wireless LAN controller that is used for this purpose, as it allows for the assignment of VLAN IDs to WLANs, enabling client traffic to be separated and routed appropriately through the network. Management, redundancy management, virtual, and service port interfaces serve different purposes and are not used for mapping WLANs to VLANs.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/technotes/8-6/b_cisco_wlc_features_by_release.html', 'https://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2180210&seqNum=2']",1,chapter10_wireless_networks,0.95,0.999975250738268
186,Which is the most preferred and secure way of connecting to a WLC GUI to configure a new WLAN?,"a. SSH
b. HTTP
c. HTTPS
d. FTP
e. None of the above
",,c,c,,"C is the correct answer. When connecting to a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) to configure a new WLAN, the most preferred and secure method is HTTPS. HTTPS provides encryption through SSL/TLS, ensuring that the communication between the client and the WLC is secure. SSH is a secure method for command-line management but not for accessing a GUI. HTTP is insecure because it transmits data in plaintext. FTP is used for file transfers and is not relevant for accessing a WLC GUI. Therefore, HTTPS is the best option for secure GUI access to a WLC.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless/wireless-lan-controller-software/213972-configure-wireless-lan-controller-wlc-to.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS']",1,chapter10_wireless_networks,1,0.9999862172649827

b. Autonomous Access Point (AP)
c. Independent Access Point (AP)
d. Cisco Access Point (AP)
",,b,b,,"B is the correct answer. Cisco refers to wireless access points that operate independently without the need for a wireless controller as 'Autonomous Access Points.' They are managed individually and are suitable for small-scale deployments where central management is not required. The term 'standalone' is a general term that could apply, but within Cisco terminology, the specific term is 'autonomous.'

191,"You are creating a new WLAN with the controller GUI, which of the following parameters are necessary? (Choose two)","a. VLAN number
b. SSID
c. Interface
d. BSSID
e. IP subnet
",,"b,c","a,b",,"When creating a new WLAN with the controller GUI, the two necessary parameters are the VLAN number and the SSID. The VLAN number (a) is required to determine which VLAN the WLAN will be associated with, which is important for network segmentation and managing traffic. The SSID (b) is the network name that clients will see and use to connect to the WLAN. The interface (c) and IP subnet (e) are often configured as well, but they are not always directly specified when initially creating the WLAN; they can be associated with the VLAN configuration. The BSSID (d) is the MAC address of the wireless access point's interface for that SSID, which is not typically manually configured as it is automatically generated by the access point.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/technotes/8-3/b_cisco_wireless_lan_controller_configuration_best_practices.html', 'https://documentation.meraki.com/MR/Client_Addressing_and_Bridging/SSID_Modes_for_Client_IP_Assignment']",0,chapter10_wireless_networks,0.95,0.9999596803598586

Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is a wireless security protocol that was designed to provide a wireless local area network (WLAN) with a level of security and privacy comparable to what is usually expected of a wired LAN. However, WEP has been found to have several serious weaknesses and is considered insecure. It is not recommended for use due to these vulnerability issues.
