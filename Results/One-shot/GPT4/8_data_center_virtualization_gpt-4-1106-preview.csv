c. A controller can prevent one network slice from interfering with the resources of another.
d. Multi-tenant datacenters are one use case for network slicing.
e. Conventional (i.e., non-SDN) networks have no concept of network virtualization or slicing.
",,"a,b,d","a,b,c,d",,"a. Network slicing allows for the creation of separate virtual networks over a common physical infrastructure. It is possible to test configurations on these virtual networks without affecting the production network, which can be seen as 'shadow' networks.
 b. Network slicing can be achieved by dividing the network according to flow space, where each slice handles different traffic flows and can be managed by different controllers.
 c. Controllers in software-defined networks (SDNs) can enforce isolation between slices, ensuring that one slice does not interfere with the resources of another.
 d. Multi-tenant datacenters, where multiple clients or tenants share the same infrastructure, can benefit from network slicing by isolating each tenant's traffic and services.
 e. Conventional networks do have concepts of network virtualization, such as VLANs and VPNs, which provide some level of separation and isolation between different network segments.","['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405959516300568', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7414381', 'https://www.networkworld.com/article/3236495/what-is-network-slicing.html']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.95,0.997941680553779
63,Which of the following are true about flow spaces? Select all that apply.,"a. Two flow spaces cannot overlap.
b. One host could send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces.
c. Flow spaces can only be defined according to combinations of packet header fields.
d. Flowspace isolation separates individual virtual networks from one another but incurs some performance penalty for doing so.
e. Two controllers that write data-plane rules for non-overlapping parts of flowspace can never cause traffic from one “slice” to enter the other slice.
",,b,"b,d",,"a. Two flow spaces can overlap; this is a common scenario in Software Defined Networking where different policies might apply to overlapping sets of traffic.
b. It is possible for one host to send traffic that matches different flow space definitions, resulting in the traffic being classified into different flow spaces depending on the match criteria.
c. While flow spaces are often defined by packet header fields, they can also be influenced by other factors such as incoming port, time of day, or even traffic patterns.
d. Flowspace isolation does indeed separate virtual networks, and there can be a performance penalty due to the additional processing required to enforce isolation.
e. Even if two controllers write non-overlapping data-plane rules, there can be scenarios where misconfigurations or exceptions cause traffic from one slice to inadvertently enter another slice.","['https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6636608', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2342441.2342448', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128616303323']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,0.5501396207946652
64,Which of the following describe the control-plane checks that FlowVisor implements? Select all that apply.,"a. When a packet must be forwarded to a controller, Flowvisor forwards traffic to the correct controller based on which controller “owns” the flowspace corresponding to that packet.
b. Flowvisor prevents each slice's controller from being the target of a denial of service attack from other slices.
c. Flowvisor can only instantiate network slices based on the network topology, not based on other properties, such as application traffic.
d. Flowvisor prevents a controller from writing data-plane rules to a part of flowspace that it does not own.
e. Flowvisor installs traffic shaping and quality of service rules to ensure that each network slice has guaranteed resources.
",,"a,d","a,d",,"a. FlowVisor is a special purpose OpenFlow controller that acts as a transparent proxy between other OpenFlow controllers and switches. It forwards the traffic to the correct controller based on the flowspace rules that have been defined for each slice, ensuring that each controller only manages its designated portion of the network.

b. While FlowVisor does provide isolation between slices, it doesn't specifically prevent denial of service attacks from other slices; its main function is to enforce slice policies and not to handle security issues like DoS attacks.

c. FlowVisor does not limit network slices to being based only on network topology. It can also create slices based on other properties such as the type of traffic, which can include application traffic.

d. FlowVisor ensures that a controller cannot affect the traffic of another slice by writing data-plane rules for a part of the flowspace that it does not own. It enforces isolation between slices by making sure controllers can only control their assigned flowspace.

e. FlowVisor itself does not install traffic shaping and quality of service rules. It is responsible for dividing the network into slices and ensuring that each slice adheres to its defined rules. QoS and traffic shaping are typically responsibilities of the individual controllers or additional network management tools.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/cs-flowvisor.pdf', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915004115']",1,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,0.9994582374863359

b. Traceback of attack traffic to its source
c. Smart grid applications
d. Load balance of inbound traffic
e. Guest WiFi access
",,"a,c,e","a,c,e",,"Network slicing is a type of network configuration that allows multiple virtual networks to be created atop a shared physical infrastructure. Each 'slice' can have its own unique properties and service levels. In the context of a home network, network slicing could enable the following applications: 

a. Quality of service for certain applications (e.g., video streaming) - Network slices can be configured to prioritize certain types of traffic, ensuring that latency-sensitive applications like video streaming have the necessary bandwidth and low latency.

b. Traceback of attack traffic to its source - While important for security, traceback is not directly an application of network slicing. It is more related to security monitoring and forensic analysis.

c. Smart grid applications - Network slices can be dedicated to smart home devices, including those used in smart grid applications, to ensure reliable and secure communication.

d. Load balance of inbound traffic - Load balancing typically refers to distributing traffic across multiple servers or links to optimize resource use and throughput, which is not specific to network slicing.
