91,Which of the following have examples of parallel composition? Select all that apply.,"a. Perform load balancing on any traffic that arrives from prefix 130.207.0.0/16 or is destined to port 80.
b. Perform MAC learning on all traffic that is not blocked by a firewall rule.
c. Count all port 80 traffic.
d. Block all traffic whose source IP address is contained in a list of blocked IP addresses.
e. Load balance traffic across multiple destination IP addresses and perform routing to the resulting destination IP addresses.
",,"a,c,d","a,e",,"Parallel composition in networking, particularly in the context of Software Defined Networking (SDN), refers to the ability to apply multiple network policies or functions simultaneously to network traffic. It implies that these policies can work in tandem without interference. 
a. This option involves applying two different policies (load balancing and filtering based on source prefix or destination port) simultaneously to the traffic, which is an example of parallel composition.
b. MAC learning is a single process that is conditioned by whether the traffic is blocked by the firewall rule or not. This is more of a sequential operation than a parallel composition.
c. Counting traffic is a single action applied to port 80 traffic, which does not imply parallel composition with another policy or action.
d. Blocking traffic from certain IP addresses is a single policy action and does not inherently involve parallel composition with another policy.
e. This option describes applying load balancing and then routing the traffic to the chosen destination IP address. The two policies are applied in parallel to the traffic, which is an example of parallel composition.
Therefore, the correct answers are options a and e, which describe scenarios where multiple network functions are applied to traffic in parallel.","['https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/parallel-composition', 'https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-sdnrg-layer-terminology-01.txt']",0,12_programming_SDNs,0.95,0.6237178941785427

To find the number of bits needed for 90 subnets, we can use the formula 2^n >= number of subnets, where n is the number of bits. 2^7 = 128, which is the smallest power of 2 greater than 90, so we need 7 bits for subnetting.

",,b,b,,"CIDR notation /22 indicates that the first 22 bits of the IP address are used for the network part. This leaves 10 bits for host addresses. The network mask in decimal notation for a /22 prefix is 255.255.252.0, which corresponds to the first 22 bits set to 1, and the remaining 10 bits set to 0. The binary representation of the mask is 11111111.11111111.11111100.00000000, which converts to 255.255.252.0 in dotted decimal notation.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing', 'https://www.iplocation.net/subnet-mask']",1,grad_TCP,1,0.9999958726752174

",,b,b,,"CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) aggregation, also known as supernetting, combines multiple networks into a single larger network. The goal is to have a contiguous block of IP addresses that can be represented by a single CIDR notation. For the addresses 128.58.24.0/24, 128.58.25.0/24, 128.58.26.0/24, and 128.58.27.0/24, we can see that the first three octets are the same and the fourth octet is sequential, which allows for aggregation. By combining these four /24 networks, we create a larger /22 network. The new subnet mask /22 means that the first 22 bits are the network portion, which in this case are 128.58.24.0/22, covering all four original networks from 128.58.24.0 to 128.58.27.255. Therefore, the correct CIDR outcome is 128.58.24.0/22, which is option b.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/classless-inter-domain-routing-cidr/', 'https://www.practicalnetworking.net/stand-alone/cidr-notatation/']",1,grad_TCP,1,0.9992183138059585
