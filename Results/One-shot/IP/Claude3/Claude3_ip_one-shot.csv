",,"a,c","a,c",,"The correct answers are A and C. When an IP address is configured on a router interface, the router will add two routes to its routing table: a connected route for the subnet that the interface belongs to, and a local route (also called a host route) for the specific IP address configured on the interface. In this case, with IP address 10.1.1.100/26, the interface belongs to subnet 10.1.1.64/26 (or 10.1.1.64 255.255.255.192). So the router will have a connected route for 10.1.1.64/26. The router will also have a local route to the specific IP 10.1.1.100/32 (or 10.1.1.100 255.255.255.255), which is the IP configured on the interface itself.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/iproute_pi/configuration/xe-3s/iri-xe-3s-book/iri-conn-route.html']",1,chapter5_ipv4_routing,0.95,1
