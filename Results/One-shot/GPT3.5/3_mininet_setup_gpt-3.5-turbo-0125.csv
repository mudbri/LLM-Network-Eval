16,Which of the following command is used to generate an OpenFlow network topology consisting of a single switch and 8 hosts with randomly generated MAC addresses for each host?,"a. sudo mn --topo single,8  --switch ovsk --controller remote
b. sudo mn --topo single,3 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
c. sudo mn --topo single,8 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
d. sudo mn --topo linear,8  --switch ovsk --controller remote
",,a,c,,"The correct command to generate an OpenFlow network topology consisting of a single switch and 8 hosts with randomly generated MAC addresses for each host is 'sudo mn --topo single,8 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote'. This command specifies a single switch with 8 hosts, includes the '--mac' flag for randomly generated MAC addresses, and sets the switch type to 'ovsk' with a remote controller.",['https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Introduction-to-Mininet#creating-topologies'],0,3_mininet_setup,1,0.9971854173856285
17,What is the purpose of --mac flag used in mininet?,"a. Generates random MAC addresses for the hosts.
b. Generates sequential MAC addresses for the hosts, matching their IP address.
c. Generates sequential MAC addresses for the switch ports, matching their IP address.
d. Generates random MAC addresses for the switch ports.
",,b,a,,"The --mac flag in Mininet is used to generate random MAC addresses for the hosts, not sequential ones. This randomness helps avoid conflicts and ensures uniqueness in the network setup.",['https://github.com/mininet/mininet/issues/647'],0,3_mininet_setup,0.9,0.9999804955832136
20,"What is the purpose of dpctl, provided with mininet?","a. To enable visibility and control over a single switchâ€™s flow table.
b. To enable visibility and control over multiple switch flow table.
c. Is an OpenFlow controller.
",,a,a,,"The purpose of dpctl in Mininet is to provide visibility and control over a single switch's flow table. It allows users to interact with the switch's data plane directly, viewing and modifying flow entries.",['https://github.com/mininet/mininet/blob/master/util/dpctl'],1,3_mininet_setup,0.9,0.9999801379802525
