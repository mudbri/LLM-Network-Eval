pool examsdigest: netmask 255.255.255.240
start 190.1.1.1 end 190.1.1.10
type generic, total addresses 10, allocated 10 (100%), misses 595""
You are responsible to find out why users are not being able to reach the Internet.","a. The cause is not related to dynamic NAT
b. The command output does not provide any clue to identify the problem
c. Dynamic NAT can't use Standard ACLs
d. The NAT pool does not have enough entries to fulfill the user's requests
",,d,d,,"The correct answer is D. The output shows that the NAT pool has a total of 10 addresses, all of which are already allocated (100% allocated). Since the NAT pool is fully allocated, new users trying to reach the Internet will not be able to do so because there are no more available addresses in the pool to NAT their traffic.",['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipaddr_nat/configuration/15-mt/nat-15-mt-book/iadnat-dyn-nat-consv.html'],1,chapter11_ip_services,0.9,0.9999984951481323

201,"R1 and R2 are attached to the same Ethernet VLAN, with subnet 192.168.1.0/24, and addresses 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2 respectively. The routers use an FHRP. Host A and host B attach to the same LAN and have correct default router settings per the FHRP configuration. Which of the following statements is true for this LAN?","a. You can't connect two routers to the same LAN subnet.
b. If one router fails, hosts can't send packets off-subnet
c. If one router fails, both hosts will use the one remaining router as a default router
d. if one router fails, only one of the two hosts will still be able to send packets off-subnet
",,c,c,,"Option C is correct. In this scenario where R1 and R2 are attached to the same Ethernet VLAN with an FHRP (First Hop Redundancy Protocol) configured, such as HSRP or VRRP, if one router fails, both hosts will use the one remaining router as the default gateway. FHRP ensures redundancy by providing a virtual IP address shared between the routers, allowing seamless failover in case one router becomes unavailable.",['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5000/sw/configuration/guide/cli/CLIConfigurationGuide/First_Hop_Redundancy_Protocols.html'],1,chapter11_ip_services,0.9,0.987495600901573
