211,Your company plans to start using public cloud service and now you are considering different WAN options. Your main concern is security by keeping the data private while also providing good QoS services. Which of the following options are under consideration? (Choose two answers.),"a. Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider
b. Using an Internet connection without VPN
c. Using an Internet connection with VPN
d. Using an intercloud exchange
",,"a,d","a,c",,"Options A and C are the correct choices. Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider ensures a dedicated and secure connection, maintaining data privacy. This method offers good QoS services as the connection is not shared with other internet traffic. Using an Internet connection with VPN also provides security by encrypting the data transmitted over the public internet, thus keeping it private. VPNs can prioritize traffic to ensure good QoS services.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-wan/', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/vpn-endpoint-security-clients/index.html']",0,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,0.9999993743675457

Which of the following are true about the Layer 3 details most likely used with this service and design? (Choose all that apply)","a. The WAN uses one IP subnet
b. The WAN uses 20 or more IP subnets
c. A remote site router would have one OSPF neighbor
d. A remote site router would have 20 OSPF neighbors
",,"a,d","a,c",,"A is correct because in an Ethernet LAN (E-LAN) service, all sites are typically part of a single broadcast domain, so they usually use one IP subnet for simplicity. C is correct as each router in OSPF forms adjacencies with its directly connected neighbors, so a remote site router would have one OSPF neighbor, which is the router connected to the service at that site.",['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/iproute_ospf/configuration/xe-16/iro-xe-16-book/ospf-overview.html'],0,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.9,0.9985440267290266
