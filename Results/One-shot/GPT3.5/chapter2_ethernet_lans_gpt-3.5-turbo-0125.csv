28,A Layer 2 switch configuration places all its physical ports into VLAN 2. The IP addressing plan shows that address 175.28.1.150 (with mask 255.255.255.0) is reserved for use by this new LAN switch and that 175.28.1.254 is already configured on the router connected to that same VLAN. The switch needs to support SSH connections into the switch from any subnet in the network. Which of the following commands are part of the required configuration in this case? (Choose two answers.),"a. The switch cannot support SSH because all its ports connect to VLAN 2, and the IP address must be configured on interface VLAN 1.
b. The ip address 175.28.1.150 255.255.255.0 command in interface vlan 2 configuration mode.
