25,What could be the operational steps behind the AT&T's IRSCP (a commercial version of the Routing Control Platform) for detecting malicious traffic? Select all that apply.,"a. The controller sees all traffic passing through the network, detects an attack, and installs a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where the attack traffic is originating.
b. The end host changes its IP address so that it is no longer the target of the attack traffic.
c. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to re-route traffic through a deep-packet inspection device.
d. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to install a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where attack traffic is originating.
e. A victim end host sends an alert to an on-path firewall about the source and nature of an attack, at which point the firewall installs a null route to drop the traffic at the entry point where the attack is originating.

c. Incorrect security policies.
d. Incorrect operation when one controller fails.
e. Forwarding loops.
",,"c,e","a,b,d",,"a. A flood of traffic at the controller can occur due to inconsistencies between multiple controller replicas, causing an increased load on the controllers as they try to synchronize state information. This is a problem arising from consistency issues in the control plane with multiple replicas.
