42,Why does the formula for the number of hosts per subnet (2H â€“ 2) require the subtraction of two hosts?,"a. To reserve two addresses for redundant default gateways(routers)
b. To reserve the two addresses required for DHCP operation
c. To reserve addresses for the subnet broadcast address and subnet ID
d. To reserve addresses for the subnet ID and default gateway (router)
",,c,c,,"The correct answer is C. The formula for the number of hosts per subnet (2^H - 2) subtracts two because it reserves addresses for the subnet broadcast address and subnet ID. The subnet ID is the address used to identify the specific subnet, and the broadcast address is used to send data to all hosts in that subnet. These two addresses are reserved and not assigned to individual hosts, hence the subtraction of two from the total number of possible host addresses in the subnet.",['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork'],1,chapter3_ipv4_addressing,0.95,0.993853657519364
