95,What are some benefits to using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Host configuration is simpler, since all hosts are visible from a single large Ethernet topology.
b. Forwarding on physical MAC addresses is simpler, since both the data center network topology and hosts' physical MAC addresses are hierarchical.
c. IP routing does not need to be reconfigured when physical or virtual machines move from one part of the network to another.
d. Scaling problems are simpler, since all hosts are configured on a single, flat topology.
e. Load balancing is easier on a layer-2 topology than on a layer 3 topology.
",,"a,c","a,b,c",,"a. Using a layer-2 MAC topology makes host configuration simpler as hosts are all visible from a single large Ethernet topology, reducing complexity and management overhead. 
 b. Forwarding on physical MAC addresses is simpler in a layer-2 MAC topology due to the hierarchical structure of both the network topology and hosts' physical MAC addresses. 
 c. In a layer-2 MAC topology, IP routing does not need reconfiguration when physical or virtual machines move within the network, enhancing flexibility and reducing operational overhead. 
 Options d and e are incorrect because scaling problems can arise with a single flat layer-2 topology, and load balancing may be more challenging in layer-2 compared to layer-3 topologies.",['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/data-center-virtualization/application-centric-infrastructure/white-paper-c11-734907.html'],0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,0.6908001787166241
96,"In PortLand, what are the reasons for assigning hosts pseudo-MAC addresses, as opposed to simply forwarding traffic on physical MAC addresses? Select all that apply.","a. Hosts in the data-center network topology are more vulnerable to attack if they expose their actual physical MAC addresses, rather than having a layer of indirection.
b. It is very difficult to load balance traffic using physical MAC addresses; pseudo MAC addresses make it possible to assign traffic to destination IP addresses.
c. Without pseudo-MAC addresses, switches would have to update forwarding state whenever hosts with a particular MAC address moved from one portion of the topology to another.
d. Forwarding loops are be more common in a flat layer-2 topology than they are in a topology with hierarchical pseudo MAC addresses.
e. In a flat layer-2 topology, switches cannot know on which port to forward traffic without maintaining switch tables for each MAC address, since MAC addresses are flat, not hierarchical.

Pseudo-MAC addresses provide this layer of indirection for security reasons. c.

Pseudo-MAC addresses help in maintaining consistent forwarding state. e. In a flat layer-2 topology, switches cannot know on which port to forward traffic without maintaining switch tables for each MAC address, since MAC addresses are flat, not hierarchical.

97,What are the steps involved in the Proxy ARP process that PortLand's Fabric Manager runs?,"a. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns returns PMAC directly to the end host.

98,"What are some of the disadvantages of today's interdomain routing protocol, BGP? Select all that apply.","a. ISPs cannot load-balance traffic across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix.
b. Routing and forwarding decisions are only based on IP prefix, not on a broader range of traffic flow attributes.
c. ISPs can only influence route selection through indirect mechanisms (e.g., prepending), rather than directly manipulating the forwarding table entries in switches.
d. ISPs cannot express preference of one route over another, given multiple routes to a destination.
e. ISPs can only influence the routing decisions of their immediate neighbor, not the entire end-to-end path.
",,"b,c,e","a,b,c,d,e",,"a. BGP does not support load-balancing traffic across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix effectively. It usually selects a single best path based on its attributes. Load balancing is limited in BGP.
b. BGP makes routing decisions based on the destination IP prefix only, lacking the ability to consider a broader range of traffic flow attributes that could lead to more efficient routing.
c. ISPs can influence route selection indirectly in BGP, for example, by prepending AS numbers, but they cannot directly manipulate the forwarding table entries in switches, limiting their control over routing decisions.
d. BGP lacks the ability to express a preference for one route over another when multiple routes to a destination exist. It primarily selects the best path based on its own criteria.
e.
