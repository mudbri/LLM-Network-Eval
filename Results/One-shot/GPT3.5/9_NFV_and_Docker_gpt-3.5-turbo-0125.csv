72,"In NFV, which of the following is the function of steering?","a. Finding the best location to place a single network function in an enterprise or wide area network.
b. Installing custom packet processing code on servers in the network.
c. Placing middleboxes at places throughout the network to minimize network load.
d. Installing custom packet processing code on switches in the network.
e. Installing flow table entries in switches to forward traffic through network functions or middleboxes that are installed in the network
",,e,e,,"In NFV (Network Function Virtualization), the function of steering involves installing flow table entries in switches to direct traffic through network functions or middleboxes that are deployed in the network. This allows for intelligent routing and processing of traffic based on the defined rules in the flow tables.",['https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/network-function-virtualization'],1,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.95,0.999977753956447
74,What are some advantages of Docker containers over virtual machines? Select all that apply.,"a. Containers can be connected to build a virtual network, whereas virtual machines cannot.
b. Performance in containers may be better since they invoke OS system calls directly, rather than through an emulated machine.
c. Containers require less storage and memory per-instance, and require less time to instantiate than virtual machines.
d. Containers provide more flexibility in the choice of operating system.
e. Containers provide better isolation than virtual machines.
",,"b,c","b,c,e",,"a. Containers can be connected to build a virtual network, which is also possible with virtual machines, so this is not a unique advantage of containers over virtual machines. 
b. Performance in containers may be better due to invoking OS system calls directly, enhancing efficiency compared to virtual machines that need to go through an emulated machine. 
c. Containers require less storage and memory per-instance, and they are faster to instantiate than virtual machines, making them more resource-efficient. 
d. Virtual machines provide more flexibility in the choice of operating system, not containers. 
e. Containers provide better isolation than virtual machines, as they share the host OS kernel, making them more lightweight and efficient in resource usage.","['https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container', 'https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/whats-a-linux-container']",0,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.9,0.764331847582861
75,Which of the following commands is used to instantiate a new Docker container by invoking a command in that container?,"a. docker stop
b. docker attach
c. docker commit
d. docker pull
e. docker run
",,e,e,,The command 'docker run' is used to create and start a new container. It allows you to specify the image to use for the container and the command to run inside the container.,['https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/'],1,9_NFV_and_Docker,1,0.9999703635211691
76,Which of the following is true about networking Docker containers? Select all that apply.,"a. Docker containers can be networked to each other via the native Docker bridge or Open vSwitch.
b. A Docker container can never expose a low port (e.g., port 80) to the external Internet; Internet hosts must always reach a Docker service by a high port (e.g., 8080).
c. Docker containers running in different virtual machines cannot be networked together.
d. Connecting Docker containers requires setting up GRE tunnels between the containers.
e. Docker containers are not reachable from the external Internet by default.
",,"a,e","a,e",,"a. Docker containers can be networked to each other using the native Docker bridge or through plugins like Open vSwitch. This allows containers to communicate with each other securely and efficiently. e. By default, Docker containers are not reachable from the external Internet for security reasons. Specific configurations are needed to expose container services to the external network.",['https://docs.docker.com/network/'],1,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.9,0.9993586567985261
