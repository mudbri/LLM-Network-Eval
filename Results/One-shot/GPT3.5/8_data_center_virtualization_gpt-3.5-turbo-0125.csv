62,Which of the following are true of “network slicing”? Select all that apply.,"a. Network operators can use slicing to test configurations on “shadow” networks that mirror a production network topology.
b. One way to slice networks is according to “flow space”, whereby different controllers might control distinct and non-overlapping traffic flows.
c. A controller can prevent one network slice from interfering with the resources of another.
d. Multi-tenant datacenters are one use case for network slicing.
e. Conventional (i.e., non-SDN) networks have no concept of network virtualization or slicing.
",,"a,b,d","a,b,c,d",,"a. Network slicing allows operators to create isolated virtual networks for testing without affecting the production environment. This enables testing configurations safely.
b. Slicing based on flow space is a valid method where controllers manage specific traffic flows separately, ensuring isolation and control over different types of data.
c. Controllers in network slicing can enforce boundaries between slices, ensuring that one slice's activities do not impact another slice's resources or operations.
d. Multi-tenant datacenters benefit from network slicing by providing isolated virtual networks to different tenants, enhancing security and resource management.
Option e is incorrect because network slicing is a concept that extends to SDN, offering virtualization and isolation capabilities.","['https://www.sdxcentral.com/sdn/definitions/what-is-network-slicing/', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/network-slicing']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,0.8284566863421589
63,Which of the following are true about flow spaces? Select all that apply.,"a. Two flow spaces cannot overlap.
b. One host could send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces.
c. Flow spaces can only be defined according to combinations of packet header fields.
d. Flowspace isolation separates individual virtual networks from one another but incurs some performance penalty for doing so.
e. Two controllers that write data-plane rules for non-overlapping parts of flowspace can never cause traffic from one “slice” to enter the other slice.
",,b,"b,d",,"b. One host could send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces is true because a single host can generate traffic that matches the criteria for multiple flow spaces, leading to packets being classified into different flow spaces. This is a common scenario in Software Defined Networking (SDN) environments. 
 d. Flowspace isolation does separate individual virtual networks from one another but can incur a performance penalty due to the need for additional processing to enforce the isolation. This trade-off between isolation and performance is a consideration in SDN deployments. 
 Therefore, the correct statements are options b and d.",['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915007106'],0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.95,0.9797472397565609
64,Which of the following describe the control-plane checks that FlowVisor implements? Select all that apply.,"a. When a packet must be forwarded to a controller, Flowvisor forwards traffic to the correct controller based on which controller “owns” the flowspace corresponding to that packet.
b. Flowvisor prevents each slice's controller from being the target of a denial of service attack from other slices.
c. Flowvisor can only instantiate network slices based on the network topology, not based on other properties, such as application traffic.
d. Flowvisor prevents a controller from writing data-plane rules to a part of flowspace that it does not own.
e. Flowvisor installs traffic shaping and quality of service rules to ensure that each network slice has guaranteed resources.
",,"a,d","a,b,d",,"a. FlowVisor forwards traffic to the correct controller based on the controller that 'owns' the corresponding flowspace, which is a control-plane check. This ensures proper flow handling by the respective controller. 
b. FlowVisor prevents each slice's controller from being the target of a denial of service attack from other slices. This is a security mechanism implemented in the control plane to protect controllers, making it a control-plane check. 
d. FlowVisor restricts controllers from writing data-plane rules to parts of the flowspace they do not own.
