b. MAC address
c. ARP address
d. Routing table
e. Destination IP address
f. ARP table
",,"a,b","a,b",,"In a spoofing attack, the two commonly spoofed parameters are the Source IP address and MAC address. By spoofing the source IP address, attackers can deceive the recipient about the origin of the packet. Spoofing the MAC address allows attackers to manipulate the Layer 2 communication.
