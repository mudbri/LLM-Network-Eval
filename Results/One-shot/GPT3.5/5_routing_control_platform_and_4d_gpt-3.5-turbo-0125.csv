32,What are some of the reasons that it is difficult to deploy improvements to BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. Changes are necessarily incremental because of the large installed base of routers that already run BGP.
b. BGP is implemented in hardware, so deploying changes to BGP requires changes on the timescale of hardware development cycles.
c. Deplyoing changes to BGP requires coordination across potentially tens of thousands of ASes in the Internet.
d. Only a few vendors implement BGP, and deploying changes requires convincing those vendors to change the protocol.
e. Deploying changes requires coordination in standards bodies such as the IETF.
",,"a,c,e","a,c,d,e",,"a. Changes to BGP are typically incremental due to the vast number of routers already running the protocol, making it challenging to introduce radical changes without disrupting existing infrastructure. This incremental nature slows down the deployment of improvements. c. Deploying changes to BGP, being a core routing protocol on the Internet, necessitates coordination across numerous Autonomous Systems (ASes) that use BGP for routing, making it complex and time-consuming. d. BGP implementations are primarily controlled by a few vendors, so convincing these vendors to adopt changes can be a significant barrier to deploying improvements. e. Since BGP is a standardized protocol, any modifications or improvements need to go through the standardization process in bodies like the IETF, adding another layer of complexity and time to the deployment process.",['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/116146-technote-bgp-00.html'],0,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.95,0.6870116043797401
33,Which of the following are true about the RCP? Select all that apply.,"a. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, the RCP controller for an AS sees all routes for all destinations that an AS learns from neighboring ASes.
b. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, there is no need for ASes to use BGP to exchange routes.
c. In an RCP deployment, routers no longer have to compute routes.
d. The RCP controller operates just like a route reflector would, selecting a single best route for each destination for all client routers.
e. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, a single AS can benefit from deploying RCP even if no other ASes deploy RCP.
",,"c,e","a,d,e",,"a. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, the RCP controller for an AS sees all routes for all destinations that an AS learns from neighboring ASes, which is a characteristic of RCP operation. This allows the controller to have a global view of the network's routing information. 
d. The RCP controller operates similarly to a route reflector, selecting the best route for each destination for all client routers. This centralized decision-making is a key feature of RCP. 
e. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, a single AS can benefit from deploying RCP even if no other ASes deploy RCP.

34,"Which of the following are true about network management with BGP, in the absence of RCP? Select all that apply.","a. BGP's interaction with the underlying routing IGP routing protocol can result in persistent forwarding loops.
b. Implementing network-wide policy sometimes causes the routers themeselves to have to carry state.
c. Each router operates and makes decisions based only on a local view of network state.
d. BGP routing has a single point of failure.
e. It is not possible to perform traffic engineering with conventional BGP.
",,"a,b,c","b,c",,"b. Implementing network-wide policy sometimes causes the routers themselves to have to carry state is true. In the absence of RCP, each router needs to maintain its own view of the network state to make decisions based on local information. This can lead to increased state information at individual routers.
c. Each router operates and makes decisions based only on a local view of network state is true. Without RCP, BGP routers do not have a global view of the network. They base their decisions on the information they have locally, which can lead to suboptimal routing decisions.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/13753-25.html', 'https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cse567-06/ftp/bgp/']",0,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.9,0.9805814296505141
35,Which of the following is true about the second phase of RCP deployment? Select all that apply.,"a. The second phase of RCP deployment requires no coordination with neighboring ASes.
b. The second phase of RCP deployment offers potential benefits such as reduced routing table size.
c. In the second phase of deployment, the RCP controller sees all routes for every destination that neighboring ASes advertise.
d. The second phase of deployment requires fewer BGP sessions at the RCP controller than the first phase, thus improving scalability of the controller.
e. In the second phase of RCP deployment, ASes do not need to use BGP to exchange routes with one another.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"a. The second phase of RCP deployment does require coordination with neighboring ASes to exchange routing information effectively. Therefore, option a is incorrect. 
 b. The second phase of RCP deployment does offer potential benefits such as reduced routing table size by allowing the RCP controller to aggregate routes. 
 c. In the second phase of deployment, the RCP controller does see all routes for every destination that neighboring ASes advertise to effectively compute the best routes. 
 d. The statement about fewer BGP sessions and scalability improvement is more related to the first phase of RCP deployment, not the second phase.
