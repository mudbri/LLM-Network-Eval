1,Which of the following are true about Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)? Select all that apply.,"a. The only sizes for an IP address allocation before CIDR were 8, 16, or 24 bits.
b. The prefix length for a CIDR prefix can be anywhere in the range from 0 to 32 bits.
c. In an Internet forwarding table with CIDR, there can only be one unique matching entry for any given IP address.
d. CIDR slowed the rate of Internet routing table growth because prefixes no longer had to be allocated in fixed-size blocks.
",,"b,d","b,d",,"a. The statement is incorrect. Before CIDR, IP address allocations were based on classes (Class A, B, C) with fixed sizes of 8, 16, or 24 bits. CIDR introduced variable-length subnet masks (VLSM) allowing prefixes of any length from 0 to 32 bits. This makes option a incorrect.
 b. The prefix length for a CIDR prefix can indeed be anywhere in the range from 0 to 32 bits, enabling more flexible subnetting.
 c. In an Internet forwarding table with CIDR, there can be multiple matching entries for different prefixes of varying lengths, allowing for more specific routing entries.
 d. CIDR did help slow down the rate of Internet routing table growth because it allowed for more efficient allocation of address space by breaking the rigid class-based addressing and enabling allocation in variable-length blocks.",['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-cidr/'],1,1_SDN_Basics,1,0.9950770519261892
2,Which of the following are true about how DNS lookups work? Select all that apply.,"a. A DNS A-record query for google.com will only return a single IP address at a time.
b. An NS-record query for a DNS lookup will return the name(s) of the authoritative name server(s) for that domain.
c. If your local DNS resolver caches an NS record for google.com for multiple days, all clients who use that DNS resolver will continue using the same IP address to reach Google’s Web server until that NS record expires.
d. An MX-record query for a DNS lookup will return the IP address of the mail server for that domain.
e. All DNS PTR records are maintained by a single organization in-addr.arpa.
",,b,"b,c",,"b. An NS-record query for a DNS lookup will indeed return the name(s) of the authoritative name server(s) for that domain, allowing the resolver to know where to direct further queries for that domain's records. This is a standard part of the DNS resolution process. 
c. If a local DNS resolver caches an NS record for a domain like google.com, clients using that resolver will continue to be directed to the IP address associated with that domain until the cached record expires. This behavior is typical in DNS caching mechanisms.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-lookup/', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-lookup/how-dns-lookups-work/']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.5193344069104643
3,Which of the following are true about traffic control with BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
b. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
c. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
d. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
",,"a,b","a,b",,"a. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control outbound traffic by influencing the best path selection within the local AS, affecting traffic leaving the AS. This attribute is not used for inbound traffic control.
b. BGP AS path prepending is used by a network operator to control inbound traffic by making the path through their AS less preferred, thus diverting traffic away from that path. This technique is commonly used for inbound traffic engineering.
c. BGP AS path prepending is typically used for inbound traffic control, not for outbound traffic control.
d. The BGP local preference attribute is not used to control inbound traffic; it is used for outbound traffic control within the AS.",['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/13753-25.html'],1,1_SDN_Basics,1,0.9993661068851846
4,Which of the following are true about layering? Select all that apply.,"a. The network layer guarantees reliable, in-order delivery of packets.
b. The network layer has only a single protocol in widespread use today, representing what we call the “narrow waist”.
c. The transport layer uses port numbers.
d. The destination address in the link layer header is always the address of the next layer-3 node along an end-to-end IP path.
",,"b,c","c,d",,"c. The transport layer uses port numbers for identifying different applications on a single device. This is a true statement about layering and the use of port numbers at the transport layer. 
d. The destination address in the link layer header is not always the address of the next layer-3 node along an end-to-end IP path. The link layer is responsible for node-to-node delivery, and the destination address in the link layer header is usually the address of the next node in the path, not necessarily the next layer-3 node along the path.
Therefore, the correct answers are options c and d.",['https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1122.txt'],0,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.9965321583803409
5,Which of the following are not true about packet switching? Select all that apply.,"a. Once a connection is established between two endpoints in a packet switched network, the end-to-end route cannot change, or the connection must be re-established.
b. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will always experience predictable latency.
c. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will never be dropped by intermediate nodes along the path.
d. A user of a packet switched network might occasionally get a “busy signal” if there are too many users on the network.
",,"a,b,c,d","a,b,c",,"a. Packet switching allows for dynamic routing, so the end-to-end route can adapt and change without needing to re-establish connections. This statement is not true about packet switching.
b. Latency in packet-switched networks can vary due to factors like network congestion, routing decisions, etc., leading to unpredictable latency at times. Hence, traffic may not always experience predictable latency.
c. In packet-switched networks, packets can be dropped due to congestion, buffer overflows, or other issues, so it is possible for traffic to be dropped by intermediate nodes along the path.
d. Users getting a 'busy signal' due to network congestion is more related to circuit-switched networks rather than packet-switched networks.
Therefore, options a, b, and c are not true about packet switching.",['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/packet-switching/'],0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.8830018237661337
6,Which of the following are true about content distribution networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Content distribution networks can improve the performance that a client sees by reducing the network latency between the client and the content that it is downloading.
b. Content distribution networks can reduce transit expenses for a content provider by enabling much of the provider’s content to be served from a nearby network, sometimes even from a cache that is within the client’s own network.
c. Real-time content such as video streams cannot be distributed from a content distribution network.
d. Content distribution networks typically redirect Web clients to a nearby Web cache by rewriting the IP address of packets sent from the client to the IP address of the nearby Web cache.
",,"a,b","a,b",,"a. Content distribution networks aim to improve performance by reducing network latency between clients and content, making this statement true. Latency reduction is achieved by caching content closer to end-users.
b. Content distribution networks can indeed reduce transit expenses for content providers by caching and serving content from nearby networks or even within the client's network. This reduces the load on the origin server and the transit costs associated with delivering the content over long distances.
c. This statement is false. Content distribution networks can efficiently distribute real-time content like video streams through specialized mechanisms and edge caching.
d. Content distribution networks typically use DNS-based techniques or HTTP redirection to direct clients to nearby caches; IP address rewriting is not a common method for this purpose.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/', 'https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-overview']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.9999979439254136
7,Which of the following are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control? Select all that apply.,"a. Only wireless networks can have collisions at the receiver; such collisions are not possible on wired Ethernet networks.
b. Using RTS/CTS (“request to send”, “clear to send”) control reduces the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network.
c. A wireless sender can avoid causing a collision at the receiver by performing a “carrier sense” to determine whether any other sender wants to transmit at the time that it wishes to send a packet.
d. Disabling RTS/CTS necessarily lowers the effective throughput of the wireless network, since more collisions will occur at the receiver without RTS/CTS enabled.
",,b,c,,Option c is correct. A wireless sender can indeed avoid causing a collision at the receiver by performing a 'carrier sense' to check if any other sender wants to transmit at the same time it wishes to send a packet. This mechanism helps in avoiding collisions in wireless networks.,['https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/medium-access-control-in-computer-networks/'],0,1_SDN_Basics,1,0.9913622069618311
8,Which of the following are true about video streaming? Select all that apply.,"a. Using UDP to stream a video instead of TCP is appropriate if the client is more concerned about low delay and interactivity than it does about receiving a high-quality stream.
b. A larger playout buffer at the client allows the client more time to recover from lost packets.
c. Using TCP for video streaming could result in larger delays between transmission and playout than streaming the same video with UDP.
d. Since UDP provides no reliable delivery guarantees, a video streaming application that uses UDP as its transport cannot recover from any packet loss in the video stream.
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"a. UDP is suitable for real-time applications like video streaming where low delay and interactivity are crucial, even if it means sacrificing some quality due to potential packet loss. TCP, on the other hand, focuses on reliability over speed, which might not be ideal for real-time applications. Therefore, using UDP for video streaming when low delay and interactivity are more critical is appropriate. 
 b. A larger playout buffer at the client can help in recovering from lost packets by allowing the client more time to receive retransmitted packets, reducing the chances of interruptions in the video stream playback. Therefore, a larger playout buffer benefits the client in handling lost packets. 
 c. TCP's congestion control mechanisms and reliability features can introduce additional delays in the transmission and playout of video streams compared to UDP, which is more suitable for real-time applications. Therefore, using TCP for video streaming could result in larger delays than using UDP for the same purpose.",['https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/know-how/tcp-vs-udp/'],1,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.9505572951423135
9,Which of the following are true about TCP? Select all that apply.,"a. TCP guarantees that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted.
b. A TCP sender and receiver use a “three-way handshake” both to set up and to terminate the TCP connection.
c. TCP’s congestion avoidance algorithm causes the sender to reduce its sending rate by a factor of two when it sees a packet loss.
d. A TCP sender controls its sending rate by adjusting the number of unacknowledged packets that can be sent over the network at any time.
",,"a,c,d","a,b,d",,"a. TCP ensures that data is delivered reliably and in order from sender to receiver by using sequence numbers and acknowledgments. This guarantees the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes as sent by the sender.
b. The 'three-way handshake' is used by TCP to establish a connection and also to terminate it, ensuring both ends agree to start communication.
d. TCP uses a congestion control mechanism where the sender adjusts the number of unacknowledged packets sent based on network conditions to avoid congestion and ensure reliable delivery.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-three-way-handshake/', 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-network-tcp-congestion-control/']",0,1_SDN_Basics,1,0.9982789222099162
10,Which of the following are true about denial of service attacks (and defenses)? Select all that apply.,"a. If every network on the Internet performed stateless ingress filtering to defend against source IP spoofing, the DNS reflection attack would not work.
b. If every network on the Internet performed stateless egress filtering to defend against source IP address spoofing, the DNS reflection attack could not be carried out.
c. In a “SYN Flood” attack, each TCP SYN packet that a victim receives causes it to set up TCP connection state.
d. A “DNS Reflection” attack requires the attacking client to “spoof” the source IP address of the packet containing the DNS request.
",,"b,c,d","a,d",,"a. Performing stateless ingress filtering to defend against source IP spoofing would prevent the DNS reflection attack since it relies on spoofing the source IP address to work effectively. By filtering out spoofed packets, the attack is mitigated. This statement is true. d. In a DNS Reflection attack, the attacker spoofs the source IP address of the packet containing the DNS request. This technique is crucial for the attack to succeed.
