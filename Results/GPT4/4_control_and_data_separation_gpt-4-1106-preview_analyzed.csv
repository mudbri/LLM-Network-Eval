b. Determining that a user's MAC address is authentic before allowing it to send traffic on the network.

e. Computing a shortest path routing tree.
",,"b,d,e","b,d,e",,"Control plane operations in networking are those that involve making decisions about how traffic should be handled by the network. These operations typically involve network-wide logic and state, rather than the per-packet handling that occurs in the data plane. Let's evaluate each choice:

a. Rate-limiting traffic is generally considered a data plane operation because it involves the enforcement of policies at the packet level as they traverse the network.

b. Determining that a user's MAC address is authentic is a control plane operation because it involves network policies and security measures to ensure that only valid users are allowed to send traffic.

c. Load balancing traffic across output ports based on the hash of each packet's source IP address is a data plane operation. It involves making forwarding decisions on a per-packet basis, which is typically done in the data plane.

d. Determining the forwarding path that satisfies an access control policy is a control plane function. This involves calculating and enforcing network-wide policies and routes.

e. Computing a shortest path routing tree is a classic control plane operation. It involves an algorithmic process to determine the best paths through the network for traffic to take, which is a network-wide consideration.

Therefore, the correct answers are options b, d, and e, which are all control plane operations.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/what-is-sdn.html', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/inside-sdn-architecture/']",1,4_control_and_data_separation,0.95,0.997267798259369,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0
25,What could be the operational steps behind the AT&T's IRSCP (a commercial version of the Routing Control Platform) for detecting malicious traffic? Select all that apply.,"a. The controller sees all traffic passing through the network, detects an attack, and installs a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where the attack traffic is originating.
b. The end host changes its IP address so that it is no longer the target of the attack traffic.
c. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to re-route traffic through a deep-packet inspection device.
d. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to install a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where attack traffic is originating.
e. A victim end host sends an alert to an on-path firewall about the source and nature of an attack, at which point the firewall installs a null route to drop the traffic at the entry point where the attack is originating.
",,"c,d","a,c,d",,"The AT&T's IRSCP (Integrated Routing and Service Control Point), which is a commercial version of the Routing Control Platform, is designed to enhance network management and security. Here’s an analysis of each option based on what such a system might do to detect and mitigate malicious traffic:

a. The controller, as part of a software-defined networking (SDN) system, could indeed see all the traffic and have the capability to detect an attack. Upon detection, the controller can install a null route to drop the malicious traffic at the entry point, preventing it from traversing the network. This is a plausible step for such a system.

b. This option is less likely to be a direct function of IRSCP, as changing the IP address of the end host is typically not a network control function but rather an action that might be taken by the end host itself or its administrator.

c. A measurement system, which could be part of or integrated with the IRSCP, may detect an attack and identify its entry point. The system could then instruct a controller to re-route the suspicious traffic for further inspection, such as through a deep-packet inspection device. This is a common mitigation strategy in advanced network management systems.

d. Similar to option (a), a measurement system could detect an attack and instruct a controller to install a null route. This is another plausible operational step for a system designed to control routing based on detected threats.

e. This option suggests that the victim end host directly communicates with a firewall to manage the attack traffic.

(a) Improved interdomain routing security: With SDN, security policies can be more dynamically and centrally enforced, improving the security of routing between domains. 

(b) Customer-controlled egress selection: SDN enables customers to have more control over their traffic flows, including the selection of egress points, due to the centralized control plane. 

(c) Improved logging capabilities: While SDN can potentially improve logging by centralizing the control of network devices, logging capabilities are not inherently dependent on the separation of control and data planes. Better logging can be achieved with other technologies and does not necessarily become easier solely because of this separation.

b. Easier configuration/administration, since there is no need to number hosts or configure subnets. - This is correct. Layer-2 forwarding simplifies configuration and administration because it does not require IP addressing and subnetting as Layer-3 does.

c. Better security properties. - This is generally not true. Layer-2 networks are prone to certain types of attacks, such as ARP spoofing and MAC flooding, which do not apply to Layer-3 networks. Security is not inherently better at Layer-2.

d. Better scaling properties. - This can be true in the context of overlay networks like VXLAN, which allow for better scalability in large data center environments by extending Layer-2 networks over Layer-3 infrastructure.

b. The control plane allows traffic to be forwarded using Layer 2 addresses, thus allowing automatic load balance across the topology.

a. True. The separation allows for more dynamic network configurations, which facilitates the migration of virtual machines without the need to renumber or reassign network services to different IP addresses. This is because the control logic is abstracted from the underlying hardware, enabling more flexible management of network resources.

d. True. With a centralized control plane, all routing decisions and network policies can be managed from a single point, which simplifies monitoring and control over the network.

b. False. While SDN can enable more intelligent traffic forwarding, the statement about using Layer 2 addresses for automatic load balancing is not directly related to the separation of the control and data planes. Load balancing can be achieved through various means and is not inherently a result of this separation.

c. False. The separation of control and data planes does not necessarily mean fewer switches are used. The number of switches in a data center topology is determined by the size and design of the network, not just by the separation of planes.

a. Running a consistency protocol across controller replicas is a common approach to ensure that all replicas have a consistent view of the network state. This can be done through various consensus algorithms like Raft or Paxos.

b. Keeping a 'hot spare' replica implies having a backup controller that can quickly take over in case the primary controller fails. This replica would have a complete view of the network state and can help in maintaining consistency during failovers.

c. Only keeping a subset of the network state in memory at any time does not directly address the issue of inconsistency across replicas. Instead, it may actually contribute to inconsistency if different replicas hold different subsets of the network state.

d. Using different controllers for independent parts of the network can help in reducing the scope of inconsistency as each controller manages a separate domain. However, it does not eliminate the need for consistency within each domain.

e. Having multiple controllers install forwarding table entries on the same router and resolving the conflict on the router itself would likely lead to inconsistency and unpredictable network behavior, as routers are not designed to resolve conflicts that are meant to be managed by controllers.
