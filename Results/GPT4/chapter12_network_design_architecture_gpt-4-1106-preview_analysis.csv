211,Your company plans to start using public cloud service and now you are considering different WAN options. Your main concern is security by keeping the data private while also providing good QoS services. Which of the following options are under consideration? (Choose two answers.),"a.

",,"a,d","a,c",,"When considering the use of public cloud services with a focus on security and QoS, the following options are viable: a) Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider. This option, often referred to as a direct connect service provided by cloud vendors, establishes a private connection between the data center and the cloud provider, ensuring data privacy and potentially better QoS. c) Using an Internet connection with VPN.

d.

This is because E-LAN service provides full-mesh connectivity between all locations, mimicking a LAN over a metropolitan area. Therefore, option 'a' is correct. Since all sites seem to be on the same LAN, each router would only need to form an OSPF adjacency with the headquarters router, not with every other site's router. This means a remote site router would typically have one OSPF neighbor, which is the headquarters router that appears to be on the same LAN segment, making option 'c' also correct.
