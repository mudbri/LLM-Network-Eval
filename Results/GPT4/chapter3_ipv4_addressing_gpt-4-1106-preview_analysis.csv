The last subnet in this space would begin at 9.255.0.0 and end at 9.255.255.255. The last usable address for a host in this subnet would be the one just before the broadcast address, which is 9.255.255.254. Options b, c, and d are incorrect because they are outside the 9.0.0.0 network range.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classful_network', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork', 'https://www.ripe.net/about-us/press-centre/understanding-ip-addressing']",1,chapter3_ipv4_addressing,1.0,0.999990150939502,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0

- 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix)
- 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix)

Based on these ranges:
- 172.31.100.0 falls within the 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 range, making it a private network.
- 192.168.1.0 falls within the 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 range, making it a private network.
- 172.24.0.0 also falls within the 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 range, making it a private network.
