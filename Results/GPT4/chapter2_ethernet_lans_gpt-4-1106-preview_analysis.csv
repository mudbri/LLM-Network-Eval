28,A Layer 2 switch configuration places all its physical ports into VLAN 2. The IP addressing plan shows that address 175.28.1.150 (with mask 255.255.255.0) is reserved for use by this new LAN switch and that 175.28.1.254 is already configured on the router connected to that same VLAN. The switch needs to support SSH connections into the switch from any subnet in the network. Which of the following commands are part of the required configuration in this case? (Choose two answers.),"a. The switch cannot support SSH because all its ports connect to VLAN 2, and the IP address must be configured on interface VLAN 1.

e. The ip default-gateway 175.28.1.150 command in global configuration mode.",,"b,c","b,c",,"In order to configure a Layer 2 switch to support SSH connections, the switch needs to have an IP address assigned to a VLAN interface for management purposes, and it should know the default gateway to reach networks that are not directly connected.

Therefore, the command to assign the IP address to VLAN 2 is 'ip address 175.28.1.150 255.255.255.0' in interface VLAN 2 configuration mode. Additionally, to reach other subnets, the switch must be configured with a default gateway using the 'ip default-gateway 175.28.1.254' command in global configuration mode. Option 'a' is incorrect because the IP address does not have to be on VLAN 1; it should be on the VLAN that is used for management.
