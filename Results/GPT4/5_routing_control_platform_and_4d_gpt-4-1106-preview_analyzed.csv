32,What are some of the reasons that it is difficult to deploy improvements to BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. Changes are necessarily incremental because of the large installed base of routers that already run BGP.
b. BGP is implemented in hardware, so deploying changes to BGP requires changes on the timescale of hardware development cycles.
c. Deplyoing changes to BGP requires coordination across potentially tens of thousands of ASes in the Internet.
d. Only a few vendors implement BGP, and deploying changes requires convincing those vendors to change the protocol.
e. Deploying changes requires coordination in standards bodies such as the IETF.
",,"a,c,e","a,c,e",,"The deployment of improvements to Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is indeed challenging for several reasons. Firstly, BGP has a large installed base of routers, and any changes need to be incremental to ensure compatibility and stability across the network. This is why option (a) is correct. Secondly, changes to BGP require coordination across a vast number of Autonomous Systems (ASes), which makes the process complex and time-consuming, supporting option (c). Lastly, the coordination in standards bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is necessary to ensure that any changes to BGP are standardized and agreed upon by the broader internet community, making option (e) correct. Option (b) is incorrect because BGP is not implemented in hardware; it is a routing protocol that runs on routers, which are generally programmable and can be updated with new software. Option (d) is incorrect because there are more than a few vendors that implement BGP, and convincing them is just one part of the challenge; the actual deployment is more about coordination and compatibility with existing infrastructure.","['https://www.ietf.org/', 'https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4271', 'Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach by James F.

a. True. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, the RCP controller for an Autonomous System (AS) has visibility into all routes for all destinations that the AS learns from neighboring ASes. This comprehensive view allows the RCP to make informed routing decisions.

b. False. Even with RCP, ASes still use BGP to exchange routing information. RCP does not replace BGP but works alongside it to make more centralized routing decisions.

c. True. In an RCP deployment, the computation of routes can be offloaded from individual routers to the RCP controller. Routers still forward traffic but do not need to compute the routes themselves.

d. False. The RCP controller does not operate exactly like a route reflector. While a route reflector selects a single best route for each destination for its clients, the RCP can potentially make more individualized routing decisions for each router based on a wider array of information.

b. Implementing network-wide policy sometimes causes the routers themeselves to have to carry state.
c. Each router operates and makes decisions based only on a local view of network state.
d. BGP routing has a single point of failure.
e. It is not possible to perform traffic engineering with conventional BGP.
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"In the absence of a Routing Control Platform (RCP), traditional BGP management has several characteristics and limitations. Let's evaluate each choice:

a. BGP's interaction with the underlying IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol) can indeed result in persistent forwarding loops. This is because BGP selects routes based on policy and path attributes, without an inherent understanding of the IGP's topology, which can lead to inconsistencies between BGP and IGP routing decisions.

b. When implementing network-wide policies, routers may need to carry additional state to enforce these policies. This is because each router needs to maintain sufficient information to make policy-based routing decisions, which can increase the amount of state held on each router.

c. Each router in a BGP-managed network does indeed operate based on a local view of the network state. BGP routers exchange routing information through BGP updates, but each router's perspective is limited to the information it receives from directly connected neighbors and the policies it has configured.

d. BGP routing does not have a single point of failure as it is a distributed protocol where each router independently constructs its own routing table based on information from its neighbors. This decentralized nature is one of the strengths of BGP.

e. It is possible to perform traffic engineering with conventional BGP, although it may be more complex and less flexible compared to using an RCP or SDN-based approaches. BGP can influence traffic flows through techniques such as manipulating AS path attributes, local preference, and MED values.

This architecture can amortize system overhead in several ways. Here's how the given options align with this concept:

a. Maintaining a single table of AS paths across all BGP sessions saves memory by avoiding duplication of this information across multiple routers. This is a clear example of a centralized decision plane reducing overhead.

b. Verifying signatures on AS paths would indeed be a function of a secure BGP deployment, but it is not an example of amortizing system overhead by using a separate decision plane. This process would likely add overhead for security purposes, not reduce it.

c. Keeping track of topology information centrally in the decision plane can reduce the overhead on individual routers, which no longer need to maintain and update their own complete topology information.

d. Performing route computation centrally for all routers in the AS can greatly reduce the computational overhead on individual routers, as they no longer need to perform these computations themselves.

e. Coordinated inbound traffic engineering can optimize the use of network resources and reduce overhead by allowing the decision plane to make more informed and holistic decisions about traffic flows across multiple links.
