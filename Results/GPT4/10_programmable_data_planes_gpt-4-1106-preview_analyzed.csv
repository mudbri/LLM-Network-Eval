",,"a,b,d,e","a,b,d,e",,"The design of a fast, scalable, programmable data plane can be approached in several ways. Here's an analysis of each choice provided:

a. Make hardware routers more programmable with custom OpenFlow chips. - This is a reasonable approach as it allows for the customization and programmability of the data plane at the hardware level, which can lead to high performance and scalability.

b. Make software routers faster by reducing the need to copy packets from the kernel into user space. - This is a valid approach because copying packets between kernel space and user space introduces overhead. By optimizing this process, software routers can become faster.

c. Send all traffic through software switches running in user space. - This is not necessarily a scalable solution, as it may introduce bottlenecks due to the limitations of software switches and the overhead of running in user space.

d. Make software routers faster by distributing software routers across clusters. - This is a feasible approach to scalability and performance enhancement, as distributing the load across multiple nodes can lead to better resource utilization and higher throughput.

e. Make software routers faster by amortizing packet-processing costs across batches of packets. - Processing packets in batches is a well-known technique to improve performance by reducing per-packet overhead, thus making software routers faster.

",,"a,b,d","a,b,c,d",,"In a programmable data plane, the following functions are commonly performed: 

a. Performing deep packet inspection: Programmable data planes can inspect packet contents beyond the basic header information, enabling more sophisticated traffic management and security functions.

b. Forwarding: This is a fundamental function of any data plane, programmable or not. It involves making decisions on where to send packets next based on their headers.

c. Specifying access control policies: Programmable data planes can implement complex access control policies, allowing or denying traffic based on a wide range of criteria.

d. Shaping traffic: Data planes can shape traffic by controlling the rate at which packets are sent to ensure quality of service (QoS) and compliance with network policies.

a. This statement is false. Click elements can indeed perform common data plane operations, including TTL decrement and checksum computations. These are basic operations that any flexible packet processing software should be able to handle.

117,Why does a RouteBricks server assign one core per queue?,"a. Having multiple cores accessing the same queue would require each core to perform only one function in the packet processing pipeline, which is inefficient.
b. Having multiple cores accessing the same queue would require locking to prevent concurrent memory accesses, slowing packet forwarding performance.
c. Having multiple cores accessing the same queue might create the possibility that there is a queue that is not served by any cores.
d. Cores have heterogeneous performance, and packets are different sizes, so it makes sense to assign less powerful cores to queues that have smaller packets.
",,b,b,,"RouteBricks is a software-based router architecture that aims to exploit the parallelism possible in modern multi-core processors to increase network processing performance. When multiple cores access the same queue, there is a need for synchronization mechanisms such as locking to prevent concurrent memory accesses. These locking mechanisms can introduce significant overhead and slow down packet forwarding performance as cores may have to wait for locks to be released before they can proceed with processing packets from the queue. This is why a RouteBricks server assigns one core per queue, to eliminate the need for locking and thus improve packet forwarding performance.","[""Anwer, Muhammad, et al.

b. Large packet buffers that hold multiple packets that can be read with a single read
c. Forwarding smaller packets before larger packets
d. Avoiding lookups on the software bridge between virtual interfaces and physical interfaces
e. Batch processing
",,"a,b,d,e","b,d,e",,"To accelerate packet forwarding in software, several techniques can be utilized. Option 'b' mentions large packet buffers that hold multiple packets, which can be read with a single read operation. This approach reduces the number of I/O operations needed to process packets, thereby increasing throughput. Option 'd' suggests avoiding lookups on the software bridge between virtual interfaces and physical interfaces, which can save processing time by reducing the overhead associated with the bridging process. Option 'e' refers to batch processing, which is a technique where operations are processed in large batches rather than one at a time, improving efficiency by taking advantage of data locality and reducing per-packet processing overhead. Option 'a', Ethernet GRE tunnels, is a tunneling protocol used to encapsulate a wide variety of network layer protocols inside virtual point-to-point links over an Internet Protocol internetwork but does not directly accelerate packet forwarding.

b. False. Many current hardware platforms can forward traffic at line rates, although this may not always be optimized specifically for OpenFlow traffic.

e. Programming in C is difficult.
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"SwitchBlade is a platform designed to allow for the composition of pre-synthesized hardware data plane modules on an FPGA. The motivations behind SwitchBlade include the following:

a. Most data plane protocols involve composing only a limited number of data-plane actions. This is true because data plane functionalities are often well-defined and can be composed of reusable modules.

b. Experimental data planes may need to operate in parallel with production data planes. This is an important motivation for SwitchBlade as it allows for experimentation without disrupting production traffic.

c. Programming in Verilog (a hardware description language used for FPGAs) is difficult, which is why having pre-synthesized modules that can be composed is advantageous. It reduces the complexity of programming directly in hardware description languages.

d. The statement regarding FPGAs being lower-cost and consuming less power than conventional ASICs or OpenFlow switching chips is not universally true.
