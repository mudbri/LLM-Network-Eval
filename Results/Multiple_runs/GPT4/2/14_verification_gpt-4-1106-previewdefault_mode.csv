106,Which of the following are true about configuration verification? Select all that apply.,"a. Configuration verification can only detect errors after the configuration is installed on production routers.
b. Configuration verification cannot detect incorrect protocol behavior that may result from faulty hardware.
c. Verifying the correctness of network behavior based on configuration requires a model of protocol behavior.
d. Configuration verification requires a large-scale simulation of network protocols, complete with tests for different message orderings and timings.
e. Configuration verification cannot detect incorrect protocol behavior that may result from buggy software.
",,"b,c,e","b,c",,"Configuration verification is the process of ensuring that a network configuration will behave as expected before it is deployed. It includes checking for errors and ensuring that the configuration aligns with network policies and requirements. Here's why the selected choices are true:

b. Configuration verification is primarily focused on the correctness of the configuration itself, rather than hardware issues. It can detect errors in the configuration that may lead to incorrect behavior, but it cannot detect faults in the physical hardware that may cause incorrect protocol behavior.

c. To verify the correctness of network behavior based on configuration, it is necessary to have a model of protocol behavior. This model is used to predict how the network should behave under the given configuration and to check for any discrepancies.

The other options are not necessarily true:

a. Configuration verification can be done before the configuration is installed on production routers, not just after.

d. While large-scale simulations can be part of configuration verification, they are not a requirement for all verification processes. Some verification can be done through static analysis or smaller-scale testing.

e. Configuration verification can potentially detect incorrect protocol behavior that may result from buggy software if the verification process includes checking the software's adherence to protocol specifications.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_configuration_and_change_management', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/cloud-systems-management/configuration-professional/index.html', 'https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/concept/configuration-management-verifying.html']",0,14_verification,0.95,0.9218326019031345
107,"Which of the following assertions could be verified with configuration verification (i.e., of a snapshot of router and switch configuration)? Select all that apply.","a. A route learned from one peer will not be readvertised to another peer.
b. The current settings of link weights will result in all routers being connected.
c. The configuration of route reflectors and clients ensures that any route learned from a neighboring AS will propagate to all routers in the topology.
d. There is no traffic pattern that would ever result in a stateful firewall dropping traffic.
e. Any time that an infection occurs, hosts are automatically quarantined.
",,"a,b,c","a,c",,"Configuration verification involves examining the static configuration files of network devices to ensure that they meet certain design or policy criteria. It does not involve dynamic, real-time analysis of traffic or the behavior of the network when it is live.

a. A route learned from one peer will not be readvertised to another peer. This can be verified by examining the routing policies and filters in the configuration.

b. The current settings of link weights will result in all routers being connected. This is more about the topology and the state of the network, which configuration verification alone cannot guarantee.

c. The configuration of route reflectors and clients ensures that any route learned from a neighboring AS will propagate to all routers in the topology. This can be checked by reviewing BGP configuration and ensuring that route reflector and client relationships are properly configured.

d. There is no traffic pattern that would ever result in a stateful firewall dropping traffic. This is a statement about dynamic behavior which cannot be verified by static configuration alone.

e. Any time that an infection occurs, hosts are automatically quarantined. This involves dynamic network behavior and the response of security systems, which cannot be verified by static configuration checks.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/iproute_bgp/configuration/15-sy/irg-15-sy-book/irg-route-reflection.html', 'https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/topic-map/bgp-route-reflection.html']",0,14_verification,0.95,0.8773081307468703
108,Which of the following are true about data-plane verification? Select all that apply.,"a. Data-plane verification techniques such as header-space analysis typically operate on a single ""snapshot"" of data-plane state.
b. Data plane verification can only operate on the forwarding table of a single router or switch; network-wide analysis is not possible.
c. Data-plane verification may detect errors that configuration analysis can miss in the cases of buggy control-plane software.
d. Data-plane verification requires accurate modeling of network protocols, including which bits are present in which part of the packet header.
e. Header-space analysis can only provide verification/analysis for specific packets; it cannot answer questions for general parts of flowspace.
",,"a,c","a,c,d",,"Data-plane verification techniques, such as header-space analysis, operate on a snapshot of the network's data-plane state. This allows them to analyze the network's behavior at a specific point in time (a). Network-wide analysis is indeed possible with data-plane verification, so option (b) is incorrect. Data-plane verification can detect errors that may not be apparent through configuration analysis alone, especially in cases where the control-plane software might have bugs (c). Accurate modeling of network protocols is required for data-plane verification, as it needs to understand how packets are processed and forwarded based on the bits in the packet headers (d). Header-space analysis is not limited to specific packets; it can analyze general properties of flowspace, so option (e) is incorrect.","['https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi12/nsdi12-final138.pdf', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6888898', 'https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/papers/hsa12.pdf']",0,14_verification,0.95,0.9999853532373147
109,Which of the following assertions could be verified with data plane verification? Select all that apply.,"a. The network will remain connected, given the failure of at most two links.
b. Two virtual network ""slices"" are not completely isolated: it is possible for traffic to travel from one slice to the other.
c. The configuration of the network's routing protocols will result in persistent oscillation (i.e., they will never settle on a stable set of routes).
d. The forwarding table state in the routers across the network will result in a forwarding loop.
e. The rules installed on the firewalls in the network ensure that only port 80 traffic can ever reach the web server from the rest of the Internet.
",,"b,d,e","b,d,e",,"Data plane verification is concerned with the current state of the network, including forwarding tables, firewall rules, and potential traffic flows. Therefore, it can be used to verify the following assertions:

b. Two virtual network 'slices' are not completely isolated: Data plane verification can assess the current forwarding rules and paths to determine if there are any points where traffic from one slice could inadvertently be routed to the other slice.

d. The forwarding table state in the routers across the network will result in a forwarding loop: By analyzing the current state of the forwarding tables, data plane verification can detect if there are any loops in the network that would cause packets to circulate endlessly.

e. The rules installed on the firewalls in the network ensure that only port 80 traffic can ever reach the web server from the rest of the Internet: Data plane verification can inspect firewall rules to confirm that they are correctly filtering traffic to allow only port 80 traffic to reach the web server.

On the other hand, assertion a is related to network resilience and would typically be verified using network modeling and fault analysis rather than data plane verification. Assertion c involves the behavior of network routing protocols over time, which is more about control plane stability and would be analyzed using control plane verification techniques.","['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128616301643', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7164901', 'https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi16/technical-sessions/presentation/zeng']",1,14_verification,0.95,0.6966434959610142

",,"a,c,e","a,b,c,e",,"Kinetic is a network control platform that allows for dynamic policy changes in the network. The following statements are true about Kinetic policies: 

a. State transitions in Kinetic policies can be triggered by changes in the network (endogenous) or by external events (exogenous). 

b. Kinetic's NuSMV verifier is a model checking tool that can verify properties of the network, such as ensuring that the data plane will never have loops, which is essential for preventing routing loops that can cause network failures. 

c. Kinetic policies can indeed include state transitions based on timing, such as timeouts, which are critical for handling transient states and failures. 

e. Pyretic is a language for writing network policies that supports modular composition of policies. The composition operators provided by Pyretic can be used to manage and prevent state explosion by structuring policies in a way that reduces complexity.

b. None of the above.
c. SPEC A [ policy=allow U authenticated ]

e. SPEC AG (EF policy=allow)
",,e,e,,"The correct expression for stating 'It is always possible for the policy state to go to 'allow'' in temporal logic is 'SPEC AG (EF policy=allow)'. The 'AG' operator stands for 'Always Globally', meaning that the property must hold in every state along every path starting from the current state. The 'EF' operator stands for 'Exists Finally', meaning that there exists a path where eventually the property will hold. So 'AG (EF policy=allow)' means that in all states (globally), it is possible ('EF') to reach a state where the policy is 'allow'.",['https://nusmv.fbk.eu/NuSMV/userman/v21/nusmv_5.html'],1,14_verification,0.95,0.9999956342685299
