54,Which of the following properties are characteristics of virtual networks (but not necessarily characteristics of SDN). Select all that apply.,"a. Separates the data and control plane.
b. Refactors network control so that network behavior is controlled from a single logically centralized controller.
c. Separates logical and physical networks.
d. Often deployed in data center networks to allow multiple tenants to share physical network infrastructure.
e. Abstracts the details of the physical network.
",,"c,d,e","c,d,e",,"Virtual networks are characterized by the separation of logical and physical networks (c), which allows for the creation of multiple isolated networks that can operate on the same physical infrastructure. This is particularly useful in data center networks (d) where it enables multiple tenants to share the physical network infrastructure without interfering with each other, maintaining their own isolated logical networks. Virtual networks also abstract the details of the physical network (e), presenting a simplified virtual representation to users and administrators that hides the complexity of the underlying physical infrastructure. While SDN also involves the abstraction of the network (and could include characteristics a and b), the question specifically asks for characteristics of virtual networks that are not necessarily characteristics of SDN. SDN's defining properties are the separation of the control and data planes (a) and the centralization of network control (b), but these are not exclusive to virtual networks as they can exist without implementing SDN principles.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_network', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.95,0.9998499490317728
55,Which of the following are possible ways of creating virtual links in a virtual network? Select all that apply.,"a. A wide-area tunnel, whereby an IP packet is encapsulated in an MPLS tunnel by attaching an MPLS header to the packet.
b. Longest-prefix match forwarding on an IP router.
c. A wide-area tunnel, whereby an Ethernet packet sent between two virtual machines is encapsulated in an IP packet.
d. VLAN switching based on a VLAN tag.
e. Pairs of virtual Ethernet interfaces, where one end of the Ethernet interface pair resides in the virtual environment, and the other resides in the root namespace on the host machine.
",,"a,c,d,e","a,c,d,e",,"Virtual links can be created in several ways in a virtual network environment. Option (a) describes an MPLS tunnel, which is a method for encapsulating IP packets with an MPLS header to create a virtual link over a wide area. Option (c) mentions encapsulating an Ethernet packet in an IP packet, which is another way to create a virtual link, commonly known as tunneling (e.g., GRE, VXLAN). Option (d) refers to VLAN switching, which is a technology used to create virtual links within the same physical network by tagging Ethernet frames with a VLAN identifier. Option (e) describes the use of virtual Ethernet interfaces to establish a link between a virtual environment and the host machine, which is a common practice in virtualized environments. Option (b), the longest-prefix match forwarding, is a routing decision process and not a method for creating virtual links.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotocol_Label_Switching', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunneling_protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_network_interface']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.95,0.9997830283238095
56,Which of the following are true of the Mininet network emulator? Select all that apply.,"a. It requires running OpenFlow-capable switches.
b. It is difficult to use it to route traffic for real services.
c. Mininet only allows users to create three types of topologies: linear, tree, and single-switch topologies.
d. It can create an emulation that runs across multiple physically distributed nodes.
e. All of the hosts in the topology must run the same underlying operating system.
",,"b,e","a,b,d",,"Mininet is a network emulator that can create a realistic virtual network, running real kernel, switch and application code, on a single machine. It is designed to support research in Software Defined Networking (SDN) and OpenFlow. Here are the reasons for the selected options:

a. True. Mininet typically requires OpenFlow-capable switches to create a network that can be controlled using SDN controllers.

b. True. While Mininet is versatile, it is primarily used for testing and development purposes, and it can be more complex to use it to route traffic for real services compared to using actual hardware or production-level software solutions.

d. True. Mininet can be extended to run across multiple physical nodes using clustering extensions such as Mininet Cluster Edition, although the basic version of Mininet is designed to run on a single machine.

Option c is incorrect because Mininet is not limited to only three types of topologies. Users can create custom topologies as well.

Option e is incorrect because all of the hosts in a Mininet topology are virtual and run within the same operating system instance as the Mininet process itself.","['http://mininet.org/', 'https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Cluster-Edition', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915003432']",0,7_virtual_networking,0.95,0.35552474264990064
57,"What are the benefits of emulation as opposed to, say, simulation? Select all that apply.","a. An emulation will complete faster than a simulation.
b. An emulator makes it possible to ""port"" experiments from one machine to another.
c. An emulator allows the experimenter run real software on each of the nodes in the emulation.
d. An emulation is easier to debug than a simulation.
e. Every run of the emulator will yield exactly the same results, resulting in reproducible experiments.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"An emulator allows for real software and systems to be tested in a controlled environment, which can include the actual code that would run on the physical devices. This is unlike a simulation, where models are used to represent the behavior of devices and the network. Therefore, an emulator can indeed make it possible to 'port' experiments from one machine to another (b), as the emulation environment can be transferred and set up on different machines. Additionally, an emulator allows the experimenter to run real software on each of the nodes in the emulation (c), which is a significant advantage over simulation, where the behavior is typically modeled and may not reflect the intricacies of the real software. Emulation may not necessarily complete faster than a simulation (a) because it often involves more overhead to run actual software and may interact with hardware. Emulations are not inherently easier to debug than simulations (d); in fact, because they are closer to the complexity of real systems, they can sometimes be more challenging to debug. Finally, emulations do not guarantee that every run will yield exactly the same results (e), as they can be subject to non-deterministic events just like real systems, especially if they involve actual hardware or non-deterministic software behavior.","['https://www.nsnam.org/docs/release/3.9/tutorial/singlehtml/index.html#why-not-use-simulation', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050916302792', 'https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220875670_Network_Emulation_Tools']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.95,0.9998900706526737
58,Which of the following are possible in Mininet? Select all that apply.,"a. Measuring the latency between a host in San Francisco and a host in Los Angeles.
b. Assigning custom IP addresses to each node in the topology.
c. Assigning IP addresses to each node in the topology using a DHCP server.
d. Running performance measurement tools (e.g., iperf, wget) between nodes.
e. ""Shaping"" a link between two nodes to a particular traffic rate.
",,"b,c,d,e","b,d,e",,"Mininet is a network emulator that can create a virtual network on a single machine, and it allows various functionalities for educational and development purposes. Here's why the selected options are possible in Mininet:

- (b) Assigning custom IP addresses to each node in the topology: Mininet allows for the configuration of network settings, including setting custom IP addresses for each node.

- (d) Running performance measurement tools (e.g., iperf, wget) between nodes: Mininet supports the execution of network performance tools like iperf and wget to measure bandwidth, latency, and other network performance metrics between nodes.

- (e) 'Shaping' a link between two nodes to a particular traffic rate: Mininet includes features to emulate network conditions, such as bandwidth limitations, delay, and loss, effectively shaping the traffic on a link.

Option (a) is not possible because Mininet does not simulate real geographic locations or the physical distances between them; it emulates network topologies on a single system. Option (c) is theoretically possible if a DHCP server is emulated within the Mininet topology, but it is not a common use case, as Mininet typically involves manual configuration of network settings for educational purposes.","['http://mininet.org/', 'http://mininet.org/walkthrough/', 'https://github.com/mininet/mininet']",0,7_virtual_networking,0.95,0.8108576387892943
59,Which of the following functions does FlowVisor enable? Select all that apply.,"a. Allowing two different researchers to implement and deploy different load balancing applications for all traffic between the same source-destination pair.
b. Allowing two controllers to control traffic on distinct VLANs.
c. Allowing two different researchers to implement and deploy different Web load balancing applications for port 80 traffic.
d. Allowing two different researchers to implement and deploy control mechanisms for two distinct applications.
e. Allowing one controller to control TCP traffic and one controller to control UDP traffic.
",,"b,d,e","b,d,e",,"FlowVisor is a special purpose OpenFlow controller that acts as a transparent proxy between OpenFlow switches and multiple OpenFlow controllers. It creates slices of network resources and delegates control of each slice to a different controller. This enables multiple controllers to manage different portions of the network traffic based on various parameters such as VLANs, ports, or traffic type (TCP/UDP). Therefore, FlowVisor allows for the following: b) Different controllers to control traffic on distinct VLANs, as it can slice the network by VLAN tags; d) Different researchers to deploy control mechanisms for distinct applications, as FlowVisor can segregate traffic by the application; e) One controller to manage TCP traffic and another to manage UDP traffic, as FlowVisor can differentiate traffic by protocol type. However, a) and c) are not specifically functions of FlowVisor, as they imply the same traffic (same source-destination pair or port 80 traffic) being managed by different controllers for the same application (load balancing), which would typically lead to conflicts without a more specific policy or slicing criterion.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/images/stories/downloads/sdn-resources/onf-specifications/openflow/flowvisor.pdf', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915003188']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.95,0.5408784375874676

61,Select the statement that is most true about the relationship between network virtualization and SDNs.,"a. Network virtualization is a potential enabler for software-defined networks, since the separation of data and control planes first requires the creation of a logical network.
b. Software-defined networking is a potential enabler for virtual networks, since separation of data and control planes makes it easier to manage a logical network topology.
c. Network virtualization is a new concept introduced by Amazon, Nicira, and industry players; it only made sense to talk about network virtualization once central SDN controllers existed.
d. Network virtualization and software-defined networking each enable the other: SDN cannot exist without network virtualization, and network virtualization cannot exist without SDN.
",,b,b,,"Software-defined networking (SDN) is indeed a potential enabler for network virtualization. SDN separates the network's control plane (which makes decisions about where traffic is sent) from the data plane (which actually sends packets to the selected destination). This separation allows for more flexible management of network resources and facilitates the creation of virtual networks by simplifying the control over the network's behavior. Network virtualization can exist without SDN, as it has been used in technologies like VLANs and VPNs prior to the advent of SDN. Likewise, SDN does not strictly require network virtualization to function, although it can leverage virtualization to achieve its goals. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that SDN is a potential enabler for virtual networks.","['https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-the-definition-of-software-defined-networking-sdn/', 'https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/network-virtualization']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.9,0.9948255707204466
