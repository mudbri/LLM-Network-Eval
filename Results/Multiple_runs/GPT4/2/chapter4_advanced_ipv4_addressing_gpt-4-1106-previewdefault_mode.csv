A Class B network has a default subnet mask of /16, so we need to add 7 more bits for the subnetting, which gives us a subnet mask of /23. However, the closest options provided are /21 and /24. Since /24 would only allow for 256 subnets in a Class C network and would not be applicable to a Class B network's subnetting, we can eliminate it. The subnet mask of /21 provides 11 bits for subnetting in a Class B network (since 21 - 16 = 5 and 2^5 = 32 subnets, which is not enough). Therefore, the correct answer is /21 and the corresponding dotted decimal mask 255.255.248.0, which is not listed. However, the closest correct option in dotted decimal format is 255.255.240.0, which corresponds to a /20 subnet mask and provides 2^4 = 16 bits for subnetting within the Class B network, which is more than enough for 90 subnets.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html', 'https://www.ripe.net/about-us/press-centre/understanding-ip-addressing']",0,chapter4_advanced_ipv4_addressing,0.9,0.45654982464821287
