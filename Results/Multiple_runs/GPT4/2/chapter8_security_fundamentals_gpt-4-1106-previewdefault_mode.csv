137,"In a spoofing attack, which of the following parameters are commonly spoofed? (Choose two answers)","a. Source IP address
b. MAC address
c. ARP address
d. Routing table
e. Destination IP address
f. ARP table
",,"a,b","a,b",,"In a spoofing attack, attackers commonly fake or 'spoof' the source IP address to make it appear as though packets are coming from a trusted source, thereby bypassing IP-based security measures. Additionally, the MAC address can also be spoofed to impersonate another device on the local network, which is particularly relevant in ARP spoofing attacks where the attacker sends falsified ARP messages over a local area network. While 'ARP address' is not a correct term (the correct term is ARP table, which is a list of IP addresses to MAC addresses mappings), spoofing an ARP table would be a result of spoofing MAC addresses. Destination IP addresses are not typically spoofed by the attacker, as this would direct the response traffic away from the attacker. Routing tables and ARP tables are not parameters that are spoofed; rather, they can be manipulated or poisoned as a result of spoofing other parameters.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address_spoofing', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_spoofing', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing']",1,chapter8_security_fundamentals,0.95,0.7939219578208847
