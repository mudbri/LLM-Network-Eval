32,What are some of the reasons that it is difficult to deploy improvements to BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. Changes are necessarily incremental because of the large installed base of routers that already run BGP.
b. BGP is implemented in hardware, so deploying changes to BGP requires changes on the timescale of hardware development cycles.
c. Deplyoing changes to BGP requires coordination across potentially tens of thousands of ASes in the Internet.
d. Only a few vendors implement BGP, and deploying changes requires convincing those vendors to change the protocol.
e. Deploying changes requires coordination in standards bodies such as the IETF.
",,"a,c,e","a,c,e",,"Deploying improvements to BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is challenging for several reasons. First, BGP has a large installed base of routers, and any changes must be incremental to avoid disrupting the existing infrastructure, hence option (a) is correct. Second, changes to BGP require coordination across a vast number of Autonomous Systems (ASes), which can be tens of thousands, making it a complex logistical challenge, so option (c) is correct. Lastly, BGP is a standardized protocol, and any changes to it require consensus and coordination within standards bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), making option (e) correct. Option (b) is incorrect because BGP is not implemented in hardware; it is a software-based routing protocol. Option (d) is incorrect because there are more than a few vendors that implement BGP, and the protocol is an open standard, not vendor-specific.","['https://www.ietf.org/', 'https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4271.txt', -1.1]",1,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.95,0.8861012172055966
33,Which of the following are true about the RCP? Select all that apply.,"a. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, the RCP controller for an AS sees all routes for all destinations that an AS learns from neighboring ASes.
b. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, there is no need for ASes to use BGP to exchange routes.
c. In an RCP deployment, routers no longer have to compute routes.
d. The RCP controller operates just like a route reflector would, selecting a single best route for each destination for all client routers.
e. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, a single AS can benefit from deploying RCP even if no other ASes deploy RCP.
",,"c,e","a,c,e",,"The Routing Control Platform (RCP) is a concept in the context of Software Defined Networking (SDN) that separates the control plane from the data plane. This allows for centralized control over routing decisions, which can be made by an RCP controller rather than individual routers.

a. True. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, the RCP controller for an Autonomous System (AS) would indeed see all routes for all destinations that an AS learns from neighboring ASes. This is because the RCP centralizes the control plane functions, including the reception and processing of route advertisements.

c. True. With the RCP, routers are relieved from the task of computing routes. Instead, the RCP controller computes the routing decisions and disseminates them to the routers.

e. True. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, a single AS can benefit from deploying RCP even if no other ASes deploy RCP, as the benefits of centralized control and potentially more optimal routing decisions can be realized within the deploying AS itself.

b. False. Even with RCP, ASes would still use BGP or another routing protocol to exchange routes with each other. RCP changes how routes are processed within an AS, not necessarily the protocol used to exchange routes between ASes.

d. False. While a route reflector also selects routes for clients, the RCP controller has a more comprehensive role in the control plane and can implement a wider array of routing policies and optimizations that go beyond the capabilities of a traditional route reflector.","['https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/egs/beehive/rcp.php', 'https://www.opennetworking.org/software-defined-standards/models-standards/']",0,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.95,0.921745156759646
34,"Which of the following are true about network management with BGP, in the absence of RCP? Select all that apply.","a. BGP's interaction with the underlying routing IGP routing protocol can result in persistent forwarding loops.
b. Implementing network-wide policy sometimes causes the routers themeselves to have to carry state.
c. Each router operates and makes decisions based only on a local view of network state.
d. BGP routing has a single point of failure.
e. It is not possible to perform traffic engineering with conventional BGP.
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"In the absence of a Routing Control Platform (RCP), traditional network management using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) has several characteristics and limitations. Here's the breakdown of the choices provided:

a. True. BGP's interaction with the Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) can indeed result in forwarding loops due to inconsistent views of the network state between the two protocols.

b. True. When implementing network-wide policies, routers may need to carry additional state to enforce these policies, which can lead to scalability issues.

c. True. BGP routers traditionally operate based on their local view of the network state, which is limited to the information received from directly connected neighbors and the best path selection algorithm.

d. False. BGP does not inherently have a single point of failure as it is a distributed protocol where each router independently calculates the best paths. However, if all routers depend on a single router for a particular route, that router can become a single point of failure for that route.

e. False. It is possible to perform traffic engineering with conventional BGP, although it may be complex and less flexible compared to traffic engineering with Software Defined Networking (SDN) or other more advanced techniques.","['https://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2756480', 'https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4271.txt', 'https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/bgp/topics/topic-map/bgp-route-selection-algorithm.html']",1,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.95,0.9917637252878885

b. The second phase of RCP deployment offers potential benefits such as reduced routing table size.
c. In the second phase of deployment, the RCP controller sees all routes for every destination that neighboring ASes advertise.
d. The second phase of deployment requires fewer BGP sessions at the RCP controller than the first phase, thus improving scalability of the controller.
e. In the second phase of RCP deployment, ASes do not need to use BGP to exchange routes with one another.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"The second phase of RCP (Routing Control Platform) deployment typically involves the RCP controller having a more comprehensive view of the network. This means that the controller would see all routes for every destination that neighboring ASes (Autonomous Systems) advertise, which aligns with choice 'c'. Additionally, with a more centralized control over routing decisions, there's potential for optimization such as reducing the routing table size by filtering or aggregating routes, which aligns with choice 'b'. Choice 'a' is not necessarily true as coordination with neighboring ASes might still be required for routing policies and to maintain the integrity of the routing system. Choice 'd' is incorrect because the number of BGP sessions does not necessarily decrease in the second phase; the RCP controller might still need to maintain multiple BGP sessions to gather comprehensive routing information. Choice 'e' is also incorrect because even with RCP deployment, ASes would still typically use BGP to exchange routes, as RCP does not replace the BGP protocol but rather centralizes control of it.","['https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/63/slides/plenaryt-2.pdf', 'https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos561/papers/rcp.pdf', 'https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/nsdi04/tech/full_papers/feamster/feamster.pdf']",1,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.85,0.9203681945821285

e. Simpler routers and switches
",,"c,d,e","a,b,c,d",,"The 4D architecture for network control, which stands for decision, dissemination, discovery, and data, aims to simplify the control plane with several goals in mind. Improved security (a) is a goal because a simpler control plane can be better understood, monitored, and protected. The inherent robustness of the control plane (b) is enhanced when complexity is reduced, as there are fewer points of failure and interactions are more predictable. Simpler management systems (c) are a result of a less complicated control plane, making it easier for network operators to manage the network. Faster innovation (d) is facilitated by a simpler control plane because it allows for quicker implementation and testing of new ideas.
