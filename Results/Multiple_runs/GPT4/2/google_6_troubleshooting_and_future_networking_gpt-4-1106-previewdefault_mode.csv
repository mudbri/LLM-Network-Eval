b. Ping
c. Test-NetConnection
d. Tracert

b. Division
c. Subtraction
d. Addition
",,c,c,,"During a traceroute operation, each router along the path to the destination decrements the Time To Live (TTL) field by one before forwarding the packet. If the TTL reaches zero, the router will not forward the packet and will send an ICMP 'Time Exceeded' message back to the source. This behavior allows traceroute to determine the path packets take to reach their destination by incrementally increasing the TTL value.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceroute', 'https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc792.txt']",1,google_6_troubleshooting_and_future_networking,1,1.0
