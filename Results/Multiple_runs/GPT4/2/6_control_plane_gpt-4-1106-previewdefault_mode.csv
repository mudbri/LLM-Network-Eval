43,Which of the following statements are true about the OpenFlow specification? Select all that apply.,"a. If a switch does not contain a flow table entry that matches a particular packet, the switch forwards the packet to the controller for handling.
b. The main purpose of the OpenFlow control channel is to update flow table entries on switches.
c. The OpenFlow specification provides mechanisms to perform Layer 2 learning across a network of switches.
d. Once a switch has sent one packet for a flow, it must also send all subsequent packets for that flow to the controller.
e. Some versions of the OpenFlow specification allow for performing more than one action on a single packet.
",,"a,b,e","a,b,e",,"The OpenFlow specification is a foundational element for Software Defined Networking (SDN). Here's why the selected statements are true:

- (a) True. In OpenFlow, if a switch does not have a matching flow table entry for a packet, it forwards the packet to the controller. The controller then decides how to handle the packet, which may include adding a new flow entry to the switch.

- (b) True. The OpenFlow control channel is used by the controller to communicate with the switches, primarily for the purpose of installing, updating, or removing flow table entries.

- (e) True. OpenFlow allows for specifying multiple actions to be performed on packets that match a flow table entry. This can include actions like forwarding, modifying the packet, or even sending it to multiple ports.

Statements (c) and (d) are not necessarily true for the OpenFlow specification:

- (c) While OpenFlow can be used to implement Layer 2 learning, the specification itself does not provide mechanisms for learning. Layer 2 learning is typically implemented in the controller software using the OpenFlow protocol.

- (d) This statement is false. Once a switch has a flow table entry for a flow, it does not need to send all subsequent packets to the controller. It can process packets according to the flow table entry without involving the controller for each packet.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/software-defined-standards/specifications/', 'https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/openflow-spec-v1.4.0.pdf']",1,6_control_plane,0.95,0.9986723886520178

",,"b,c,d","b,c,d",,"POX is an open-source development platform for Python-based Software Defined Networking (SDN) control applications, such as OpenFlow SDN controllers. Here's the breakdown of the options provided:

a. POX does not automatically determine the order to install flow table rules. It is up to the programmer to implement the logic for handling inconsistent forwarding behavior.

b. The _handle_PacketIn function in POX is indeed used to determine how a packet should be handled when it arrives at the controller. This is a callback function that is called when a PacketIn event is raised.

c. POX provides functions to modify the flow table entries at a switch. This can be done using the OpenFlow protocol to send flow_mod messages to the switch.

d. POX's performance is typically slower than NOX, which is written in C++ and is known for being more efficient and faster.

e. POX does not automatically determine the priority between two conflicting rules. Priorities for flow rules are typically set by the programmer in the flow_mod messages sent to the switch.

48,What is the difference between a hard timeout and an idle timeout?,"a. A hard timeout occurs exactly at the specified interval, whereas an idle timeout may occur slightly later than the specified interval.
b. A hard timeout expunges a flow table entry regardless of whether there have been active matches, whereas an idle timeout expunges the flow table entry only if there have been no matches for that flow within the specified interval.
c. A hard timeout expunges all flow table entry from the switch, whereas an idle timeout only expunges one flow at a time.
d. A hard timeout expunges a flow table entry for all switches in the network, whereas an idle timeout only expunges the flow table entry on the switches that have seen no matches for that flow within the specified interval.
",,b,b,,"A hard timeout is used to specify the absolute lifetime of a flow in a flow table, after which the flow entry is removed regardless of whether it has seen any packets or not. An idle timeout, on the other hand, is used to remove flow entries that have not seen any packets for a specified amount of time. If a flow entry continues to match packets, it will not be removed even after the idle timeout interval has passed, until no packets match the flow entry for the duration of the idle timeout.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/openflow-spec-v1.3.0.pdf', 'https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7426.txt']",1,6_control_plane,0.95,0.9999741779333953
49,Which of the following are true about hubs and learning switches? Select all that apply,"a. A hub implemented in Pox requires all incoming packets to be directed to the controller.
b. A learning switch requires more logic at the controller (in terms of lines of code in Pox) than a hub.
c. A learning switch implemented in Pox can be easily extended to support firewall capabilities.
d. A learning switch implemented in Pox requires all incoming packets to be redirected to the controller.
e. A hub forwards an incoming packet on all ports (except the incoming port), whereas a switch only floods an incoming packet on all ports if it does not have a table entry that determines the output port for that packet.
",,"b,c,e","b,c,e",,"a. This is not necessarily true. A hub implemented in Pox or any other platform does not require all incoming packets to be directed to the controller. A hub is a simple networking device that forwards incoming packets to all other ports without any processing or decision-making, so it doesn't need a controller's intervention for standard operation. However, in a software-defined networking context, some implementations might involve the controller for initial configuration or for handling exceptional scenarios, but it's not a requirement for regular packet forwarding.

b. True. A learning switch requires more logic at the controller because it needs to maintain a MAC address table and make forwarding decisions based on that table. This involves additional lines of code to handle the learning and decision-making processes.

c. True. A learning switch, because it maintains a MAC address table and has the logic to make forwarding decisions, can be extended to include firewall capabilities such as access control lists (ACLs) to permit or deny traffic based on certain criteria.

d. This is not true for a properly functioning learning switch. A learning switch does not require all incoming packets to be redirected to the controller. It only needs to consult the controller when it encounters a packet with an unknown destination MAC address (i.e., the address is not in its MAC address table). Once it learns the address, it can forward packets to the correct port without involving the controller.

e. True. A hub is a non-intelligent device that forwards incoming packets on all ports except the incoming port. A switch, on the other hand, will flood incoming packets on all ports only if it does not have a table entry that determines the output port for that packet. Once it learns where to send packets for a specific destination (by observing the source addresses of incoming packets), it will only send packets to the appropriate port.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch#Layer_2_switching', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_hub', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking', 'https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-resources/sdn-definition/']",1,6_control_plane,0.95,0.9974555277951596
50,Which of the following functions ensures that the controller will hear PacketIn messages? Select all that apply.,"a. connection.addListeners
b. _handle_PacketIn
c. AddRule
d. init
e. launch
",,a,"a,b",,"In the context of Software Defined Networking (SDN), particularly with controllers such as OpenFlow, 'PacketIn' messages are sent from the switch to the controller when the switch encounters a packet that does not match any of its existing flow table entries. To ensure that the controller hears these 'PacketIn' messages, the controller application must have a listener function that is specifically designed to handle these messages. The 'connection.addListeners' function is used to add listeners to the connection for specific types of events, including 'PacketIn' messages. The '_handle_PacketIn' function is the actual handler that is called when a 'PacketIn' message is received. 'AddRule' is a function that would be used to add a flow rule to a switch, which is not directly related to listening for 'PacketIn' messages. 'init' is typically an initialization function, and 'launch' might be a function used to start the application, but neither are specific to handling 'PacketIn' messages.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/openflow-spec-v1.0.0.pdf', 'https://osrg.github.io/ryu-book/en/html/switching_hub.html']",0,6_control_plane,0.95,0.9843209848569149
51,What are the two key steps of an OpenFlow flow table entry (select two)?,"a. match
b. action
c. redirect
d. drop
e. forward
",,"a,b","a,b",,"In OpenFlow, which is a communications protocol that gives access to the forwarding plane of a network switch or router over the network, a flow table entry consists of two key steps: match and action. The 'match' step involves matching packets to the flow table entries, and the 'action' step specifies what to do with the packets that have been matched, such as forwarding, dropping, modifying, or sending them to the controller. 'Redirect', 'drop', and 'forward' are examples of actions that can be taken on matched packets, but they are not steps in the flow table entry process itself.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/software-defined-standards/specifications/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenFlow']",1,6_control_plane,1,0.9999994935711483

b. It only supports OpenFlow as a ""southbound"" control framework.
c. Its code shares a lot of similarities with Beacon.
d. Open Daylight only supports proprietary switches from Cisco and IBM.
e. It is slower and less scalable than some of the more lightweight SDN controllers such as Pox.
