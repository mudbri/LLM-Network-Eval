91,You have noticed that a server with IP 145.45.3.2 doesn’t respond to requests. What command will you type first in order to test connectivity between your device and the server?,"a. request 145.45.3.2
b. check 145.45.3.2
c. ping 145.45.3.2
d. ping 145.45.3.2
",,c,c,,"The 'ping' command is commonly used to test connectivity between two devices on a network. It sends ICMP echo request packets to the destination and listens for ICMP echo reply packets. If the server is reachable and configured to respond to ping requests, it will reply, and the command will show the response times. Both 'c' and 'd' are the same command, but since 'ping 145.45.3.2' is only listed once as an answer choice, 'c' is the correct answer.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13730-ext-ping-trace.html', 'https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0792.txt']",1,chapter5_ipv4_routing,1,0.9999462853826817
92,"A LAN design uses a Layer 3 EtherChannel between two switches SW1 and SW2, with port-channel interface 1 used on both switches. SW1 uses ports G0/1 and G0/2 in the channel. However, only interface G0/1 is bundled into the channel and working. Think about the configuration settings on port G0/2 that could have existed before adding G0/2 to the EtherChannel. Which answers identify a setting that could prevent IOS from adding G0/2 to the Layer 3 EtherChannel? (Choose two answers.)","a. A different STP cost (spanning-tree cost value)
b. A different access VLAN (switchport access vlan vlanid)
c. A different speed (speed value)
d. A default setting for switchport (switchport)
",,"c,d","c,d",,"When configuring an EtherChannel, it is important that all the interfaces have the same settings to ensure they can form the EtherChannel properly. A difference in speed (c) between interfaces would prevent them from bundling into a single EtherChannel because EtherChannel requires all interfaces to operate at the same speed. The 'switchport' command (d) is used to configure the port as a Layer 2 switch port, but since this is a Layer 3 EtherChannel, using the 'switchport' command would change the port to Layer 2, which would make it incompatible with a Layer 3 EtherChannel. Therefore, the interface must be in no switchport mode to participate in a Layer 3 EtherChannel. On the other hand, a different STP cost (a) would not prevent an interface from joining an EtherChannel, as EtherChannel operates at Layer 2 and the STP settings are negotiated across the entire EtherChannel. A different access VLAN (b) would be relevant for a Layer 2 EtherChannel but not for a Layer 3 EtherChannel, which does not assign VLANs to its ports.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750x_3560x/software/release/15-0_1_se/configuration/guide/3750xscg/swethchl.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-6500-series-switches/10553-20.html']",1,chapter5_ipv4_routing,0.95,0.8270313435287838

The next week, the network engineer receives a call that those same users can no longer ping each other. If the problem is with the Layer 3 switching function, which of the following could have caused the problem? (Choose two answers.)","a. A shutdown command issued from VLAN 4 configuration mode

If VLAN 5 is no longer present on the switch, the SVI for VLAN 5 would also not function, preventing routing between VLAN 4 and VLAN 5.
