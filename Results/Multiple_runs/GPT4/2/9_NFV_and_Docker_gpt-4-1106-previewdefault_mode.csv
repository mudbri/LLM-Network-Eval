72,"In NFV, which of the following is the function of steering?","a. Finding the best location to place a single network function in an enterprise or wide area network.
b. Installing custom packet processing code on servers in the network.
c. Placing middleboxes at places throughout the network to minimize network load.
d. Installing custom packet processing code on switches in the network.
e. Installing flow table entries in switches to forward traffic through network functions or middleboxes that are installed in the network
",,e,e,,"In Network Function Virtualization (NFV), steering refers to the process of directing traffic through a specific set of network functions or middleboxes. This is typically achieved by installing flow table entries in switches that dictate how traffic should be forwarded through the network to ensure it passes through the necessary network functions for processing. Options a, b, c, and d do not describe the steering process within NFV.","['https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/nfv/definitions/whats-network-functions-virtualization-nfv/', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6994333']",1,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.95,0.9907354379759277
74,What are some advantages of Docker containers over virtual machines? Select all that apply.,"a. Containers can be connected to build a virtual network, whereas virtual machines cannot.
b. Performance in containers may be better since they invoke OS system calls directly, rather than through an emulated machine.
c. Containers require less storage and memory per-instance, and require less time to instantiate than virtual machines.
d. Containers provide more flexibility in the choice of operating system.
e. Containers provide better isolation than virtual machines.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"Containers are often preferred over virtual machines for several reasons. Firstly, containers allow applications to make OS system calls directly, which can lead to better performance as there is no hypervisor layer to go through, unlike in virtual machines (b). Secondly, containers are more lightweight in terms of storage and memory usage, and they can be started up much more quickly than virtual machines because they share the host system’s kernel and do not need to boot an OS for each instance (c). As for the other options, containers can indeed be connected to build a virtual network, but this is also true for virtual machines, making option (a) incorrect. Containers typically require the host system’s kernel to be the same as the container's, limiting the flexibility in the choice of the operating system (d). Finally, virtual machines provide better isolation by design because they are completely separated from the host system by the hypervisor, whereas containers share the host OS kernel, making option (e) incorrect.","['https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container', 'https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/', 'https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/containers']",1,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.95,0.99999861435166
75,Which of the following commands is used to instantiate a new Docker container by invoking a command in that container?,"a. docker stop
b. docker attach
c. docker commit
d. docker pull
e. docker run
",,e,e,,The 'docker run' command is used to create a new container from a specified image and start it immediately. It can also invoke a command within that container upon instantiation.,"['https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/', 'https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container']",1,9_NFV_and_Docker,1,0.9999998063873687
76,Which of the following is true about networking Docker containers? Select all that apply.,"a. Docker containers can be networked to each other via the native Docker bridge or Open vSwitch.
b. A Docker container can never expose a low port (e.g., port 80) to the external Internet; Internet hosts must always reach a Docker service by a high port (e.g., 8080).
c. Docker containers running in different virtual machines cannot be networked together.
d. Connecting Docker containers requires setting up GRE tunnels between the containers.
e. Docker containers are not reachable from the external Internet by default.
",,"a,e","a,e",,"Docker containers can indeed be networked to each other using the native Docker bridge network or by using third-party solutions such as Open vSwitch. This allows for communication between containers on the same host or across different hosts. Option (e) is also correct; by default, Docker containers are not exposed to the external Internet. You must explicitly map container ports to host ports to make them accessible from the outside, which is done using port forwarding features of Docker. Option (b) is incorrect because Docker does allow you to expose low ports like port 80 to the external Internet by mapping them to the host's port. Option (c) is incorrect because Docker containers running on different virtual machines can be networked together, for example, using overlay networks. Option (d) is incorrect because connecting Docker containers does not require setting up GRE tunnels; Docker provides simpler mechanisms for networking containers, such as user-defined bridges, overlays, and host networking.","['https://docs.docker.com/network/', 'https://docs.docker.com/network/overlay/', 'https://docs.docker.com/network/bridge/', 'https://www.openvswitch.org/']",1,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.95,0.9994832459507387
