1,Which of the following are true about Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)? Select all that apply.,"a. The only sizes for an IP address allocation before CIDR were 8, 16, or 24 bits.
b. The prefix length for a CIDR prefix can be anywhere in the range from 0 to 32 bits.
c. In an Internet forwarding table with CIDR, there can only be one unique matching entry for any given IP address.
d. CIDR slowed the rate of Internet routing table growth because prefixes no longer had to be allocated in fixed-size blocks.
",,"b,d","b,c,d",,"CIDR, or Classless Inter-Domain Routing, was introduced to improve the allocation of IP addresses and the scalability of route aggregation. Before CIDR, IP address allocation was based on classful network design which indeed had standard sizes of 8, 16, or 24 bits (Class A, B, and C networks respectively). However, CIDR allows for more flexible prefix lengths that can range anywhere from 0 to 32 bits (option b). This flexibility allows for more efficient use of the IP address space. In an Internet forwarding table with CIDR, each IP address can match only one unique entry, ensuring that each packet is routed to a single destination (option c). CIDR also slowed the growth of Internet routing tables because it allowed for the aggregation of prefixes into larger, variable-sized blocks, reducing the number of individual routes that needed to be advertised (option d).","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing', 'https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1519']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9980151235577607
2,Which of the following are true about how DNS lookups work? Select all that apply.,"a. A DNS A-record query for google.com will only return a single IP address at a time.
b. An NS-record query for a DNS lookup will return the name(s) of the authoritative name server(s) for that domain.
c. If your local DNS resolver caches an NS record for google.com for multiple days, all clients who use that DNS resolver will continue using the same IP address to reach Google’s Web server until that NS record expires.
d. An MX-record query for a DNS lookup will return the IP address of the mail server for that domain.
e. All DNS PTR records are maintained by a single organization in-addr.arpa.
",,b,"b,d",,"Option (b) is correct because an NS-record (Name Server record) indeed points to the authoritative name server(s) for the domain, which is essential for delegating the responsibility of a sub-domain or a domain to another DNS server. Option (d) is also correct as an MX-record (Mail Exchange record) specifies the mail server responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a domain and may also specify the priority of mail servers if there are multiple ones.

Option (a) is incorrect because a DNS A-record (Address record) query for a domain like google.com can return multiple IP addresses, not just a single one. This allows for load balancing and redundancy. Option (c) is incorrect because caching an NS record does not determine the IP address that clients use to reach a web server; it only determines which name server they ask for domain-specific queries. The A-record or AAAA-record for google.com would be responsible for the IP address clients use. Option (e) is incorrect because PTR records (Pointer records), used for reverse DNS lookups, are not maintained by a single organization; they are distributed across the organizations responsible for the IP addresses.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-ns-record/', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-mx-record/', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-a-record/', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-ptr-record/']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9794127948534451
3,Which of the following are true about traffic control with BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
b. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
c. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
d. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
",,"a,b","a,b",,"a. The BGP local preference attribute is used to influence the outbound traffic from an Autonomous System (AS). It determines the preferred path for outbound traffic when there are multiple exit points from an AS. A higher local preference value is preferred over a lower one.

b. AS path prepending involves artificially inflating the length of the AS path attribute by repeating an AS's own number. This makes a path look less preferable, and it is commonly used to influence inbound traffic into an AS. By making a route look longer, other ASes are less likely to select it, thus influencing the path that inbound traffic takes.

c. BGP AS path prepending does not control outbound traffic; it is used for influencing inbound traffic as described in option b.

d. The BGP local preference attribute does not influence inbound traffic; it is used for outbound traffic preference as described in option a.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/13759-21.html', 'https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/concept/policy-bgp-as-path-prepending.html']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9962806379886597
4,Which of the following are true about layering? Select all that apply.,"a. The network layer guarantees reliable, in-order delivery of packets.
b. The network layer has only a single protocol in widespread use today, representing what we call the “narrow waist”.
c. The transport layer uses port numbers.
d. The destination address in the link layer header is always the address of the next layer-3 node along an end-to-end IP path.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"Layering refers to the design of network architectures in layers, each with specific functions and protocols. Here's why the selected options are correct:

b. The 'narrow waist' of the Internet protocol suite refers to the fact that the network layer (specifically, the Internet layer) has a single protocol that is almost universally used: the Internet Protocol (IP). This is what makes the Internet interoperable.

 c. The transport layer, which includes protocols like TCP and UDP, uses port numbers to distinguish between different services or applications on a host.

The other options are incorrect because:

a. The network layer does not guarantee reliable, in-order delivery of packets; that is a function typically provided by the transport layer (e.g., TCP). IP, which operates at the network layer, is an unreliable protocol.

 d. The destination address in the link layer header is the address of the next node on the local network segment, not necessarily the next layer-3 node along the end-to-end IP path, unless the next hop is the final destination.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_layer']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9998172588791931
5,Which of the following are not true about packet switching? Select all that apply.,"a. Once a connection is established between two endpoints in a packet switched network, the end-to-end route cannot change, or the connection must be re-established.
b. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will always experience predictable latency.
c. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will never be dropped by intermediate nodes along the path.
d. A user of a packet switched network might occasionally get a “busy signal” if there are too many users on the network.
",,"a,b,c,d","a,b,c",,"Option (a) is not true because in packet-switched networks, the route can change dynamically even after a connection is established, and packets can take different paths to reach the destination; there is no need to re-establish the connection if the route changes. Option (b) is not true because packet-switched networks can have variable latency due to various factors like network congestion, the varying length of the routes packets take, and the processing time at each node. Option (c) is not true because packets can indeed be dropped in packet-switched networks if nodes become overloaded or if errors occur during transmission. Option (d) is not applicable to packet-switched networks because the concept of a 'busy signal' is more associated with circuit-switched networks where a dedicated path is required for the connection; packet-switched networks handle congestion differently, often through queuing and packet dropping.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching', 'https://www.techopedia.com/definition/25857/packet-switched-network', 'https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/packet-switching']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9710819226094316
6,Which of the following are true about content distribution networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Content distribution networks can improve the performance that a client sees by reducing the network latency between the client and the content that it is downloading.
b. Content distribution networks can reduce transit expenses for a content provider by enabling much of the provider’s content to be served from a nearby network, sometimes even from a cache that is within the client’s own network.
c. Real-time content such as video streams cannot be distributed from a content distribution network.
d. Content distribution networks typically redirect Web clients to a nearby Web cache by rewriting the IP address of packets sent from the client to the IP address of the nearby Web cache.
",,"a,b","a,b,d",,"Content distribution networks (CDNs) are designed to improve the delivery of content to clients across the internet. Option (a) is correct because CDNs distribute content across various locations closer to users, which reduces the distance data must travel, thereby reducing latency and improving performance. Option (b) is also correct because CDNs can serve content from locations closer to the end-user, often utilizing caching, which can reduce the bandwidth costs (transit expenses) for the content provider. Option (c) is incorrect because CDNs are indeed used for distributing real-time content such as video streams; they use various techniques to handle the unique challenges of streaming. Option (d) is correct as CDNs often use DNS redirection or URL rewriting to redirect clients to the nearest server or cache.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/', 'https://aws.amazon.com/cdn/', 'https://www.akamai.com/our-thinking/cdn/what-is-a-content-delivery-network-cdn']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.99999722870524
7,Which of the following are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control? Select all that apply.,"a. Only wireless networks can have collisions at the receiver; such collisions are not possible on wired Ethernet networks.
b. Using RTS/CTS (“request to send”, “clear to send”) control reduces the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network.
c. A wireless sender can avoid causing a collision at the receiver by performing a “carrier sense” to determine whether any other sender wants to transmit at the time that it wishes to send a packet.
d. Disabling RTS/CTS necessarily lowers the effective throughput of the wireless network, since more collisions will occur at the receiver without RTS/CTS enabled.
",,b,"b,c",,"Option (b) is true because the use of RTS/CTS frames in a wireless network adds overhead, which consumes bandwidth that could otherwise be used for data transmission, thus reducing the overall achievable throughput. Option (c) is also true because carrier sense is a part of the CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) protocol used in 802.11 wireless networks to reduce the likelihood of collisions by checking if the medium is free before attempting to transmit. Option (a) is incorrect because collisions can occur on both wired and wireless Ethernet networks; however, the collision domains and behaviors differ due to the nature of the medium. Wired networks use CSMA/CD (Collision Detection) to handle collisions, while wireless networks use CSMA/CA. Option (d) is not necessarily true because while RTS/CTS can help prevent collisions in certain scenarios (like the hidden node problem), disabling RTS/CTS does not always lower effective throughput; in environments with low contention, the overhead of RTS/CTS might actually reduce throughput, and disabling it could improve performance.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-sense_multiple_access_with_collision_avoidance', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11#MAC_layer', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-sense_multiple_access_with_collision_detection']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9998217877916825
8,Which of the following are true about video streaming? Select all that apply.,"a. Using UDP to stream a video instead of TCP is appropriate if the client is more concerned about low delay and interactivity than it does about receiving a high-quality stream.
b. A larger playout buffer at the client allows the client more time to recover from lost packets.
c. Using TCP for video streaming could result in larger delays between transmission and playout than streaming the same video with UDP.
d. Since UDP provides no reliable delivery guarantees, a video streaming application that uses UDP as its transport cannot recover from any packet loss in the video stream.
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"a. UDP is a protocol designed for applications that require fast, efficient transmission, such as video streaming. It does not guarantee packet delivery, which can be beneficial for streaming where receiving packets out of order or losing some packets is preferable to the delay caused by TCP's error correction mechanisms. UDP is chosen for low-latency streaming at the expense of potential errors in the data.
b. A larger playout buffer at the client side allows for temporary storage of incoming data which gives the client more time to deal with network jitter and to recover from lost or delayed packets by rebuffering. This can improve the quality of the stream by reducing the chance of playback interruption.
c. TCP includes congestion control and error recovery features that can introduce additional latency in the transmission of data. For video streaming, this could result in larger delays between transmission and playout compared to UDP, which lacks these features and therefore can transmit data with less delay.
d. This statement is incorrect because even though UDP does not provide reliable delivery guarantees, video streaming applications can implement their own mechanisms for error correction and recovery from packet loss. This could involve techniques such as forward error correction (FEC) or retransmission of lost packets based on application-level protocols.","['https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc768', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_Transport_Protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9999808235742201
9,Which of the following are true about TCP? Select all that apply.,"a. TCP guarantees that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted.
b. A TCP sender and receiver use a “three-way handshake” both to set up and to terminate the TCP connection.
c. TCP’s congestion avoidance algorithm causes the sender to reduce its sending rate by a factor of two when it sees a packet loss.
d. A TCP sender controls its sending rate by adjusting the number of unacknowledged packets that can be sent over the network at any time.
",,"a,c,d","a,b,c,d",,"All of the statements provided are true characteristics of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). a) TCP does guarantee that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted, which is a feature known as reliable delivery. b) TCP uses a three-way handshake to establish a connection before any data is sent and also to terminate the connection once communication is complete. c) TCP's congestion avoidance algorithm, specifically TCP Tahoe and TCP Reno, indeed reduces the sender's transmission window by a factor of two upon detecting packet loss, which is a part of the 'multiplicative decrease' behavior. d) TCP controls its sending rate by manipulating the size of the congestion window, which determines the number of unacknowledged packets that can be in transit.","['https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control']",0,1_SDN_Basics,1,0.9372949984690496
10,Which of the following are true about denial of service attacks (and defenses)? Select all that apply.,"a. If every network on the Internet performed stateless ingress filtering to defend against source IP spoofing, the DNS reflection attack would not work.
b. If every network on the Internet performed stateless egress filtering to defend against source IP address spoofing, the DNS reflection attack could not be carried out.
c. In a “SYN Flood” attack, each TCP SYN packet that a victim receives causes it to set up TCP connection state.
d. A “DNS Reflection” attack requires the attacking client to “spoof” the source IP address of the packet containing the DNS request.
",,"b,c,d","a,c,d",,"a. Correct. Stateless ingress filtering is a technique used to ensure that incoming packets have a source IP address that matches the network they are coming from. If every network implemented this, attackers would not be able to use IP address spoofing to direct the response of a DNS server to a victim, which is essential for a DNS reflection attack.
c. Correct. In a SYN Flood attack, the attacker sends a large number of TCP SYN packets to the victim's server, each of which prompts the server to allocate resources and respond with a SYN-ACK packet, waiting for the final ACK to complete the TCP handshake. However, the ACK is never sent by the attacker, leading to resource exhaustion on the server.
d. Correct. A DNS Reflection attack involves the attacker sending DNS queries with a spoofed source IP address (the victim's IP), causing the DNS server to send the response to the victim instead of the attacker, overwhelming the victim with traffic.
b. Incorrect. Egress filtering controls traffic as it exits a network. While it is useful in preventing a network from being the source of an attack, it does not prevent an attacker from exploiting a DNS server to reflect an attack to a victim. The statement is incorrect as stated because it is ingress filtering, not egress filtering, that would prevent the spoofed packets from leaving the network where the attack originates.","['https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp38', 'https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-015', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/dns-amplification-ddos-attack/']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9759305772005854
