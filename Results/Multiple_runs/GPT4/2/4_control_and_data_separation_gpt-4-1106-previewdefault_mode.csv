25,What could be the operational steps behind the AT&T's IRSCP (a commercial version of the Routing Control Platform) for detecting malicious traffic? Select all that apply.,"a. The controller sees all traffic passing through the network, detects an attack, and installs a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where the attack traffic is originating.
b. The end host changes its IP address so that it is no longer the target of the attack traffic.
c. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to re-route traffic through a deep-packet inspection device.
d. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to install a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where attack traffic is originating.
e. A victim end host sends an alert to an on-path firewall about the source and nature of an attack, at which point the firewall installs a null route to drop the traffic at the entry point where the attack is originating.
",,"c,d","a,c,d",,"AT&T's IRSCP (Integrated Routing and Service Control Point) is designed to enhance network control and security. The steps involved in detecting and mitigating malicious traffic typically include: a) The controller (in this case, IRSCP) having visibility over the network traffic, detecting an attack, and installing a null route to prevent the attack traffic from entering the network. c) A measurement system detecting an attack, identifying where it is entering the network, and instructing a controller to reroute the malicious traffic to a security device (like a deep-packet inspection device) for further analysis or mitigation. d) Similarly, a measurement system can detect an attack and instruct a controller to install a null route to drop the traffic right at the point of entry, preventing it from traversing the network. Option b is not typically a network control function but rather a potential end-host response, which is not directly related to IRSCP operations.

c. Improved logging capabilities.
d. Planned maintenance of an edge router.
e. Forecasting of network capacity.
",,"a,b,d","a,b,d,e",,"Software Defined Networking (SDN) simplifies network management by separating the control plane (which makes decisions about where traffic should go) from the data plane (which actually forwards traffic to the selected destination). This separation allows for more flexible and centralized management of networking tasks. Here's how the given options relate to SDN benefits: a. Improved interdomain routing security - SDN can enhance security by allowing centralized and programmable control over routing decisions, which can improve the security of interdomain routing. b. Customer-controlled egress selection - SDN enables customers to have more control over their network traffic, including the selection of egress points. d. Planned maintenance of an edge router - SDN allows for better network programmability, which makes it easier to reroute traffic and perform maintenance on network devices such as edge routers without disrupting service. e. Forecasting of network capacity - With centralized control, SDN can provide better visibility into network performance and utilization, aiding in capacity planning and forecasting.

27,What are some of the motivations for using Layer-2 forwarding in a data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Ability to use existing routing protocols to establish paths between hosts.
b. Easier configuration/administration, since there is no need to number hosts or configure subnets.
c. Better security properties.
d. Better scaling properties.
e. Better load balancing properties.
",,b,"b,d,e",,"Layer-2 forwarding in a data center is often motivated by several factors: (b) Easier configuration and administration because there is no need to number hosts or configure subnets. This is because Layer-2 networks use MAC addresses for forwarding decisions, which are typically assigned to devices by the manufacturer and do not require manual configuration like IP addresses. (d) Better scaling properties are also a motivation because flat Layer-2 networks can be easier to scale out without the need for complex routing schemes that are required in Layer-3 networks. (e) Better load balancing properties are possible due to the ability to use techniques such as Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) to distribute traffic across multiple paths at Layer-2. However, (a) is not correct because Layer-2 forwarding uses MAC addresses and does not utilize IP routing protocols to establish paths. (c) is not necessarily true as Layer-2 networks can be less secure due to the potential for broadcast storms and the lack of inherent segmentation offered by Layer-3 networks.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise/design-zone-data-centers/design-guide-content/layer2-layer3-design.html', 'https://www.networkworld.com/article/2224726/why-layer-2-networks-could-be-the-best-thing-for-data-centers.html', 'https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7432.txt']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.95,0.650727251993935
28,How does the separation of the control and data plane make networking in data centers easier?,"a. Virtual machines can be migrated within the network without renumbering entire portions of the network or re-assigning network services to different IP addresses.
b. The control plane allows traffic to be forwarded using Layer 2 addresses, thus allowing automatic load balance across the topology.
c. The separation allows fewer switches to be used in the data center topology, thus lowering costs.
d. All routes can be controlled and monitored from a central point of control.
e. A network controller can permit the renumbering of end hosts to have topology-dependent Layer 2 MAC addresses.
",,"a,d,e","a,d",,"The separation of the control and data planes in Software Defined Networking (SDN) allows for centralized management and greater flexibility in network operations. Virtual machines can indeed be migrated without the need to renumber or re-assign network services, as the control plane can dynamically update the network configuration to reflect changes in VM locations (option a). Moreover, having a centralized control plane allows all routes to be controlled and monitored from a single point, simplifying network management and enabling more efficient use of resources (option d). Option b is incorrect because while SDN can aid in load balancing, the control plane does not inherently allow traffic to be forwarded using Layer 2 addresses for this purpose. Option c is misleading because the separation of planes does not directly affect the number of physical switches needed. Option e is incorrect because the renumbering of end hosts to have topology-dependent MAC addresses is not a typical feature or advantage of SDN.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/software-defined-networking/index.html', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-the-definition-of-software-defined-networking-sdn/']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.95,0.9999992551639774

Forwarding loops (e) can be created if inconsistent or out-of-sync routing information is propagated by different controllers.

c. Only keeping a subset of the network state in memory at any time.
d. Using different controllers for independent parts of the network.
e. Having multiple controllers install forwarding table entries on the same router and resolving the conflict on the router itself.
",,"a,b,c,d","a,b,d",,"In the context of Software Defined Networking (SDN), consistency across controller replicas is crucial for maintaining a coherent network state and ensuring reliable network operations. Here are the reasons for selecting the given options:

a. Running a consistency protocol across controller replicas is a standard approach to ensure that all replicas have the same view of the network state. This can involve distributed consensus algorithms like Raft or Paxos.

b. Keeping a 'hot spare' replica means that there is a fully synchronized backup controller ready to take over immediately if the primary controller fails. This helps in maintaining consistency because the 'hot spare' has an up-to-date copy of the network state.

d. Using different controllers for independent parts of the network can help in managing consistency by reducing the scope of state that each controller needs to manage. This approach can limit the impact of inconsistencies to smaller, manageable areas of the network.

c. Only keeping a subset of the network state in memory at any time is not necessarily a method for coping with inconsistency; it could actually lead to more inconsistency if not managed properly.

e. Having multiple controllers install forwarding table entries on the same router and resolving the conflict on the router itself is not a typical approach for managing consistency. This could lead to unpredictable behavior and is generally not recommended as routers are not designed to resolve such conflicts.

b. Only performing control-plane operations for a limited set of network operations.
c. Eliminating redundant data structures.
d. Sending all traffic through the controller to minimize forwarding decisions that the routers and switches must make.
e. Running multiple controllers, and having each controller only manage a part of the network.
",,"a,b,c,e","a,c,e",,"In Software Defined Networking (SDN), the control plane is separated from the data plane to provide more flexibility and programmability in network management. However, this separation can introduce scalability challenges. To cope with these challenges, several approaches can be adopted: 

a. Caching forwarding decisions in the data plane can significantly reduce the number of queries to the controller, as decisions for recurring flows do not need to be recomputed or re-sent by the controller. 
c. Eliminating redundant data structures helps in optimizing the use of resources, both in the control plane and the data plane, which can aid in scaling. 
e. Running multiple controllers in a distributed manner where each controller is responsible for a subset of the network can help in scaling the control plane by distributing the load and avoiding a single point of failure or bottleneck. 

Option b is not typically a scalability strategy; limiting control-plane operations would restrict the functionality and flexibility of SDN, which are its primary benefits. Option d is incorrect because sending all traffic through the controller would create a significant bottleneck and is contrary to the principles of SDN, where the data plane should handle forwarding efficiently based on the control plane's decisions.","['https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/software-defined-networking', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6602305', 'https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261359491_Scalability_in_Software_Defined_Networking']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.95,0.8631909304209678
32,"Which property guarantees that each RCP replica continues to install correct forwarding state in the network data plane, even in the case of a partition in the data plane?","a. Each controller has a complete view of the portion of the network that it is controlling, and therefore can guarantee consistent routing within that partition.
b. The controller cannot see many of the routers in the network anyway, so there is no way for it to install incorrect routing state in the routers that it is not connected to.
c. The controllers are partitioned from the network routers, and the routers will fall back to running a distributed routing protocol.
d. Running the network from a single high-level control plane guarantees that network partitions and loops never occur in the first place.
",,a,a,,"The property described in the question is related to the ability of a Software Defined Networking (SDN) controller to maintain a consistent view of the network, or at least the portion it controls, despite network partitions. Option 'a' is correct because if each controller maintains a complete and accurate view of its domain, it can ensure that the forwarding state it installs is correct for that partition. This does not prevent partitions but ensures that routing remains consistent within each partition. The other options either misunderstand the nature of SDN's centralized control (b and d) or suggest a fallback to distributed protocols, which is not a property of the RCP (Routing Control Platform) itself (c).","['https://www.opennetworking.org/software-defined-standards/overview/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking']",1,4_control_and_data_separation,0.95,0.9945650222253688
