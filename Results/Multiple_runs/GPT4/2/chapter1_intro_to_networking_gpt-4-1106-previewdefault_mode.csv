1,Which of the following terms describe Ethernet addresses that can send one frame and is delivered to multiple devices on the LAN? (Choose two answers.),"a. Broadcast address
b. Multicast address
c. IP address
d. MAC address
e. Unicast address
",,"a,b","a,b",,"In Ethernet networking, a broadcast address is used to send a frame to all devices on the local area network (LAN). This is typically represented by an address of all 1s in binary, or FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF in hexadecimal notation for MAC addresses. A multicast address is used to send a frame to a group of devices on a LAN that have been configured to listen for transmissions sent to that specific address. Unlike unicast addresses, which are unique to a single network interface, broadcast and multicast addresses are designed for one-to-many communication.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_address', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_address', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/ip-multicast/13749-1.html']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,1,0.999998420739297

b. CSMA/CA
c. TCP/IP
d. TCP/UDP
",,a,a,,"CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection) is the set of rules used in networks, particularly Ethernet networks, to determine how devices on a network respond when they try to send data at the same time and a collision occurs. When a collision is detected, CSMA/CD dictates that each device must wait a random amount of time before attempting to retransmit. This helps to prevent the devices from colliding again when they retransmit.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-sense_multiple_access_with_collision_detection', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/smb/switches/cisco-200-series-smart-switches/smb4884-how-does-csma-cd-work-on-a-switch.html']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,1,0.9999995679800934
