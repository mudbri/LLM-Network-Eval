c. Full duplex is a form of simplex communications.
d. Full duplex is slower than half duplex.
",,b,b,,"Full duplex and half duplex refer to the ability of a communication channel to send and receive data. Full duplex allows for communication in both directions simultaneously, which means that both ends of the communication channel can send and receive data at the same time. On the other hand, half duplex means that the communication channel can either send or receive data at one time, but not both simultaneously. Therefore, in a half duplex system, the two ends take turns in using the communication channel. This is not related to whether hubs or switches are in use (choice a), nor is full duplex a form of simplex communications (choice c), which is one-way communication. Full duplex is not inherently slower than half duplex (choice d); in fact, it can be more efficient in scenarios where two-way communication is necessary.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_(telecommunications)', 'https://www.diffen.com/difference/Full_Duplex_vs_Half_Duplex']",1,google_1_basics_computer_networking,0.99,0.9999863364673469
