204,"The customer edge device is typically a router, that sits at a customer site on MPLS networks and connects to a provider edge router (PE router) to take communications from a customer site to a provider side.","a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",,a,a,,"The statement is true. In MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching) networks, the Customer Edge (CE) device is typically a router located at the customer's premises. It connects to the Provider Edge (PE) router, which is part of the service provider's network. The CE router is responsible for communicating the customer's traffic to the PE router, which then forwards it across the provider's MPLS network.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/net_mgmt/ip_solution_center/5-2/mpls_vpn/user/guide/mpls52book/concepts.html', 'https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/mpls-applications/topics/topic-map/mpls-customer-edge-router.html']",1,chapter12_network_design_architecture,1,0.9999905085465441

b. Star
c. Hybrid
d. Partial Mesh
",,a,a,,"A full mesh network design is one where each node in the network has a direct link to every other node. This design ensures maximum redundancy and reliability, as there is always an alternative path for data if one link goes down. However, it is costly and complex to implement due to the number of links required, which grows exponentially with the number of nodes.","['https://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2202410', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking']",1,chapter12_network_design_architecture,1,0.9999998063873687

211,Your company plans to start using public cloud service and now you are considering different WAN options. Your main concern is security by keeping the data private while also providing good QoS services. Which of the following options are under consideration? (Choose two answers.),"a. Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider
b. Using an Internet connection without VPN
c. Using an Internet connection with VPN
d. Using an intercloud exchange
",,"a,d","a,c",,"When considering WAN options for connecting to a public cloud service with a focus on security and QoS, the following options are viable: a) Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider ensures that the data remains private as it does not traverse the public internet. This also allows for better QoS since the connection is dedicated and can be managed end-to-end. c) Using an Internet connection with VPN also provides security by encrypting the data that is sent over the public internet, ensuring privacy. The QoS might not be as good as with a private WAN connection due to the variability of the Internet, but it is more secure than an unencrypted connection.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/what-is-sd-wan.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/what-is-a-vpn.html']",0,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,0.9999967518919751

b. FALSE
",,b,b,,"In a Public Cloud solution, the cloud service provider is responsible for the management, maintenance, and updating of data centers. Customers using public cloud services do not have to deal with the physical infrastructure; instead, they can focus on deploying and managing their applications and services.

213,"A company uses a Metro Ethernet WAN with an Ethernet LAN (E-LAN) service, with the company headquarters plus 20 remote sites connected to the service. The enterprise uses OSPF at all sites, with one router connected to the service from each site. Which of the following are true about the Layer 3 details most likely used with this service and design? (Choose all that apply)","a. The WAN uses one IP subnet
b. The WAN uses 20 or more IP subnets
c. A remote site router would have one OSPF neighbor
d. A remote site router would have 20 OSPF neighbors
",,"a,d","a,c",,"An Ethernet LAN (E-LAN) service in a Metro Ethernet environment operates similarly to a traditional LAN. It is designed to connect multiple sites in a point-to-multipoint or multipoint-to-multipoint configuration, where all sites appear to be on the same Ethernet network. This allows for all sites to be on the same IP subnet, which makes option 'a' correct. Since all sites appear to be on the same Ethernet network, each router would see all other routers as directly connected OSPF neighbors. However, in OSPF, each router would only form a full adjacency with a designated router (DR) and a backup designated router (BDR) on the network, not with every other router. This means that a remote site router would typically have one OSPF neighbor relationship in the full state, which is with the DR (or BDR if the DR fails), making option 'c' correct. Options 'b' and 'd' are incorrect because they assume a different topology model that does not apply to an E-LAN service.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Enterprise/WAN_and_MAN/EME.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/open-shortest-path-first-ospf/7039-1.html#t20']",0,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,0.998813932065238

c. Infrastructure as a Service
d. Database as a Service
",,c,c,,"Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the correct answer. IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, which includes compute, network, and storage resources.
