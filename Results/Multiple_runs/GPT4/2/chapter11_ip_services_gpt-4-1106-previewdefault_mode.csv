You are responsible to find out why users are not being able to reach the Internet.","a. The cause is not related to dynamic NAT
b. The command output does not provide any clue to identify the problem
c. Dynamic NAT can't use Standard ACLs
d. The NAT pool does not have enough entries to fulfill the user's requests
",,d,d,,"The output indicates that the NAT pool 'examsdigest' has a total of 10 addresses available for dynamic NAT translation (from 190.1.1.1 to 190.1.1.10), and all 10 addresses are already allocated (100%). Additionally, there have been 595 misses, which means there were 595 instances where an inside device tried to access an outside network but could not be allocated an address from the NAT pool because the pool was exhausted. This suggests that the NAT pool does not have enough addresses to accommodate all the requests from the users trying to access the Internet.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/network-address-translation-nat/13772-12.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipaddr_nat/configuration/xe-16/nat-xe-16-book/iadnat-addr-consv.html']",1,chapter11_ip_services,0.95,0.9999837140256179

d. CDP
",,a,a,,"NTP (Network Time Protocol) is used to synchronize the clocks of computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is used for sending emails.

Loss - QoS can minimize packet loss by managing congestion and prioritizing traffic. d. Delay - QoS can reduce latency for time-sensitive applications by prioritizing their traffic. f. Jitter - QoS can smooth out variations in packet arrival times, which is crucial for applications like VoIP.
