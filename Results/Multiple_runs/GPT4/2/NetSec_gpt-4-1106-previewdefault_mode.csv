b. dynamic PAT
c. static PAT
d. policy NAT
e. dynamic NAT
",,d,d,,"Policy NAT (also known as Policy-based NAT) allows the implementation of translations based on policies, which can include the destination address.

2,Which form of NAT uses port addresses to distinguish between translated sessions? Select one choice.,"a. static NAT
b. policy NAT
c. dynamic PAT
d. dynamic NAT
",,c,c,,"Port Address Translation (PAT), also known as NAT overload, uses port numbers to distinguish between different translated sessions. This allows multiple devices on a local network to be mapped to a single public IP address but with a unique port number for each session. Static NAT creates a one-to-one mapping and does not use port numbers to distinguish sessions. Dynamic NAT also maps unregistered IP addresses to registered IP addresses from a pool but does not use port numbers to distinguish between sessions. Policy NAT is used to implement NAT based on certain criteria, like time of day or traffic type, and does not inherently use port numbers to distinguish sessions.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/network-address-translation-nat/4606-8.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation#Port_address_translation']",1,NetSec,0.95,0.9999995679800934

Attackers can use DNS servers to amplify the volume of data sent to a target server, overwhelming it with traffic. This is done by making small query requests that result in much larger responses being sent to the spoofed IP address of the target. This type of attack is known as a DNS amplification attack.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/dns-amplification-ddos-attack/', 'https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-088A']",1,NetSec,0.95,0.999944378229948
33,Which type of attack forces a machine to respond to a SYN message by sending a packet to itself on the same port it received the SYN? Select one choice.,"a. Smurf
b. Land attack
c. Amplification attack
d. Reflection attack
",,b,b,,"A Land attack is a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack that sends a special crafted packet to a machine with the SYN flag set, where the source and destination IP addresses are the same as the target machine, and the destination port is the same as the source port. This causes the machine to reply to itself continuously, consuming its resources and potentially leading to a crash or severe performance degradation.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAND', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/land-attack']",1,NetSec,0.95,1.0
34,A Layer 2 redirect or spoofing attack can be referred to as what type of attack? Select one choice.,"a. ARP attack
b. DHCP attack
c. NetBios attack
d. SSID attack
",,a,a,,"A Layer 2 redirect or spoofing attack that targets the resolution of IP addresses to MAC addresses is known as an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) attack. ARP spoofing involves sending fake ARP messages over a local area network (LAN), which results in the linking of an attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network. This allows the attacker to intercept, modify, or stop data-in-transit.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/arp-spoofing.html']",1,NetSec,0.95,0.9999978991308068
35,Which one of the following options is the illegitimate DHCP server that is referred to in the context of a DHCP server-based attack? Select one choice.,"a. A sitting duck server
b. A rogue DHCP server
c. A target server
d. An erroneous server
",,b,b,,"A rogue DHCP server refers to an unauthorized DHCP server on a network that is not under the administrative control of the network staff. This server can issue incorrect IP addresses, gateways, or other network information, leading to denial of service or man-in-the-middle attacks.",['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/dynamic-address-allocation-resolution/113336-rogue-dhcp.html'],1,NetSec,1,1.0
36,What is one way of mitigating DHCP attacks by using a Cisco switch? Select one choice.,"a. VLAN segmentation
b. MAC address security
c. DHCP snooping
d. DHCP authentication""
",,c,c,,"DHCP snooping is a security feature on switches that acts as a firewall between untrusted hosts and trusted DHCP servers. It does so by filtering out untrusted DHCP messages and by building and maintaining a DHCP snooping binding table. This table contains the MAC address to IP address bindings of clients, which can be used to prevent certain types of DHCP attacks, such as DHCP spoofing or starvation attacks.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12-2SX/configuration/guide/book/snoodhcp.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/dynamic-address-allocation-resolution/27470-100.html']",1,NetSec,0.95,0.9999996871837189
