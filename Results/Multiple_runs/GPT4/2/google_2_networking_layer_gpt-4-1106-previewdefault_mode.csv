b. 256 addresses
c. 1 address
d. 16,777,216 addresses
",,b,b,,"A class C network is designed to accommodate small networks with a maximum of 256 IP addresses. In a class C network, the first three octets (24 bits) are used for the network identifier, and the last octet (8 bits) is used for host addresses. Since 2^8 equals 256, a class C network can have 256 addresses. However, one address is used for the network identifier and one for the broadcast address, leaving 254 usable IP addresses for hosts.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classful_network', 'https://www.iana.org/']",1,google_2_networking_layer,1,0.9999953958625991

b. service type field
c. fragmentation offset field
d. total length field
",,a,a,,"The flag field in the IP header is used to control or identify fragments. It includes bits that indicate whether the datagram can be fragmented and whether it is the last fragment.

b. ARP
c. network
d. MAC addresses
",,c,c,,"The IP address assigned to a device depends on the network to which it is connected. IP addresses are logically assigned to network interfaces based on the network's addressing scheme and subnetting. This is typically managed by a DHCP server within the network that assigns IP addresses dynamically, or through static IP address assignment, where network administrators manually configure the IP settings.","['https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc791.html', 'https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2131.html']",1,google_2_networking_layer,1,0.9999992103693117

b. Classful Identification Routing
c. Class Interconnect Destination Routing
d. Classless Inter-Domain Routing

c. 192.168.1.0/24
d. 192.168.1.0\24
",,c,c,,"CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation is a compact representation of an IP address and its associated network mask. CIDR notation uses a slash ('/') to separate the IP address from the network prefix. In CIDR notation, the network prefix is represented by a number that indicates how many bits of the address constitute the prefix (or network portion). Option 'c' correctly shows the CIDR notation for an IP address with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, which corresponds to a prefix length of 24 bits.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing', 'https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4632']",1,google_2_networking_layer,1,0.9999998063873687
28,How many octets does a subnet mask have?,"a. 1
b. 3
c. 4
d. 2
",,c,c,,"A subnet mask is used in IP networking to designate which portion of an address refers to the network and which part refers to the host. Subnet masks are 32 bits in length and are typically represented as four octets, with each octet consisting of 8 bits.

The 1s represent the network (or subnet) portion of the address, while the 0s represent the host portion.

b. 12
c. 4
d. 2
",,d,d,,"In every network, there are always at least two host IDs that cannot be used for assigning to devices. The first address in any network is the network address, which is used to identify the network itself and cannot be assigned to any individual host.

b. Distance-Vector Protocols
c. Hypertext Transfer Protocol
d. Transmission Control Protocol
",,"a,b","a,b",,"Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) are used to exchange routing information within a single autonomous system. There are two primary types of IGPs: Link State Routing Protocols and Distance-Vector Protocols. Link State Routing Protocols, such as OSPF and IS-IS, work by having routers learn the entire network topology to compute the shortest path to each node. Distance-Vector Protocols, like RIP and EIGRP, work by having each router share its routing table with its immediate neighbors. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) are not routing protocols; HTTP is an application layer protocol used for transmitting web pages, and TCP is a core protocol of the Internet Protocol Suite used for reliable data transmission.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_gateway_protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-state_routing_protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance-vector_routing_protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol']",1,google_2_networking_layer,1,1.0

d. The IANA
",,a,a,,"Non-routable address spaces, also known as private IP addresses, are defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and can be used by anyone within private networks. These addresses are not routable on the global internet, which means they are not assigned to any specific organization and cannot be reached directly from outside their local network.
