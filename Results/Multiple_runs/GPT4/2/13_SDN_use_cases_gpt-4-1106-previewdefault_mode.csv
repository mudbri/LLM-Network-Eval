95,What are some benefits to using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Host configuration is simpler, since all hosts are visible from a single large Ethernet topology.
b. Forwarding on physical MAC addresses is simpler, since both the data center network topology and hosts' physical MAC addresses are hierarchical.
c. IP routing does not need to be reconfigured when physical or virtual machines move from one part of the network to another.
d. Scaling problems are simpler, since all hosts are configured on a single, flat topology.
e. Load balancing is easier on a layer-2 topology than on a layer 3 topology.
",,"a,c","a,c,d",,"Using a layer-2 MAC topology in a data center can offer several benefits. Option (a) is correct because in a layer-2 network, host configuration can be simpler due to the flat nature of the network where all hosts appear to be on the same local network segment. Option (c) is correct because, in a layer-2 environment, IP routing does not need to be reconfigured when machines move around within the network since they maintain the same IP address and MAC address regardless of their physical or virtual location. Option (d) is correct because scaling can be simpler in a flat network topology since adding hosts does not require changes to the IP routing structure. However, this benefit comes with caveats, as large layer-2 networks can have their own scaling issues due to things like broadcast traffic. Option (b) is incorrect because MAC addresses are not hierarchical by nature, and forwarding based on MAC addresses in a large, flat network can become complex. Option (e) is incorrect because load balancing can be achieved on both layer-2 and layer-3 topologies, and it is not necessarily easier on a layer-2 topology; in fact, layer-3 networks can provide more sophisticated load balancing techniques using IP routing.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise/design-zone-data-centers/design-guide-content.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch#Layer_2', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)']",0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,0.9986528197101878
96,"In PortLand, what are the reasons for assigning hosts pseudo-MAC addresses, as opposed to simply forwarding traffic on physical MAC addresses? Select all that apply.","a. Hosts in the data-center network topology are more vulnerable to attack if they expose their actual physical MAC addresses, rather than having a layer of indirection.
b. It is very difficult to load balance traffic using physical MAC addresses; pseudo MAC addresses make it possible to assign traffic to destination IP addresses.
c. Without pseudo-MAC addresses, switches would have to update forwarding state whenever hosts with a particular MAC address moved from one portion of the topology to another.
d. Forwarding loops are be more common in a flat layer-2 topology than they are in a topology with hierarchical pseudo MAC addresses.
e. In a flat layer-2 topology, switches cannot know on which port to forward traffic without maintaining switch tables for each MAC address, since MAC addresses are flat, not hierarchical.
",,"c,e","a,c,e",,"PortLand is a network fabric for data centers that aims to combine the benefits of both flat Layer 2 networks and hierarchical Layer 3 networks. The reasons for assigning pseudo-MAC addresses in PortLand are as follows:

a. One of the reasons for using pseudo-MAC addresses is indeed to provide a layer of indirection, which can help in hiding the actual physical MAC addresses of hosts, potentially improving security against certain types of attacks that rely on knowledge of the physical MAC addresses.

b. The statement about load balancing is not directly related to the use of pseudo MAC addresses in PortLand. Load balancing can be achieved through other means and is not a primary reason for using pseudo MACs.

c. Pseudo-MAC addresses help maintain a stable forwarding state in the presence of host mobility. If a host moves, its pseudo-MAC address can remain the same, reducing the need for switches to update their forwarding state.

d. Forwarding loops are not directly addressed by the use of pseudo MAC addresses. The control protocols and the design of the network fabric are responsible for preventing forwarding loops.

e. Hierarchical pseudo MAC addresses allow switches to forward traffic efficiently without maintaining large switch tables for each MAC address. This is because the hierarchy in the pseudo MAC addresses can be leveraged to make forwarding decisions, similar to IP routing.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Route', 'https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sigcomm09/tech/full_papers/niranjan.pdf', 'https://www.sigcomm.org/sites/default/files/ccr/papers/2009/October/1594977-1592585.pdf']",0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.95,0.500440508864134
97,What are the steps involved in the Proxy ARP process that PortLand's Fabric Manager runs?,"a. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns returns PMAC directly to the end host.
b. Edge switch sends ARP query to fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch updates its local PMAC mapping table.
c. Host sends ARP query, fabric manager intercepts ARP query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to end host.
d. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to the host.
e. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch returns PMAC to end host.
",,e,e,,"In the Proxy ARP process used by PortLand's Fabric Manager, when a host sends an ARP query for a destination, the edge switch intercepts the ARP query. Instead of broadcasting it throughout the network, the edge switch forwards the query to the Fabric Manager. The Fabric Manager then consults its Physical MAC (PMAC) mapping table to determine the correct PMAC for the destination. Once the Fabric Manager has the PMAC, it sends this information back to the edge switch, which in turn updates its local PMAC mapping table and returns the PMAC to the end host, allowing the host to communicate with the destination.",['https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/nsdi09/tech/full_papers/niranjan_mysore/niranjan_mysore.pdf'],1,13_SDN_use_cases,0.95,0.9569718431096526
98,"What are some of the disadvantages of today's interdomain routing protocol, BGP? Select all that apply.","a. ISPs cannot load-balance traffic across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix.
b. Routing and forwarding decisions are only based on IP prefix, not on a broader range of traffic flow attributes.
c. ISPs can only influence route selection through indirect mechanisms (e.g., prepending), rather than directly manipulating the forwarding table entries in switches.
d. ISPs cannot express preference of one route over another, given multiple routes to a destination.

ISPs can influence route selection through indirect mechanisms such as AS path prepending, local preference, and MEDs, but they cannot directly manipulate the forwarding table entries in other autonomous systems' switches (c). Furthermore, ISPs can influence the routing decisions of their immediate BGP neighbors through these mechanisms, but they have limited ability to influence the entire end-to-end path of a route across multiple ASes (e).

103,What are some of the motivations for applying software defined networking in home networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Better performance, since control decisions can be made from a well-provisioned server, as opposed to an under-provisioned router.

a. Better performance: SDN can centralize control decisions to a powerful server rather than relying on less capable hardware like a traditional router.

c. Service provider access: SDN can allow multiple service providers to access the home network infrastructure to deliver various applications and services, making it easier to integrate and manage these services. 

e. Fine-grained control: SDN provides the ability to dynamically adjust the network's forwarding behavior based on real-time conditions, such as managing a device that consumes excessive bandwidth.
