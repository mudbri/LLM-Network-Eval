95,What are some benefits to using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Host configuration is simpler, since all hosts are visible from a single large Ethernet topology.
b. Forwarding on physical MAC addresses is simpler, since both the data center network topology and hosts' physical MAC addresses are hierarchical.
c. IP routing does not need to be reconfigured when physical or virtual machines move from one part of the network to another.
d. Scaling problems are simpler, since all hosts are configured on a single, flat topology.
e. Load balancing is easier on a layer-2 topology than on a layer 3 topology.
",,"a,c","a,c,d",,"Using a layer-2 MAC topology in a data center can offer several benefits. Option (a) is correct because in a layer-2 network, host configuration can be simpler due to the flat nature of the network where all hosts appear to be on the same local network segment. Option (c) is correct because, in a layer-2 environment, IP addresses do not need to change when a host moves to a different switch within the same layer-2 domain, which means IP routing reconfiguration is not required. Option (d) is correct because a single, flat topology can be easier to scale out without the need for complex routing protocols or configurations. Option (b) is incorrect because MAC addresses are not hierarchical by nature, and their flat nature can actually complicate forwarding in large networks. Option (e) is incorrect because load balancing can be performed on both layer-2 and layer-3 topologies, and it is not necessarily easier on a layer-2 topology; in fact, layer-3 can provide more flexibility in load balancing decisions based on IP routing.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise/data-center-designs-cloud-computing/index.html', 'https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/day-one-books/DO_DataCenterBook.pdf']",0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.95,0.9968740973519552
96,"In PortLand, what are the reasons for assigning hosts pseudo-MAC addresses, as opposed to simply forwarding traffic on physical MAC addresses? Select all that apply.","a. Hosts in the data-center network topology are more vulnerable to attack if they expose their actual physical MAC addresses, rather than having a layer of indirection.
b. It is very difficult to load balance traffic using physical MAC addresses; pseudo MAC addresses make it possible to assign traffic to destination IP addresses.
c. Without pseudo-MAC addresses, switches would have to update forwarding state whenever hosts with a particular MAC address moved from one portion of the topology to another.
d. Forwarding loops are be more common in a flat layer-2 topology than they are in a topology with hierarchical pseudo MAC addresses.
e. In a flat layer-2 topology, switches cannot know on which port to forward traffic without maintaining switch tables for each MAC address, since MAC addresses are flat, not hierarchical.
",,"c,e","c,e",,"PortLand is a network design that aims to improve scalability and manageability of large data center networks. The reasons for assigning pseudo-MAC addresses include: 

- To maintain a stable forwarding state even when hosts move, because the pseudo-MAC addresses allow the network to abstract the location of the host from its address (c). This means that the switch does not need to update its forwarding state for the host's MAC address if the host moves to a different part of the network.

- To enable better scalability in terms of switch table size and to simplify the forwarding process. In a flat layer-2 network, switches must keep track of each individual MAC address and the corresponding port, which can become unwieldy in large networks. Hierarchical pseudo MAC addresses allow for more efficient forwarding and can reduce the size of the switch tables (e).

The other options are not directly related to the use of pseudo-MAC addresses in PortLand. While load balancing and security are important concerns in data center networks, they are not the primary reasons for using pseudo-MAC addresses in PortLand. Additionally, forwarding loops are more related to the spanning tree protocol and other network design issues rather than the use of pseudo-MAC addresses.","['https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sigcomm09/tech/full_papers/niranjan_mysore.pdf', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking']",1,13_SDN_use_cases,0.95,0.6629253230878576
97,What are the steps involved in the Proxy ARP process that PortLand's Fabric Manager runs?,"a. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns returns PMAC directly to the end host.
b. Edge switch sends ARP query to fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch updates its local PMAC mapping table.
c. Host sends ARP query, fabric manager intercepts ARP query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to end host.
d. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to the host.
e. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch returns PMAC to end host.
",,e,e,,"In the Proxy ARP process used by PortLand's Fabric Manager, the following steps occur: The host sends an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) query to resolve an IP address to a MAC address. The edge switch, which is part of the PortLand fabric, intercepts this ARP query. Instead of broadcasting it, the edge switch redirects the query to the fabric manager. The fabric manager then consults the PMAC (Pseudo MAC) mapping table to find the corresponding PMAC for the given IP address. Once the fabric manager has the PMAC, it sends this information back to the edge switch. Finally, the edge switch sends the PMAC to the end host, completing the ARP resolution process without flooding the network with ARP requests.","[""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5289152 - 'PortLand: A Scalable Fault-Tolerant Layer 2 Data Center Network Fabric' which describes the PortLand system and its use of Proxy ARP.""]",1,13_SDN_use_cases,0.95,0.9548271763984253
98,"What are some of the disadvantages of today's interdomain routing protocol, BGP? Select all that apply.","a. ISPs cannot load-balance traffic across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix.
b. Routing and forwarding decisions are only based on IP prefix, not on a broader range of traffic flow attributes.
c. ISPs can only influence route selection through indirect mechanisms (e.g., prepending), rather than directly manipulating the forwarding table entries in switches.
d. ISPs cannot express preference of one route over another, given multiple routes to a destination.
e. ISPs can only influence the routing decisions of their immediate neighbor, not the entire end-to-end path.
",,"b,c,e","b,c,e",,"The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the current interdomain routing protocol used on the internet. While BGP is robust and scalable, it does have some disadvantages. BGP's routing and forwarding decisions are based only on IP prefix (choice b), not on a broader range of traffic flow attributes like the type of service or other quality of service metrics. ISPs can influence route selection only through indirect mechanisms such as route prepending, local preference, and AS-path manipulation (choice c). They cannot directly manipulate the forwarding table entries in switches, which would allow for more granular control.

Similarly, it would match the source IP of the child's computer and the destination port for BitTorrent, and then apply a dynamic policy that rate limits the traffic if VOIP is active.
