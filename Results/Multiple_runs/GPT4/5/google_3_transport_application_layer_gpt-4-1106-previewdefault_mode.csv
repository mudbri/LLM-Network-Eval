36,What ordering of TCP flags make up the Three-Way Handshake?,"a. SYN, ACK, FIN
b. SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK
c. FIN, FIN/ACK, ACK
d. SYN, ACK, SYN, ACK
",,b,b,,"The Three-Way Handshake in TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is used to establish a connection between a client and server. It involves three steps: (1) the client sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server to initiate a connection, (2) the server responds with a SYN/ACK (synchronize/acknowledge) packet to acknowledge the receipt of the SYN and to send its own SYN, and (3) the client sends an ACK (acknowledge) packet back to the server to acknowledge the receipt of the server's SYN, completing the handshake. Therefore, the correct order of TCP flags for the Three-Way Handshake is SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Connection_establishment', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793']",1,google_3_transport_application_layer,1,1.0
37,"Transport layer protocols, like TCP and UDP, introduce the concept of a port. How many bits are in a port field?","a. 16
b. 4
c. 32
d. 8
",,a,a,,"In both TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol), the port field is 16 bits long. This allows for 2^16 or 65,536 possible port numbers, ranging from 0 to 65535.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol']",1,google_3_transport_application_layer,1,1.0
38,A device that blocks traffic that meets certain criteria is known as a ________.,"a. Hub
b. Router
c. Switch
d. Firewall
",,d,d,,"A firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies. At its most basic, a firewall is essentially a barrier between a private internal network and the public Internet. Its main purpose is to block malicious traffic requests and data packets while allowing legitimate traffic through.",['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/firewalls/what-is-a-firewall.html'],1,google_3_transport_application_layer,1,1.0
39,Which TCP flag is used to make the listening program respond immediately?,"a. ACK
b. PSH
c. URG
d. RST
",,b,b,,The PSH (Push) flag in TCP is used to indicate that the data should be pushed to the receiving application as soon as possible. This is often interpreted by TCP stacks as an instruction to bypass the buffer and make the data available to the listening program immediately. It is used to ensure that the receiving end processes the data in a timely manner without waiting for the buffer to fill up.,"['https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc793.txt', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol']",1,google_3_transport_application_layer,0.95,0.9999956342685299

b. Ephemeral ports
c. Sockets
d. System ports
",,b,b,,"Ephemeral ports are temporary ports assigned by a computer's operating system. They are used by network client applications when initiating a connection to a server, especially when the client-side port number is not important or is chosen randomly for the duration of the connection. The range for these ports is typically from 49152 to 65535, which is the highest range in the spectrum of available ports (0 to 65535).","['https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeral_port']",1,google_3_transport_application_layer,1,0.9999967070975216
41,"Unlike our five-layer model, the OSI network model adds two more layers on top of the Application Layer. Select examples of these new layers below.","a. The compression layer
b. The session layer
c. The interconnection layer
d. The presentation layer
",,"b,d","b,d",,"The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement networking protocols in seven layers. The OSI model adds two layers on top of the Application Layer that are not explicitly defined in the simplified five-layer model (which typically includes the physical, data link, network, transport, and application layers). These two additional layers are the Session Layer and the Presentation Layer. The Session Layer (Layer 5) establishes, manages, and terminates connections between applications. The Presentation Layer (Layer 6) is responsible for the translation, encryption, and compression of data.","['https://www.lifewire.com/layers-of-the-osi-model-illustrated-818017', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model']",1,google_3_transport_application_layer,1,0.9999988527586581
42,An example of something that operates at the application layer is:,"a. UDP
b. A router
c. TCP
d. A web browser
",,d,d,,"The application layer is the topmost layer in both the OSI model of computer networking and the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP). It is where end-user software operates. A web browser is an example of application layer software because it enables users to interact with web content, which involves network services like HTTP or HTTPS. UDP and TCP operate at the transport layer, which is responsible for host-to-host communication. A router operates at the network layer, which is responsible for packet forwarding including routing through intermediate routers.","['https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/application-layer', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13769-5.html']",1,google_3_transport_application_layer,1,0.9999998063873687
44,Which part of the operating system does the application use to communicate the need to establish a TCP connection?,"a. Networking stack
b. ARP message
c. The source port
d. The router
",,a,a,,"The networking stack, also known as the network stack or TCP/IP stack, is the part of the operating system that provides networking functionality. Applications use the networking stack to communicate with the network, including establishing TCP connections. The stack is responsible for the implementation of the TCP/IP protocols and provides the necessary interfaces for applications to send and receive data over the network.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_stack', 'https://www.techopedia.com/definition/25597/network-stack']",1,google_3_transport_application_layer,1,1.0

b. The payload section of the IP Datagram
c. The payload of the TCP segment
d. The header of the Ethernet frame
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"In the TCP/IP networking model, the data that an application wants to send is encapsulated in the payload sections at various layers as it moves down the stack. At the Transport layer (TCP), the application data is placed in the payload of the TCP segment. Then, at the Internet layer (IP), the TCP segment itself becomes the payload of the IP datagram. Finally, at the Link layer (Ethernet in this case), the IP datagram is encapsulated in the payload section of the Ethernet frame.
