32,What are some of the reasons that it is difficult to deploy improvements to BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. Changes are necessarily incremental because of the large installed base of routers that already run BGP.
b. BGP is implemented in hardware, so deploying changes to BGP requires changes on the timescale of hardware development cycles.
c. Deplyoing changes to BGP requires coordination across potentially tens of thousands of ASes in the Internet.
d. Only a few vendors implement BGP, and deploying changes requires convincing those vendors to change the protocol.
e. Deploying changes requires coordination in standards bodies such as the IETF.
",,"a,c,e","a,c,e",,"Deploying improvements to BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is challenging for several reasons. First, BGP has a large installed base of routers, and any changes must be incremental to avoid disrupting the existing infrastructure, hence option (a) is correct. Second, changes to BGP require coordination across a vast number of Autonomous Systems (ASes), which can be tens of thousands, making it a complex logistical endeavor, so option (c) is correct. Lastly, BGP is a standardized protocol, and any changes to it require discussion, agreement, and coordination within standards bodies like the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), making option (e) correct. Option (b) is incorrect because BGP is not implemented in hardware; it is a routing protocol typically implemented in router software, and changes do not necessarily require hardware development cycles. Option (d) is incorrect because there are multiple vendors that implement BGP, and while vendor cooperation is necessary, it is not a matter of there being only a few vendors.","['https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4271', 'https://www.ietf.org/', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/5816-bgp-ios.html']",1,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.95,0.9051756225639791
33,Which of the following are true about the RCP? Select all that apply.,"a. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, the RCP controller for an AS sees all routes for all destinations that an AS learns from neighboring ASes.
b. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, there is no need for ASes to use BGP to exchange routes.
c. In an RCP deployment, routers no longer have to compute routes.
d. The RCP controller operates just like a route reflector would, selecting a single best route for each destination for all client routers.
e. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, a single AS can benefit from deploying RCP even if no other ASes deploy RCP.
",,"c,e","a,c,e",,"The Routing Control Platform (RCP) is a concept in the context of Software Defined Networking (SDN) that separates the control plane from the data plane for routing protocols. Here are the explanations for the selected choices:

a. True. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, the RCP controller for an Autonomous System (AS) does indeed see all routes for all destinations that the AS learns from neighboring ASes. This is because the RCP is designed to centralize the control plane, allowing it to have a global view of the network.

b. False. Even with RCP, Autonomous Systems still use BGP to exchange routing information. RCP does not eliminate the need for BGP between ASes; it changes the way BGP is processed within an AS.

c. True. In an RCP deployment, routers delegate the responsibility of computing routes to the RCP controller. This is a fundamental aspect of SDN, where the control plane (including route computation) is centralized in the controller.

d. False. The RCP controller does not operate just like a route reflector. While a route reflector selects a single best route for each destination for its clients, an RCP controller can potentially compute customized routes for different routers based on a more comprehensive view of the network.

e. True. A single AS can benefit from deploying RCP even if no other ASes deploy RCP because the benefits of centralized control and optimized routing decisions can be realized within a single AS independently of other ASes.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/software-defined-standards/models/', 'https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-rtgwg-rcp-00.txt', 'https://www.sigcomm.org/sites/default/files/ccr/papers/2011/January/1921738-1921743.pdf']",0,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.95,0.9736998413204341

b. Implementing network-wide policy sometimes causes the routers themeselves to have to carry state.
c. Each router operates and makes decisions based only on a local view of network state.
d. BGP routing has a single point of failure.
e. It is not possible to perform traffic engineering with conventional BGP.
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"In the absence of a Routing Control Platform (RCP), traditional network management using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) has several characteristics and limitations. Here are the reasons for selecting the given options:

a. BGP's interaction with the underlying Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) can indeed result in persistent forwarding loops. This is because BGP does not have complete visibility into the IGP metrics and may make decisions that are suboptimal or even conflicting with the IGP, leading to potential routing loops.

b. Implementing network-wide policies can require routers to carry additional state information. This is because each router needs to maintain the state necessary to enforce the policies, which can increase the complexity and resource usage on the routers.

c. BGP routers operate based on a local view of network state. Each router's decision-making process is based on the information available from its directly connected neighbors and the best paths advertised to it, without a global view of the network.

Option d is incorrect because BGP does not inherently have a single point of failure; it is a distributed protocol where multiple routers work independently to determine the best paths. Option e is also incorrect because it is possible to perform traffic engineering with conventional BGP, although it may be more complex and less flexible than with more advanced techniques such as Software Defined Networking (SDN).","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/116377-technote-bgp-00.html', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4271', 'https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/concept/policy-bgp-understanding.html']",1,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.95,0.9944073572477458

b. The second phase of RCP deployment offers potential benefits such as reduced routing table size.
c. In the second phase of deployment, the RCP controller sees all routes for every destination that neighboring ASes advertise.
d. The second phase of deployment requires fewer BGP sessions at the RCP controller than the first phase, thus improving scalability of the controller.
e. In the second phase of RCP deployment, ASes do not need to use BGP to exchange routes with one another.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"The second phase of RCP (Routing Control Platform) deployment typically involves the RCP controller having a more comprehensive view of the network. This means that the controller would see all routes for every destination that neighboring ASes (Autonomous Systems) advertise, which aligns with option 'c'. Additionally, with the RCP taking on more routing control, it can potentially optimize the routing tables, leading to reduced routing table size as mentioned in option 'b'. Option 'a' is incorrect because coordination with neighboring ASes is generally required to ensure proper routing and policy compliance. Option 'd' is not necessarily true as the number of BGP sessions could vary depending on the specific deployment and design of the RCP. Option 'e' is incorrect because ASes would still need to use BGP or another routing protocol to exchange routes, as RCP does not eliminate the need for inter-AS routing protocols.","['https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos561/papers/rcp-sigcomm05.pdf', 'https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4271.txt']",1,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.9,0.9203681945821285

e. Simpler routers and switches
",,"c,d,e","a,b,c,d",,"The 4D architecture for network control, which stands for decision, dissemination, discovery, and data, aims to simplify the control plane with several goals in mind. Improved security (a) is a goal because a simpler control plane can be better understood, monitored, and protected. The inherent robustness of the control plane (b) is enhanced when complexity is reduced, as there are fewer points of failure and interactions are more predictable. Simpler management systems (c) are a result of a less complicated control plane, making it easier for network operators to manage the network. Faster innovation (d) is facilitated by a simpler control plane because it allows for quicker implementation and testing of new ideas.

38,What are some examples of how a separate decision plane in the 4D architecture can amortize system overhead? Select all that apply.,"a. Maintaining a single table in memory of AS paths that are learned across all BGP sessions in the AS, and using references into that table for specific routers (and routing decisions), to save memory.
b. If secure BGP were deployed, verifying the signatures on the AS paths of routes received from neighbors.
c. Keeping track of topology information.
d. Performing route computation on behalf of all the routers in the AS.
e. Performing inbound traffic engineering on a set of links in a coordinated fashion.
",,"a,b,c","a,c,d,e",,"The 4D architecture separates the decision logic from the protocols, which enables centralized computation and management. This can lead to more efficient use of resources. For example, maintaining a single table of AS paths (a) can save memory across the network because each router doesn't have to store and manage its own complete set of paths. Keeping track of topology information (c) can be more efficiently handled by a centralized decision plane, which has a global view of the network and can avoid the overhead of each router independently discovering and storing this information. Performing route computation on behalf of all routers in the AS (d) can reduce the computational load on individual routers and allow for more optimized routing decisions across the network. Lastly, performing inbound traffic engineering in a coordinated fashion (e) allows for more efficient use of network resources and can prevent suboptimal decisions that might arise if each router attempted to perform traffic engineering independently. Option (b) is not an example of amortizing system overhead through a separate decision plane, as verifying signatures is a security function that does not inherently reduce overhead by being centralized.","['The 4D Project: An Architectural Framework for Network Control and Management', 'Software Defined Networking (SDN): Layers and Architecture Terminology']",0,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.95,0.7826194879078052
