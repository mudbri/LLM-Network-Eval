218,Which of the following configuration management tools uses agentless architecture for managing network devices?,"a. Ansible
b. Puppet
c. Chef
d. Ansible and Puppet
e. Puppet and Chef
",,a,a,,"Ansible uses an agentless architecture for managing network devices, which means that it does not require any agents to be installed on the nodes it manages. Instead, it uses SSH for communication with the managed nodes. Puppet and Chef, on the other hand, typically require an agent to be installed on the managed nodes for configuration management tasks.","['https://www.ansible.com/overview/how-ansible-works', 'https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/architecture.html', 'https://docs.chef.io/chef_overview/']",1,chapter13_network_automation,0.95,0.9999917005724405

b. Management plane
c. Control Plane
d. None of the above
",,a,a,,"The action of examining a frame's destination MAC address and forwarding it out of a specific port is part of the data plane (also known as the forwarding plane) of a switch. The data plane is responsible for the actual forwarding of packets based on Layer 2 information, such as MAC addresses.
