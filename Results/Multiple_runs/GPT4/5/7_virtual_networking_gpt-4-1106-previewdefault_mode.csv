54,Which of the following properties are characteristics of virtual networks (but not necessarily characteristics of SDN). Select all that apply.,"a. Separates the data and control plane.
b. Refactors network control so that network behavior is controlled from a single logically centralized controller.
c. Separates logical and physical networks.
d. Often deployed in data center networks to allow multiple tenants to share physical network infrastructure.
e. Abstracts the details of the physical network.
",,"c,d,e","c,d,e",,"Virtual networks are characterized by the separation of logical and physical networks (c), which allows for the creation of multiple virtual networks that can operate on the same physical infrastructure. This is particularly useful in data center networks (d) where it enables multiple tenants to share the same physical network infrastructure without interfering with each other. Virtual networks also abstract the details of the physical network (e), allowing users to interact with a simplified virtual representation of the network without having to manage the complexities of the physical network components. Separating the data and control plane (a) and refactoring network control to a single logically centralized controller (b) are characteristics specifically associated with Software Defined Networking (SDN), not virtual networks in general.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_network', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/virtualization/definitions/what-is-network-virtualization/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.95,0.9997753525150258
55,Which of the following are possible ways of creating virtual links in a virtual network? Select all that apply.,"a. A wide-area tunnel, whereby an IP packet is encapsulated in an MPLS tunnel by attaching an MPLS header to the packet.
b. Longest-prefix match forwarding on an IP router.
c. A wide-area tunnel, whereby an Ethernet packet sent between two virtual machines is encapsulated in an IP packet.
d. VLAN switching based on a VLAN tag.
e. Pairs of virtual Ethernet interfaces, where one end of the Ethernet interface pair resides in the virtual environment, and the other resides in the root namespace on the host machine.
",,"a,c,d,e","a,c,d,e",,"Virtual links can be created in several ways in a virtual network environment. Option (a) describes an MPLS tunnel, which is a method for creating a virtual link by encapsulating IP packets with an MPLS header. Option (c) refers to creating a tunnel by encapsulating Ethernet packets in IP packets, which is another common way to create a virtual link over a wide area. Option (d) refers to VLAN switching, which allows for the creation of virtual links within a local area network by tagging Ethernet frames with a VLAN identifier. Option (e) describes the use of virtual Ethernet interfaces to create a link between the virtual environment and the host machine's root namespace, which is a technique used in virtual networking. Option (b), on the other hand, is a method of forwarding IP packets based on the longest prefix match in routing tables, which is not a method of creating virtual links.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotocol_Label_Switching', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunneling_protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_network_interface']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.95,0.9999302090614509
56,Which of the following are true of the Mininet network emulator? Select all that apply.,"a. It requires running OpenFlow-capable switches.
b. It is difficult to use it to route traffic for real services.
c. Mininet only allows users to create three types of topologies: linear, tree, and single-switch topologies.
d. It can create an emulation that runs across multiple physically distributed nodes.
e. All of the hosts in the topology must run the same underlying operating system.
",,"b,e","a,e",,"Mininet is a popular network emulator that allows the creation of a virtual network for the purpose of testing and development. It does indeed require running OpenFlow-capable switches (a) since it is designed to work with Software-Defined Networking (SDN) protocols, of which OpenFlow is a primary example. As for the hosts in the topology, they are typically lightweight virtual machines or processes that share the same kernel as the host operating system, so they must run the same underlying operating system (e). The other statements are not true: Mininet is not inherently difficult to use for routing traffic for real services (b), and it is not limited to only three types of topologies (c). Users can create custom topologies as needed. Lastly, Mininet emulations are generally contained within a single machine, and it does not natively support running across multiple physically distributed nodes (d), although there are advanced setups and extensions that could allow distributed emulation.","['https://mininet.org/', 'http://mininet.org/walkthrough/', 'https://github.com/mininet/mininet']",0,7_virtual_networking,0.95,0.3938029612521044

b. An emulator makes it possible to ""port"" experiments from one machine to another.
c. An emulator allows the experimenter run real software on each of the nodes in the emulation.
d. An emulation is easier to debug than a simulation.
e. Every run of the emulator will yield exactly the same results, resulting in reproducible experiments.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"An emulator allows for real software and network systems to be run and tested within a controlled environment, which is a significant benefit over simulation. This means that the actual code can be executed on each node within the emulation, providing a more accurate representation of how software would behave in a real-world scenario (c). Additionally, emulation environments can often be transferred or 'ported' from one physical machine to another, which is useful for sharing experimental setups or for moving to more powerful hardware if needed (b).","['https://www.nsnam.org/overview/what-is-ns-3/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_emulator', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/network-emulation']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.9,0.9997404078535435

b. Assigning custom IP addresses to each node in the topology.
c. Assigning IP addresses to each node in the topology using a DHCP server.
d. Running performance measurement tools (e.g., iperf, wget) between nodes.
e. ""Shaping"" a link between two nodes to a particular traffic rate.
",,"b,c,d,e","b,c,d,e",,"Mininet is a network emulator which can create a virtual network with virtual hosts, switches, controllers, and links. It runs real Linux kernel, switch, and application code on a single machine, for development and testing. Here is what Mininet can do from the given options:

b. Assigning custom IP addresses to each node in the topology: Mininet allows users to assign custom IP addresses to virtual hosts within the emulated network.

 c. Assigning IP addresses to each node in the topology using a DHCP server: Mininet supports the use of DHCP servers within the emulated network to assign IP addresses dynamically to nodes.

d. Running performance measurement tools (e.g., iperf, wget) between nodes: Mininet supports running standard network performance measurement tools between nodes in the emulated network.

e. 'Shaping' a link between two nodes to a particular traffic rate: Mininet allows users to control the bandwidth, delay, loss, and queue size of links between nodes to simulate different network conditions.

a. Measuring the latency between a host in San Francisco and a host in Los Angeles: While Mininet can simulate network latency, it does not inherently understand real-world geography or distances between locations like San Francisco and Los Angeles. It can simulate the latency that might be characteristic of such a link, but it does not measure actual latency between real-world locations.","['http://mininet.org/', 'https://github.com/mininet/mininet']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.95,0.6202045045989101
59,Which of the following functions does FlowVisor enable? Select all that apply.,"a. Allowing two different researchers to implement and deploy different load balancing applications for all traffic between the same source-destination pair.
b. Allowing two controllers to control traffic on distinct VLANs.
c. Allowing two different researchers to implement and deploy different Web load balancing applications for port 80 traffic.
d. Allowing two different researchers to implement and deploy control mechanisms for two distinct applications.
e. Allowing one controller to control TCP traffic and one controller to control UDP traffic.
",,"b,d,e","b,d,e",,"FlowVisor is a special purpose OpenFlow controller that acts as a transparent proxy between OpenFlow switches and multiple OpenFlow controllers. It creates slices of network resources and delegates control of each slice to a different controller. This enables various experiments or applications to run concurrently on different logical slices of the network. Option 'b' is correct because FlowVisor can allow two controllers to manage traffic on distinct VLANs, effectively slicing the network by VLAN tags. Option 'd' is correct because it can enable two different researchers to deploy control mechanisms for two distinct applications on separate slices of the network. Option 'e' is also correct because FlowVisor can slice the network by traffic type, allowing one controller to manage TCP traffic and another to manage UDP traffic. Option 'a' is incorrect because FlowVisor does not allow two different load balancing applications for all traffic between the same source-destination pair; this would cause conflicts as both applications would try to control the same flow. Option 'c' is also incorrect for the same reason as 'a'; it would not allow two different Web load balancing applications for port 80 traffic without causing conflicts.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/cs-flowvisor.pdf', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915004118']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.95,0.5239814923424583

a. Easier transition to IPv6 in data-center networks - Network virtualization platforms can abstract the underlying IP infrastructure, making transitions like IPv4 to IPv6 smoother. 
b. Creating more than 1024 virtual networks - Network virtualization platforms like Nicira's can overcome the limitations of VLAN tagging, which is limited to 4096 IDs, by providing a much larger set of identifiers for network isolation. 
c. Allowing experimental protocols to coincide with a production network - Network virtualization can provide a separate logical networking environment for testing experimental protocols without affecting the production network. 
d. Central management of security policies - These platforms typically offer centralized control over security policies, making it easier to manage and enforce them across the virtual networks. 
e. Dynamic workload placement in multi-tenant data centers - Network virtualization allows for the dynamic placement of workloads in multi-tenant environments by abstracting the physical network and providing flexibility in how virtual networks are configured and connected.","['https://www.vmware.com/products/nsx.html', 'https://www.networkworld.com/article/2165723/vmware-acquisition-of-nicira-to-shift-virtualization-landscape.html', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-is-vmware-nsx/']",0,7_virtual_networking,0.95,0.8907717234983835
61,Select the statement that is most true about the relationship between network virtualization and SDNs.,"a. Network virtualization is a potential enabler for software-defined networks, since the separation of data and control planes first requires the creation of a logical network.
b. Software-defined networking is a potential enabler for virtual networks, since separation of data and control planes makes it easier to manage a logical network topology.
c. Network virtualization is a new concept introduced by Amazon, Nicira, and industry players; it only made sense to talk about network virtualization once central SDN controllers existed.
d. Network virtualization and software-defined networking each enable the other: SDN cannot exist without network virtualization, and network virtualization cannot exist without SDN.
",,b,b,,"Software-defined networking (SDN) is indeed a potential enabler for network virtualization. SDN separates the network's control plane (which makes decisions about where traffic should be sent) from the data plane (which actually sends packets to the selected destination). This separation allows for more flexible network management and is a key concept that enables network virtualization. Network virtualization can exist without SDN, as it has been around in different forms before the advent of SDN, and similarly, SDN does not strictly require network virtualization to function. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that SDN facilitates the management of virtual networks.","['https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/whats-sdn/', 'https://www.networkworld.com/article/2287045/what-is-network-virtualization-.html']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.9,0.9871266634693021
