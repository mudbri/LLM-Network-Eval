204,"The customer edge device is typically a router, that sits at a customer site on MPLS networks and connects to a provider edge router (PE router) to take communications from a customer site to a provider side.","a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",,a,a,,"The statement is true. In MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching) networks, the Customer Edge (CE) device is typically a router located at the customer's premises. It connects to the Provider Edge (PE) router, which is part of the service provider's network.

b. Star
c. Hybrid
d. Partial Mesh
",,a,a,,"A full mesh network design is one where each node in the network has a direct link to every other node. This type of network provides the highest level of redundancy and fault tolerance, as there are multiple paths for data to travel between any two nodes. In contrast, a star network has a central connection point (like a hub or switch) to which all nodes are connected, a hybrid network is a combination of two or more different types of network topologies, and a partial mesh network is one where some nodes are organized in a full mesh scheme but others are not fully interconnected.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/network-management/network-design/200502-Network-Design-Considerations-for-Ente.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking']",1,chapter12_network_design_architecture,1,1.0

208,Which of the following roles of campus switches provides a connection point for end-user devices?,"a. Access
b. Distribution
c. Core
d. Campus
",,a,a,,"In a hierarchical network design, the access layer is where end-user devices connect to the network. The access layer switches provide network access to the user. The distribution layer aggregates the data received from the access layer switches before it is routed to the core layer for transport to other network segments. The core layer is the backbone of the network, handling the high-speed transmission of large amounts of data. The term 'campus' is not specifically a role of a switch but rather refers to the entire enterprise network that is usually within a single geographic location, such as a company's campus.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/what-is-a-campus-network.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/lan-switching/ethernet/17056-ethernet-design.html']",1,chapter12_network_design_architecture,1,0.9999998063873687

The core layer provides a high-speed backbone and is designed to switch packets as fast as possible.

211,Your company plans to start using public cloud service and now you are considering different WAN options. Your main concern is security by keeping the data private while also providing good QoS services. Which of the following options are under consideration? (Choose two answers.),"a. Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider
b. Using an Internet connection without VPN
c. Using an Internet connection with VPN
d. Using an intercloud exchange
",,"a,d","a,c",,"When considering WAN options for connecting to a public cloud service with a focus on security and QoS, the following options are viable: a) Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider ensures that the data remains private as it does not traverse the public internet. This also allows for better QoS since the connection is not shared with other internet traffic. c) Using an Internet connection with VPN provides security by encrypting the data as it traverses the public internet, ensuring privacy and some level of QoS depending on the VPN and underlying internet connection quality. Option b) is not secure as it does not use VPN to encrypt the data, and option d) using an intercloud exchange does not inherently provide security or QoS as it is a mechanism for moving workloads between different cloud providers.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/what-is-sd-wan.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/enterprise-network-security/index.html']",0,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,0.9999944870325964

213,"A company uses a Metro Ethernet WAN with an Ethernet LAN (E-LAN) service, with the company headquarters plus 20 remote sites connected to the service. The enterprise uses OSPF at all sites, with one router connected to the service from each site. Which of the following are true about the Layer 3 details most likely used with this service and design? (Choose all that apply)","a. The WAN uses one IP subnet
b. The WAN uses 20 or more IP subnets
c. A remote site router would have one OSPF neighbor
d. A remote site router would have 20 OSPF neighbors
",,"a,d","a,c",,"An Ethernet LAN (E-LAN) service in a Metro Ethernet environment operates similarly to a traditional LAN. It is designed to connect multiple sites in a point-to-multipoint or multipoint-to-multipoint configuration, where all sites appear to be on the same Ethernet network. This allows for all sites to be on the same IP subnet, which makes the WAN appear to be a single Ethernet LAN to the routers.

Given that all sites appear to be on the same LAN and OSPF is being used, each site would see all other sites as OSPF neighbors. However, because the Metro Ethernet service makes the WAN look like a single Ethernet LAN, OSPF would form neighbor relationships as if all routers were on the same Ethernet network. This means that each router would have a direct neighbor relationship with the headquarters router and not with every other remote site router. Therefore, a remote site router would typically have one OSPF neighbor, the headquarters router, which would act as a hub in a hub-and-spoke OSPF network design.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Enterprise/WAN_and_MAN/EMC_Over.html', 'https://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=680824&seqNum=2', 'https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2328.txt']",0,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,0.998813932065238
