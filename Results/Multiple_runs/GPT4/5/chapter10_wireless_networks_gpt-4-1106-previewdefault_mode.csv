179,"When APs are placed at different geographic locations, they can all be interconnected by a switched infrastructure. The 802.11 standard calls this an extended service set (ESS).","a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",,a,a,,"An Extended Service Set (ESS) is a set of two or more Basic Service Sets (BSSs) that form a single subnetwork. Access Points (APs) in an ESS can be connected through a distribution system, which is typically a wired network infrastructure like Ethernet. This allows seamless roaming for clients within that ESS, as the infrastructure appears as a single network to the wireless client. Therefore, when APs are placed at different geographic locations and interconnected by a switched infrastructure, it does indeed form an ESS as per the 802.11 standards.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless-mobility/wireless-lan-wlan/69340-ess-mbssid-00.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_set_(802.11_network)']",1,chapter10_wireless_networks,0.95,0.9999925349918634

d. Split-MAC
",,d,d,,"A lightweight access point participates in a Split-MAC architecture. In this architecture, the processing of the MAC (Media Access Control) layer is divided between the access point and the wireless LAN controller. The lightweight access point handles real-time MAC operations such as beaconing, probing, and data transmission and reception, while the controller manages non-real-time MAC functions such as authentication, association, and key management. This allows for centralized management and control of multiple access points, simplifying the deployment and maintenance of large wireless networks.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless-mobility/wireless-lan-wlan/213480-understanding-cisco-access-point-archite.html', 'https://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=29803']",1,chapter10_wireless_networks,0.95,0.9990404024085222

e. IP subnet
",,"b,c","a,b",,"When creating a new WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) with a controller's graphical user interface (GUI), you need to specify at least the SSID (Service Set Identifier) and the VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) number.

The VLAN number is necessary to determine which VLAN the wireless clients will be part of, which is important for network segmentation and security. The interface is usually tied to the VLAN configuration and may be required depending on the system, but it is not a parameter that is specified independently when creating a WLAN. The BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier) is a MAC address used to uniquely identify a BSS (Basic Service Set) within an area but is not typically manually configured when setting up a WLAN, as it is derived from the physical device's MAC address.
