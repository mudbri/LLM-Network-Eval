43,Which of the following statements are true about the OpenFlow specification? Select all that apply.,"a. If a switch does not contain a flow table entry that matches a particular packet, the switch forwards the packet to the controller for handling.
b. The main purpose of the OpenFlow control channel is to update flow table entries on switches.
c. The OpenFlow specification provides mechanisms to perform Layer 2 learning across a network of switches.
d. Once a switch has sent one packet for a flow, it must also send all subsequent packets for that flow to the controller.
e. Some versions of the OpenFlow specification allow for performing more than one action on a single packet.
",,"a,b,e","a,b,e",,"The OpenFlow specification is a cornerstone of Software Defined Networking (SDN) that enables the decoupling of the control and data planes. Here's the rationale for the selected choices:

- (a) True. If a switch does not have a matching flow table entry for a packet, the default behavior is to forward the packet to the controller. This is a fundamental aspect of OpenFlow, allowing the controller to make decisions about new flows.

- (b) True. The control channel in OpenFlow is used by the controller to communicate with the switches, primarily to update flow table entries, thereby controlling the behavior of the network.

- (e) True. OpenFlow specifications, particularly from version 1.1 onwards, allow for multiple actions to be specified for packets. This means that a packet can be instructed to undergo a series of actions, like being forwarded to a particular port, modified, or even sent to multiple ports (multicast).

- (c) False. The OpenFlow specification itself does not provide mechanisms for Layer 2 learning across switches; this is typically handled by the controller logic that uses OpenFlow as a means to program the switches.

- (d) False. After a switch sends the first packet of a new flow to the controller, the controller usually installs a flow entry in the switch's flow table to handle subsequent packets of the same flow directly without involving the controller for each packet.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/software-defined-standards/specifications/', 'https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/openflow-spec-v1.1.0.pdf', 'https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/openflow-spec-v1.3.0.pdf']",1,6_control_plane,0.95,0.9992661202166916

b. dpctl can modify flow table entries on an OpenFlow switch.

",,"a,b,c,d,e","a,b,c,d,e",,"When choosing a controller for Software Defined Networking (SDN), several factors should be taken into account to ensure that it meets the requirements of the network it is intended to manage.

b. Pox's _handle_PacketIn function determines how a packet should be handled when it arrives at the controller.

a. POX does not automatically determine the order to install flow table rules. It is up to the SDN application developer to handle potential inconsistencies in forwarding behavior. 

b. The _handle_PacketIn function in POX is indeed responsible for determining how to handle packets that arrive at the controller. This function is typically overridden by developers to implement custom packet handling logic.

d. POX's performance is typically slower than NOX, which was one of the first SDN controllers and is written in C++. POX is written in Python, which is generally slower due to being an interpreted language rather than a compiled language like C++.

48,What is the difference between a hard timeout and an idle timeout?,"a. A hard timeout occurs exactly at the specified interval, whereas an idle timeout may occur slightly later than the specified interval.
b. A hard timeout expunges a flow table entry regardless of whether there have been active matches, whereas an idle timeout expunges the flow table entry only if there have been no matches for that flow within the specified interval.
c. A hard timeout expunges all flow table entry from the switch, whereas an idle timeout only expunges one flow at a time.
d. A hard timeout expunges a flow table entry for all switches in the network, whereas an idle timeout only expunges the flow table entry on the switches that have seen no matches for that flow within the specified interval.
",,b,b,,"In the context of Software Defined Networking (SDN), a hard timeout is used to remove a flow entry from a switch's flow table after a specified amount of time has passed, regardless of whether the flow entry has seen any packets or not. On the other hand, an idle timeout is used to remove a flow entry only if there have been no packets matching the flow entry for a specified amount of time. This means that if a flow is still active (i.e., packets are still being matched to the flow entry), the idle timeout will not trigger, and the flow entry will remain in the flow table until it becomes idle for the specified duration.","['Open Networking Foundation.

49,Which of the following are true about hubs and learning switches? Select all that apply,"a. A hub implemented in Pox requires all incoming packets to be directed to the controller.
b. A learning switch requires more logic at the controller (in terms of lines of code in Pox) than a hub.
c. A learning switch implemented in Pox can be easily extended to support firewall capabilities.
d. A learning switch implemented in Pox requires all incoming packets to be redirected to the controller.
e. A hub forwards an incoming packet on all ports (except the incoming port), whereas a switch only floods an incoming packet on all ports if it does not have a table entry that determines the output port for that packet.
",,"b,c,e","b,c,e",,"a. This is not necessarily true. A hub implemented in Pox or any other controller doesn't require all packets to be directed to the controller. A basic hub functionality can be achieved by simply forwarding all incoming packets to all ports except the incoming port, which doesn't require controller intervention for every packet once the initial rules are set up.
b. A learning switch does require more logic at the controller than a hub because it needs to maintain a table of MAC addresses and corresponding ports, and make forwarding decisions based on this table. This involves more lines of code than the simple functionality of a hub.
c. A learning switch can indeed be extended to support additional capabilities such as firewall functions because it already has the logic to manage and inspect packets and their headers, and make decisions based on that.
d. A learning switch implemented in Pox does not require all incoming packets to be redirected to the controller. It only needs to send packets to the controller when it does not know where to forward them (i.e., no matching entry in its MAC address table).
e. A hub does forward an incoming packet on all ports except the incoming port, which is known as 'flooding'. A switch, on the other hand, will only flood the packet if it doesn't have a table entry to determine the output port. Otherwise, it will forward the packet to the specific port associated with the destination MAC address.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch#Layer_2', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hub_(network_science)', 'https://www.opennetworking.org/software-defined-standards/overview/']",1,6_control_plane,0.95,0.9993328806261458

d. init

",,a,"a,b",,"In the context of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and more specifically within the OpenFlow protocol, the controller uses certain functions to manage the network.

c. redirect
d. drop
e. forward
",,"a,b","a,b",,"In OpenFlow, which is a protocol for software-defined networking (SDN), a flow table entry consists of two key components: match and action.
