28,A Layer 2 switch configuration places all its physical ports into VLAN 2. The IP addressing plan shows that address 175.28.1.150 (with mask 255.255.255.0) is reserved for use by this new LAN switch and that 175.28.1.254 is already configured on the router connected to that same VLAN. The switch needs to support SSH connections into the switch from any subnet in the network. Which of the following commands are part of the required configuration in this case? (Choose two answers.),"a. The switch cannot support SSH because all its ports connect to VLAN 2, and the IP address must be configured on interface VLAN 1.
b. The ip address 175.28.1.150 255.255.255.0 command in interface vlan 2 configuration mode.
c. The ip default-gateway 175.28.1.254 command in global configuration mode.
d. The ip address 172.16.2.250 255.255.255.0 command in interface vlan 1 configuration mode.
e. The ip default-gateway 175.28.1.150 command in global configuration mode.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"To configure a Layer 2 switch to support SSH connections, it needs an IP address and a default gateway set. The IP address must be configured on a VLAN interface that corresponds to the VLAN in which the switch's ports are assigned. Since all the switch's ports are in VLAN 2, the switch's VLAN 2 interface should be assigned the IP address. Therefore, the command 'ip address 175.28.1.150 255.255.255.0' is used in the VLAN 2 interface configuration mode. Additionally, the switch needs to know the default gateway for traffic to reach other subnets; the command 'ip default-gateway 175.28.1.254' sets the default gateway and is used in the global configuration mode. The other options are incorrect because they either specify the wrong VLAN interface, the wrong IP address, or the incorrect use of the ip default-gateway command.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-5.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3550/software/release/12_1_13_ea1/configuration/guide/scg/swipaddr.html']",1,chapter2_ethernet_lans,0.95,0.9999993295729247
