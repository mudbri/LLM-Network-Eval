92,"A LAN design uses a Layer 3 EtherChannel between two switches SW1 and SW2, with port-channel interface 1 used on both switches. SW1 uses ports G0/1 and G0/2 in the channel. However, only interface G0/1 is bundled into the channel and working. Think about the configuration settings on port G0/2 that could have existed before adding G0/2 to the EtherChannel. Which answers identify a setting that could prevent IOS from adding G0/2 to the Layer 3 EtherChannel? (Choose two answers.)","a. A different STP cost (spanning-tree cost value)
b. A different access VLAN (switchport access vlan vlanid)
c. A different speed (speed value)
d. A default setting for switchport (switchport)
",,"c,d","b,c",,"When configuring an EtherChannel, it is important that all the interfaces have the same settings to ensure they can form an EtherChannel properly. If the settings are mismatched, the EtherChannel will not form correctly. Specifically, a different access VLAN (switchport access vlan vlanid) would prevent an interface from being added to an EtherChannel because all interfaces in an EtherChannel must belong to the same VLAN if they are access ports. Similarly, a different speed (speed value) setting would prevent an interface from joining an EtherChannel because all interfaces in an EtherChannel must operate at the same speed. A different STP cost would not prevent an interface from joining an EtherChannel, as the STP cost can be calculated after the EtherChannel is formed. The default setting for switchport (switchport) would also not prevent an interface from joining an EtherChannel, as this can be configured after the EtherChannel is formed.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-6500-series-switches/12023-53.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750/software/release/12-2_55_se/configuration/guide/scg3750/swethchl.html']",0,chapter5_ipv4_routing,0.95,0.8535043460873835
