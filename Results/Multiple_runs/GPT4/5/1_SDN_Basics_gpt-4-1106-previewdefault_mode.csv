1,Which of the following are true about Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)? Select all that apply.,"a. The only sizes for an IP address allocation before CIDR were 8, 16, or 24 bits.
b. The prefix length for a CIDR prefix can be anywhere in the range from 0 to 32 bits.
c. In an Internet forwarding table with CIDR, there can only be one unique matching entry for any given IP address.
d. CIDR slowed the rate of Internet routing table growth because prefixes no longer had to be allocated in fixed-size blocks.
",,"b,d","b,c,d",,"CIDR, or Classless Inter-Domain Routing, was introduced to improve the allocation and routing of IP addresses. Here's why the selected choices are correct:

b. The prefix length for a CIDR prefix indeed can range from 0 to 32 bits for IPv4 addresses. This flexibility allows for more efficient use of IP address space.

 c. In an Internet forwarding table with CIDR, there should only be one unique matching entry for any given IP address to ensure proper routing. This is because CIDR allows for variable-length subnet masking, which helps in creating a hierarchical structure that ensures a single best path for routing.

 d. CIDR did slow the rate of Internet routing table growth. By allowing for allocations that are not bound to the classful boundaries of 8, 16, or 24 bits, networks could be divided into subnets of various sizes, which made IP address distribution more efficient and reduced the number of entries in the global routing table.

The statement a is not correct because before CIDR, IP address allocations were indeed based on classful network design, which used fixed-sized blocks, but these were not the only sizes. The classes included Class A (0-127, 8-bit prefix), Class B (128-191, 16-bit prefix), and Class C (192-223, 24-bit prefix), but there were also Class D for multicast and Class E for experimental purposes.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing', 'https://www.ripe.net/about-us/press-centre/understanding-ip-addressing']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9499866365879638
2,Which of the following are true about how DNS lookups work? Select all that apply.,"a. A DNS A-record query for google.com will only return a single IP address at a time.
b. An NS-record query for a DNS lookup will return the name(s) of the authoritative name server(s) for that domain.
c. If your local DNS resolver caches an NS record for google.com for multiple days, all clients who use that DNS resolver will continue using the same IP address to reach Google’s Web server until that NS record expires.
d. An MX-record query for a DNS lookup will return the IP address of the mail server for that domain.
e. All DNS PTR records are maintained by a single organization in-addr.arpa.
",,b,"b,d",,"Option (b) is correct because an NS-record (Name Server record) indeed points to the authoritative name server(s) for the domain, which is essential for delegating the responsibility of a sub-domain or a domain to another DNS server. Option (d) is correct as an MX-record (Mail Exchange record) specifies the mail server responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a domain and may include the priority of mail servers if multiple ones are available. However, it does not directly return the IP address but rather the domain name of the mail server; the IP address is subsequently obtained by resolving this domain name. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: Option (a) is incorrect because a DNS A-record query can return multiple IP addresses, not just a single one. This is a common practice for load balancing and fault tolerance. Option (c) is incorrect because an NS record does not directly influence the IP address used to reach a web server; it only points to the DNS servers that are authoritative for the domain. The A or AAAA records determine the actual IP addresses used. Option (e) is incorrect because although in-addr.arpa is used for reverse DNS lookups (PTR records), it is not maintained by a single organization; rather, it is managed by multiple organizations and network operators that maintain their respective portions of the in-addr.arpa namespace.","['https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1034.txt', 'https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_server', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MX_record', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_DNS_lookup']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9706633443217283
3,Which of the following are true about traffic control with BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
b. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
c. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
d. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
",,"a,b","a,b",,"a. The BGP local preference attribute is used to influence the outbound traffic policy. Higher local preference values are more preferred, and thus, a network operator can set the local preference to determine which route should be taken for traffic leaving the AS (Autonomous System).
b. BGP AS path prepending is a technique used to make a path look less attractive by artificially increasing its length, which is commonly used to influence inbound traffic. By appending its own AS number multiple times to the AS path, a network operator can make a route appear longer and therefore less preferred by other ASes making routing decisions for incoming traffic to the operator's AS.
c. AS path prepending does not directly control outbound traffic; it is primarily used to influence the decisions of other ASes for inbound traffic.
d. The BGP local preference attribute does not influence inbound traffic directly, as it is used within an AS to select the preferred path for outbound traffic.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/13759-37.html', 'https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/bgp/topics/topic-map/bgp-route-selection.html', 'https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/asn/asn-guide']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9864973844268312
4,Which of the following are true about layering? Select all that apply.,"a. The network layer guarantees reliable, in-order delivery of packets.
b. The network layer has only a single protocol in widespread use today, representing what we call the “narrow waist”.
c. The transport layer uses port numbers.
d. The destination address in the link layer header is always the address of the next layer-3 node along an end-to-end IP path.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"Layering in networking refers to the design of network software in layers, each providing a specific function. Option (a) is incorrect because the network layer does not guarantee reliable, in-order delivery of packets; that is a function of some transport layer protocols, like TCP. Option (b) is correct because the 'narrow waist' of the Internet protocol suite refers to the fact that the Internet has a single network layer protocol, IP, which is used universally. Option (c) is correct because the transport layer protocols, such as TCP and UDP, use port numbers to distinguish between different services or applications on a host. Option (d) is incorrect because the destination address in the link layer header is the address of the next node along the path, which could be the final destination or an intermediate node such as a router, not necessarily a layer-3 node.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_layer']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9994328758520769
5,Which of the following are not true about packet switching? Select all that apply.,"a. Once a connection is established between two endpoints in a packet switched network, the end-to-end route cannot change, or the connection must be re-established.
b. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will always experience predictable latency.
c. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will never be dropped by intermediate nodes along the path.
d. A user of a packet switched network might occasionally get a “busy signal” if there are too many users on the network.
",,"a,b,c,d","a,b,c",,"Packet switching is a digital networking communications method that groups all transmitted data into suitably sized blocks, called packets. In contrast to circuit switching where a dedicated path is established between two endpoints, packet switching allows for dynamic routing of packets, which means that the path can change during a session and doesn't require re-establishment of the connection for the route to change (a is incorrect). Traffic over a packet-switched network can experience variable latency due to the dynamic nature of the network, which can cause packets to take different paths, each with different transmission times (b is incorrect). Furthermore, packets can indeed be dropped if intermediate nodes are overloaded or if errors occur, which is why protocols like TCP include mechanisms for retransmission of lost packets (c is incorrect). The concept of a 'busy signal' is more associated with circuit-switched networks and is not applicable to packet-switched networks where the data can still be transmitted, albeit potentially with some delay or packet loss (d is not incorrect).","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching', 'https://www.techopedia.com/definition/25857/packet-switched-network-psn', 'https://www.lifewire.com/packet-switching-in-computer-networks-817481']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9944701799261213
6,Which of the following are true about content distribution networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Content distribution networks can improve the performance that a client sees by reducing the network latency between the client and the content that it is downloading.
b. Content distribution networks can reduce transit expenses for a content provider by enabling much of the provider’s content to be served from a nearby network, sometimes even from a cache that is within the client’s own network.
c. Real-time content such as video streams cannot be distributed from a content distribution network.
d. Content distribution networks typically redirect Web clients to a nearby Web cache by rewriting the IP address of packets sent from the client to the IP address of the nearby Web cache.
",,"a,b","a,b,d",,"Content distribution networks (CDNs) are designed to improve the delivery of content to clients across the internet. Option (a) is correct because CDNs distribute content across various locations closer to users, which reduces the distance data must travel, thereby reducing latency and improving performance. Option (b) is also correct as CDNs allow content providers to serve content from servers close to the user's location, which can reduce the provider's data transit costs and sometimes even serve content from a cache within the user's own network. Option (c) is incorrect because real-time content such as video streams can indeed be distributed through CDNs; technologies such as live streaming and adaptive bitrate streaming are often used in conjunction with CDNs for this purpose. Option (d) is correct because CDNs typically use DNS-based redirection methods to send clients to the nearest cache server, which can involve rewriting the IP address in the DNS response so that it points to the nearby Web cache.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/', 'https://aws.amazon.com/cdn/', 'https://www.akamai.com/our-thinking/cdn/what-is-a-cdn']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9999948894358089
7,Which of the following are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control? Select all that apply.,"a. Only wireless networks can have collisions at the receiver; such collisions are not possible on wired Ethernet networks.
b. Using RTS/CTS (“request to send”, “clear to send”) control reduces the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network.
c. A wireless sender can avoid causing a collision at the receiver by performing a “carrier sense” to determine whether any other sender wants to transmit at the time that it wishes to send a packet.
d. Disabling RTS/CTS necessarily lowers the effective throughput of the wireless network, since more collisions will occur at the receiver without RTS/CTS enabled.
",,b,"b,c",,"b. Using RTS/CTS control frames in 802.11 wireless networks helps in avoiding collisions by having a two-way handshake before the actual data transmission begins. However, this additional exchange of control frames can indeed reduce the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network because it adds overhead and takes up airtime that could be used for data transmission.

 c. A wireless sender can perform a carrier sense to check if the medium is busy before attempting to transmit. This is part of the CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) protocol used in 802.11 wireless networks. If the medium is determined to be busy, the sender will wait for a random backoff period before trying to transmit again, which helps in avoiding potential collisions at the receiver.

a. This statement is incorrect because collisions can occur on both wireless and wired Ethernet networks. In wired networks, CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) is used to detect collisions and take appropriate action.

 d. While RTS/CTS can help in reducing collisions, disabling it does not necessarily lower the effective throughput of the network. In some scenarios, especially in networks with low traffic or where devices are not close to each other, disabling RTS/CTS can actually improve throughput by reducing overhead.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-sense_multiple_access_with_collision_avoidance', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_sense_multiple_access_with_collision_detection', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9998400228740554
8,Which of the following are true about video streaming? Select all that apply.,"a. Using UDP to stream a video instead of TCP is appropriate if the client is more concerned about low delay and interactivity than it does about receiving a high-quality stream.
b. A larger playout buffer at the client allows the client more time to recover from lost packets.
c. Using TCP for video streaming could result in larger delays between transmission and playout than streaming the same video with UDP.
d. Since UDP provides no reliable delivery guarantees, a video streaming application that uses UDP as its transport cannot recover from any packet loss in the video stream.
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"a. UDP is often used for streaming media where timely delivery is more important than reliable delivery. This is because UDP does not have the overhead of ensuring packet order and retransmission that TCP does, which can introduce latency and thus is suitable for scenarios where low delay is preferred over stream quality.
b. A larger playout buffer at the client side can indeed help to compensate for packet loss and network jitter by providing more time to recover missing packets before they are needed for playback.
c. TCP includes congestion control and flow control mechanisms, which can introduce additional delays in video streaming as the protocol ensures reliable and ordered delivery of packets. This can result in larger delays compared to UDP, which lacks these features and can send packets more quickly without waiting for acknowledgments or retransmissions.
d. This statement is incorrect. Even though UDP itself does not provide reliability, applications can implement their own mechanisms on top of UDP to recover from packet loss, such as error correction codes or retransmission strategies.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_Transport_Protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol', 'Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach (7th Edition) by James Kurose and Keith Ross']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9999808235742201
9,Which of the following are true about TCP? Select all that apply.,"a. TCP guarantees that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted.
b. A TCP sender and receiver use a “three-way handshake” both to set up and to terminate the TCP connection.
c. TCP’s congestion avoidance algorithm causes the sender to reduce its sending rate by a factor of two when it sees a packet loss.
d. A TCP sender controls its sending rate by adjusting the number of unacknowledged packets that can be sent over the network at any time.
",,"a,c,d","a,b,c,d",,"TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable data transmission between sender and receiver. Here's why each statement is true: a. TCP guarantees in-order delivery of bytes. It uses sequence numbers to ensure that data is received in the same order it was sent. b. The 'three-way handshake' is a process used by TCP to establish a connection (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) and to terminate a connection (FIN, ACK, FIN-ACK). c. TCP's congestion avoidance algorithm, such as TCP Tahoe and TCP Reno, includes a mechanism where the sender's congestion window is reduced, typically by half, when packet loss is detected, which is often interpreted as a signal of network congestion. d. TCP uses a congestion window and a flow control window to control the sending rate. The number of unacknowledged packets (controlled by the congestion window) is indeed a key part of how TCP manages the sending rate to avoid overwhelming the network.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol', 'https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc793.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9990426995920266
10,Which of the following are true about denial of service attacks (and defenses)? Select all that apply.,"a. If every network on the Internet performed stateless ingress filtering to defend against source IP spoofing, the DNS reflection attack would not work.
b. If every network on the Internet performed stateless egress filtering to defend against source IP address spoofing, the DNS reflection attack could not be carried out.
c. In a “SYN Flood” attack, each TCP SYN packet that a victim receives causes it to set up TCP connection state.
d. A “DNS Reflection” attack requires the attacking client to “spoof” the source IP address of the packet containing the DNS request.
",,"b,c,d","a,c,d",,"a. True. Stateless ingress filtering is a technique used to ensure that incoming packets have a source IP address that matches the network prefix of the interface they are coming in on. If every network on the Internet performed stateless ingress filtering, it would be much harder for attackers to use IP address spoofing to make their traffic appear to come from a legitimate source, which is a critical component of the DNS reflection attack.

b. False. While egress filtering (filtering outgoing traffic) is useful for preventing a network's own devices from participating in an attack, it does not directly prevent an attacker from spoofing the source IP address from a different network. Egress filtering is not sufficient by itself to prevent DNS reflection attacks, as the attacker can operate from a network that does not perform egress filtering.

c. True. In a SYN Flood attack, the attacker sends a succession of SYN requests to a target's system in an attempt to consume enough server resources to make the system unresponsive to legitimate traffic. Each SYN packet received by the victim causes it to allocate resources and create TCP connection state in anticipation of completing the three-way handshake.

d. True. A DNS Reflection attack involves an attacker sending a DNS query with a spoofed source IP address (the victim's IP). The DNS servers that receive the query will send the response to the victim's IP address, thereby overwhelming the victim with the combined response traffic from multiple DNS servers.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/dns-best-practices.html', 'https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-015', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Reflection_and_amplification']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9843652200350328
