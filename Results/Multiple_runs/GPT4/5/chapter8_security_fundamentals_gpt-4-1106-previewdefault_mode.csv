137,"In a spoofing attack, which of the following parameters are commonly spoofed? (Choose two answers)","a. Source IP address
b. MAC address
c. ARP address
d. Routing table
e. Destination IP address
f. ARP table
",,"a,b","a,b",,"In a spoofing attack, attackers commonly fake or 'spoof' the source IP address to make it appear as though packets are coming from a trusted source, thereby bypassing IP-based security measures. Additionally, the MAC address can also be spoofed, which is often used in attacks on local area networks to impersonate another host's MAC address. While ARP spoofing is a type of attack, 'ARP address' is not a correct term; ARP is a protocol used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses. Spoofing the ARP table (f) is a result of an ARP spoofing attack, not a parameter that is spoofed. The routing table (d) and destination IP address (e) are not typically the targets of spoofing; rather, they can be manipulated or affected by other types of attacks.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ip-spoofing.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_spoofing', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing']",1,chapter8_security_fundamentals,0.95,0.7939219578208847
