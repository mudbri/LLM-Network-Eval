c. Both routers’ OSPF process uses router ID 42.42.42.42
d. Both routers’ interfaces use an OSPF Dead interval of 80
",,c,c,,"For OSPF routers to become neighbors, there are several requirements that must be met. They must be in the same subnet, have matching Hello and Dead intervals, and have compatible OSPF parameters. The router ID in OSPF is used to uniquely identify a router within an OSPF domain. If two routers are configured with the same router ID, they will not form an OSPF adjacency because OSPF assumes that they are the same router. Hence, option (c) is correct because having the same router ID on both routers would prevent them from becoming OSPF neighbors. Options (a) and (b) would not prevent OSPF adjacency. OSPF router IDs being the same is a common cause of OSPF neighbor establishment issues.
