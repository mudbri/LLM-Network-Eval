1,Which of the following terms describe Ethernet addresses that can send one frame and is delivered to multiple devices on the LAN? (Choose two answers.),"a. Broadcast address
b. Multicast address
c. IP address
d. MAC address
e. Unicast address
",,"a,b","a,b",,"In Ethernet networking, a broadcast address is used to send a frame to all devices within a broadcast domain. This means that all devices on the local area network (LAN) will receive the frame. A multicast address, on the other hand, is used to send a single frame to a group of devices on the LAN that have been configured to listen for frames sent to that specific multicast address. IP addresses are used at the network layer for routing packets across different networks and are not specifically tied to the concept of broadcast or multicast at the data link layer. MAC addresses are physical hardware addresses assigned to network interfaces, and while there are multicast MAC addresses that correspond to IP multicast addresses, the term 'MAC address' by itself does not imply broadcasting or multicasting. Unicast addresses are used to send a frame to a single device on the network.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_address', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_address', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicast']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,1,0.9999993743675457
3,___________ is a set of rules determining how network devices respond when two devices attempt to use a data channel simultaneously and encounter a data collision.,"a. CSMA/CD
b. CSMA/CA
c. TCP/IP
d. TCP/UDP
",,a,a,,"CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection) is the set of rules used in networks, particularly in early Ethernet technology, to determine how devices respond when they try to send data at the same time and a collision occurs. When a collision is detected, CSMA/CD dictates that the devices stop transmitting, wait for a random period of time, and then attempt to retransmit the data. This is in contrast to CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance), which is used in wireless networks to prevent collisions before they happen. TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. TCP/UDP (Transmission Control Protocol/User Datagram Protocol) are protocols used within the TCP/IP suite for sending bits of data — known as packets — over the network. They do not deal with collision detection or avoidance.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-sense_multiple_access_with_collision_detection', 'https://www.techopedia.com/definition/2573/carrier-sense-multiple-access-with-collision-detection-csmacd']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,0.99,0.9999996871837189
