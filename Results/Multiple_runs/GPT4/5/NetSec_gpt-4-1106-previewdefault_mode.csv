e. dynamic NAT
",,d,d,,"Policy NAT (also known as Policy-based NAT) allows the implementation of NAT rules based on certain criteria such as the source or destination address, or even based on specific types of traffic.

e. ACK or RST
",,e,b,,"The established keyword in an Access Control List (ACL) is used to permit incoming packets that are part of an already established session.

d. In a TCP reset attack, the RST bit in the TCP packet header must be set to 1; settings for other fields in the TCP header are irrelevant.
",,b,b,,"A TCP reset attack is designed to terminate an existing TCP connection between two hosts. By sending a spoofed TCP packet with the RST (reset) bit set to 1, the attacker can cause the receiving host to abort the connection, thus disrupting ongoing communications. While the TCP 3-way handshake can be disrupted by various means, a TCP reset attack specifically targets established connections rather than the handshake process itself. It is also important to note that the RST bit being set to 1 does not always indicate a malicious attack; it can be a legitimate part of normal TCP operations when a host wishes to terminate a connection. Lastly, while the RST bit is crucial in a reset attack, other fields in the TCP header, such as sequence numbers, are also relevant because they must often match or be within expected ranges for the reset to be considered valid by the receiving host.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_reset_attack', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5961']",1,NetSec,0.95,0.9999962302846054

c. Direct SYN flood attack
d. Ping of death
",,b,b,,"Attackers use malware that is controlled through Command and Control (CnC) servers to launch attacks on a target without the attack coming directly from the attacker's location. This allows the attacker to control the malware remotely, often through a network of compromised computers known as a botnet, to execute the attack and avoid detection.","['https://www.imperva.com/learn/ddos/botnet-ddos/', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/command-control.html']",1,NetSec,0.95,0.9999995679800934
32,Which TCP/IP application protocol can be used in an amplification attack by exploiting the protocol weakness in recursive lookup? Select one choice.,"a. HTTPS
b. LDAP
c. HTTP
d. DNS
e. SMTP
",,d,d,,"DNS (Domain Name System) is known to be exploitable in amplification attacks due to its recursive lookup feature. Attackers can use DNS servers to amplify the volume of data sent to a target server, overwhelming it with traffic. This is done by making small query requests that result in much larger responses being sent to the spoofed IP address of the victim. This is not a characteristic of HTTPS, HTTP, LDAP, or SMTP, which typically do not involve recursive lookups or the potential for large response sizes relative to the request size.","['https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-088A', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Amplification']",1,NetSec,0.95,0.9998402164567504
33,Which type of attack forces a machine to respond to a SYN message by sending a packet to itself on the same port it received the SYN? Select one choice.,"a. Smurf
b. Land attack
c. Amplification attack
d. Reflection attack
",,b,b,,"A Land attack is a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack that sends a special crafted packet to a machine with the SYN flag set, where the source and destination IP addresses are the same as the target machine, and the source and destination ports are the same, causing the machine to reply to itself continuously. This can result in the machine being overwhelmed and can lead to a denial of service. The other attacks listed are different types of network attacks: Smurf attacks involve sending a large number of ICMP packets with the victim's spoofed IP to network broadcast addresses; Amplification attacks involve an attacker sending a small amount of data to a third party, with the response being directed at the victim in an amplified manner; Reflection attacks involve sending requests to a third party with the source IP address set to the victim's address, resulting in the third party's response being sent to the victim.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAND', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/smurf-ddos-attack/', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/amplification-ddos-attack/', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/reflection-ddos-attack/']",1,NetSec,0.95,1.0
34,A Layer 2 redirect or spoofing attack can be referred to as what type of attack? Select one choice.,"a. ARP attack
b. DHCP attack
c. NetBios attack
d. SSID attack
",,a,a,,"A Layer 2 redirect or spoofing attack that targets the resolution of IP addresses to MAC addresses is known as an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) attack. ARP spoofing involves sending fake ARP messages over a local area network (LAN), which results in the linking of an attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network.

35,Which one of the following options is the illegitimate DHCP server that is referred to in the context of a DHCP server-based attack? Select one choice.,"a. A sitting duck server
b. A rogue DHCP server
c. A target server
d. An erroneous server
",,b,b,,"In the context of DHCP server-based attacks, a 'rogue DHCP server' refers to an unauthorized DHCP server on the network. Such servers can be set up by an attacker to issue incorrect IP addresses and other network settings to clients, which can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks or other security breaches.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/identity-services-engine/200292-Prevent-Rogue-DHCP-Servers-on-Your-Networ.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol#Security']",1,NetSec,1,1.0
36,What is one way of mitigating DHCP attacks by using a Cisco switch? Select one choice.,"a. VLAN segmentation
b. MAC address security
c. DHCP snooping
d. DHCP authentication""
",,c,c,,"DHCP snooping is a security feature on switches that acts as a firewall between untrusted hosts and trusted DHCP servers. It does so by filtering out untrusted DHCP messages and by building and maintaining a DHCP snooping binding table. This table contains the MAC address to IP address binding as provided by DHCP responses, ensuring that only clients with valid bindings can obtain an IP address. This is a specific feature designed to mitigate DHCP spoofing and other DHCP-related attacks.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12-2SX/configuration/guide/book/snoodhcp.html', 'https://www.networkstraining.com/dhcp-snooping/']",1,NetSec,1,0.9999996871837189
