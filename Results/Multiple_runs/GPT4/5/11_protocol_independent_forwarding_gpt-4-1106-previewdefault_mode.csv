b. Processing packets at higher rates.
c. A wider range of packet processing primitives.
d. Flexible match-action tables, such as the ability to compose multiple match-action tables in sequence or in parallel.
e. A configurable packet parser that is not tied to a specific header format.
",,"c,d,e","a,b,c,d,e",,"The desired features in future SDN switches that motivate a programmable data plane include a variety of aspects aimed at improving performance, flexibility, and efficiency. Here's how each option contributes to this motivation: 

a. Reducing energy consumption for custom packet processing: Programmable data planes can optimize the processing of packets to be more energy-efficient than traditional fixed-function switches. 

b. Processing packets at higher rates: The ability to handle packets at higher speeds is crucial for meeting the demands of growing network traffic and reducing latency. 

c. A wider range of packet processing primitives: This allows for more complex and varied network functions to be implemented directly in the data plane. 

d. Flexible match-action tables: The flexibility to compose match-action tables in sequence or parallel gives greater control over how packets are processed and allows for more sophisticated traffic management. 

e. A configurable packet parser: A parser that is not tied to a specific header format can adapt to new and custom protocols, making the switch more versatile. 

All these features contribute to the goal of having a more efficient, flexible, and high-performance network infrastructure, which is at the core of SDN's value proposition.","['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140366416302700', 'https://www.networkworld.com/article/2287045/what-is-software-defined-networking-sdn-.html', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6636745']",0,11_protocol_independent_forwarding,0.95,0.9130395905679316

b. The ability to evolve an existing control protocol without breaking interoperability.
c. The ability to run a switch independently from the controller.
d. The ability to support multiple protocols running in parallel on the same hardware.
e. The ability to run a network with both legacy OpenFlow switches and switches that support custom packet processing.
",,a,"a,d",,"Protocol independence refers to the capability of network devices or systems to operate without being tied to a specific communication protocol. Option (a) describes a scenario where the packet parser can understand and process different types of protocols without being limited to a specific one, which aligns with the concept of protocol independence. Option (d) suggests that the hardware can handle multiple protocols at the same time, which is also indicative of protocol independence. Options (b), (c), and (e) do not directly describe protocol independence but rather aspects of protocol evolution, switch autonomy, and network interoperability with legacy systems, respectively.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking', 'https://www.opennetworking.org/software-defined-standards/overview/']",0,11_protocol_independent_forwarding,0.9,0.7523106063130935
81,Which of the following describe functions of the P4 parser? Select all that apply.,"a. Constructing a graph of dependencies between different logical tables.
b. Translating rules to physical tables.
c. Verifying that the description of packet parsing is consistent with the behavior of an existing hardware switch (e.g., a legacy OpenFlow switch).
d. Translating a packet processing specification to a state machine.
e. Mapping logical tables to underlying switch resources.
",,"c,d","a,d",,"The P4 parser is a component of the P4 programming language, which is used to describe how packets are processed by the data plane of a network switch or router. The parser's role is to interpret the packet headers and extract relevant information to be used by the rest of the P4 program. Specifically, the parser does the following:

- Constructing a graph of dependencies between different logical tables (a). This involves determining the order in which headers are parsed and how they relate to each other.
- Translating a packet processing specification to a state machine (d). The parser effectively acts as a state machine, moving from one state to another based on the contents of the packet's header fields.

Options b and e are more related to the role of a compiler or control plane, which would map the high-level P4 program to the specific capabilities of the physical hardware, including translating rules to physical tables and mapping logical tables to underlying switch resources. Option c is not a primary function of the P4 parser; it is more related to the validation and testing of P4 programs against specific hardware implementations.","['https://p4.org/p4-spec/docs/P4-16-v1.0.0-spec.html', 'https://p4.org']",0,11_protocol_independent_forwarding,0.95,0.8835157425397295
82,"Which of the following best describe the relationship between a language like P4, an assembler like NetASM, and target programmable hardware (e.g., RMT)?","a. P4 is much more amenable to ""cost semantics"" (i.e., figuring out how much a particular operation would cost in terms of power or area) than NetASM.
NetASM and P4 are two examples of high-level programming languages; they are interchangeable.
b. P4 has verifiable semantics, whereas NetASM does not.
c. A language like P4 would ""compile"" to an assembly language like NetASM, which would then specify a one-to-one relationship with resources on the target forwarding hardware.
d. A language like NetASM would ""compile"" to an assembly language like P4, which would then specify a one-to-one relationship with resources on the target forwarding hardware.
",,c,c,,"P4 is a high-level language designed for programming protocol-independent packet processors. NetASM is a low-level assembly-like language that provides a one-to-one mapping to the resources on the target hardware. The relationship between a high-level language like P4 and an assembler like NetASM is that P4 code would compile down to an intermediate representation, such as NetASM, which then directly corresponds to the resources and operations on the programmable hardware, such as the Reconfigurable Match Tables (RMT) architecture. This process is analogous to how high-level programming languages in general are compiled down to assembly language, which then gets translated into machine code that runs on a processor. Therefore, option c correctly describes this relationship.","['https://p4.org/p4-spec/docs/P4-16-v1.0.0-spec.html', 'https://www.opennetworking.org/images/stories/downloads/sdn-resources/onf-specifications/openflow/OpenFlow%20Table%20Type%20Patterns%20v1.0.pdf', 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.0001.pdf']",1,11_protocol_independent_forwarding,0.95,0.9996606616882732

84,Which of the following are true about locally contained applications? Select all that apply.,"a. Locally contained applications can be implemented with regular OpenFlow instructions.
b. A MAC learning switch can be implemented as a locally contained application.
c. Locally contained applications forward packets more slowly than their stateless counterparts.
d. A locally contained application can implement SDN logic without ever requiring a packet to be sent to the controller.
e. Locally contained applications allow the hardware pipeline to make switch-local state modifications.
",,"b,d,e","a,b,d,e",,"Locally contained applications are those that can operate solely within the switch's processing capabilities without requiring intervention from the SDN controller for every packet or flow. They can indeed be implemented with regular OpenFlow instructions (a), which is the de facto standard for communicating with the SDN data plane. A MAC learning switch, which learns the source MAC addresses of packets and the ports on which they arrive to make forwarding decisions, can be implemented as a locally contained application (b). Such applications can implement SDN logic and make decisions at the switch level without sending packets to the controller for every new flow (d). This is one of the key advantages of SDN, enabling faster packet processing by reducing the load on the controller. Additionally, locally contained applications can allow the hardware pipeline to make switch-local state modifications (e), such as updating flow tables based on observed traffic, without requiring controller intervention. The statement that locally contained applications forward packets more slowly than their stateless counterparts (c) is incorrect; in fact, by avoiding the need to communicate with the controller, they can often forward packets more quickly.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/software-defined-standards/specifications/', 'https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sdn/current/msg00018.html', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/locally-contained-application']",0,11_protocol_independent_forwarding,0.95,0.9917963294248681
