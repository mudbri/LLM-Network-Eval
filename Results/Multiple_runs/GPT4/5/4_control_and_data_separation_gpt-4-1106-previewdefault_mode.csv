23,Which of the following are examples of control plane operations? Select all that apply.,"a. Rate-limiting traffic so that the overall sending rate does not exceed a certain throughput.
b. Determining that a user's MAC address is authentic before allowing it to send traffic on the network.
c. Load balancing traffic across two output ports based on the hash of each packet's source IP address.
d. Determining the forwarding path that satisfies an access control policy.
e. Computing a shortest path routing tree.
",,"b,d,e","b,d,e",,"Control plane operations involve making decisions about how traffic should be handled in the network. These decisions include the policies and rules that govern traffic management, such as authentication, access control, and routing decisions. Specifically:

- Option (b) 'Determining that a user's MAC address is authentic before allowing it to send traffic on the network' is a control plane operation because it involves authenticating a device before it can participate in the network, which is a network policy decision.

- Option (d) 'Determining the forwarding path that satisfies an access control policy' is a control plane operation because it involves making a decision on the path traffic should take based on security policies, which is part of network control and management.

- Option (e) 'Computing a shortest path routing tree' is a control plane operation because it involves calculating the routes that packets should take through the network, which is a fundamental routing decision.

Options (a) and (c) are more aligned with data plane operations. The data plane is responsible for the actual handling of packets in the network, including rate-limiting (a) and load balancing (c), which are actions taken on packets as they pass through the network devices.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_plane', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/whats-the-difference-between-the-control-plane-and-data-plane/', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/what-is-sdn.html']",1,4_control_and_data_separation,0.95,0.9941085168106744
25,What could be the operational steps behind the AT&T's IRSCP (a commercial version of the Routing Control Platform) for detecting malicious traffic? Select all that apply.,"a. The controller sees all traffic passing through the network, detects an attack, and installs a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where the attack traffic is originating.
b. The end host changes its IP address so that it is no longer the target of the attack traffic.
c. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to re-route traffic through a deep-packet inspection device.
d. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to install a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where attack traffic is originating.
e. A victim end host sends an alert to an on-path firewall about the source and nature of an attack, at which point the firewall installs a null route to drop the traffic at the entry point where the attack is originating.
",,"c,d","a,c,d",,"AT&T's IRSCP (Integrated Routing and Service Control Point) is designed to enhance network control and security. Given the options and the context of software-defined networking (SDN) and network security, the steps involved in detecting and mitigating malicious traffic would likely include the following: 

- The controller (which has a network-wide view) detecting an attack and installing a null route to prevent the attack traffic from reaching its destination (option a). 

- A measurement system (which could be part of the SDN infrastructure) detecting an attack, determining where it is coming from, and then instructing the controller to take action such as re-routing traffic or dropping it (options c and d). 

Option b is less likely because changing the IP address of the end host is not a typical response for a network controller to mitigate an attack, as it would disrupt legitimate traffic and services. Option e is also less likely because it describes a scenario where the end host communicates directly with a firewall, which is not the centralized approach of SDN where the controller has an overarching role in network decisions.","['https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5611236/', 'https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi16/technical-sessions/presentation/katta', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-the-definition-of-software-defined-networking-sdn/']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.9,0.9411726040755138

b. Customer-controlled egress selection.
c. Improved logging capabilities.
d. Planned maintenance of an edge router.
e. Forecasting of network capacity.
",,"a,b,d","a,b,d,e",,"Software Defined Networking (SDN) simplifies network management by separating the control plane (which makes decisions about where traffic should go) from the data plane (which actually forwards the traffic to the selected destination). This separation allows for more flexible and centralized management of network resources. Here's how the options relate to SDN benefits: a. Improved interdomain routing security - SDN can enhance security by allowing more centralized and programmable traffic management, which can help in securing interdomain routing. b. Customer-controlled egress selection - With SDN, customers can have more control over their traffic flows, including the selection of egress points. d. Planned maintenance of an edge router - SDN enables network administrators to reroute traffic around routers undergoing maintenance without impacting network performance. e. Forecasting of network capacity - The centralized control of SDN can provide a global view of the network, making it easier to analyze and forecast capacity requirements. Improved logging capabilities (option c) can also benefit from SDN, but this is not inherently tied to the separation of control and data planes, as improved logging can be achieved through other means as well.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/software-defined-networking/what-is-sdn.html', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-the-definition-of-software-defined-networking-sdn/']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.85,0.5773171606029642
27,What are some of the motivations for using Layer-2 forwarding in a data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Ability to use existing routing protocols to establish paths between hosts.
b. Easier configuration/administration, since there is no need to number hosts or configure subnets.
c. Better security properties.
d. Better scaling properties.
e. Better load balancing properties.
",,b,"b,d,e",,"Layer-2 forwarding in a data center is often motivated by several factors: b) Easier configuration/administration is a key motivation because Layer-2 networks do not require the configuration of IP addresses and subnets for the devices connected to the network, which simplifies the setup process. d) Better scaling properties are also a consideration since Layer-2 forwarding can handle a large number of hosts within the same broadcast domain, and the flat addressing scheme can simplify network expansion. e) Better load balancing properties can be achieved at Layer-2 with technologies like EtherChannel and MLAG (Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation), which allow for the aggregation of multiple physical links into a single logical link for higher throughput and redundancy. Option a) is not correct because Layer-2 forwarding uses MAC addresses, not IP routing protocols, to establish paths between hosts. Option c) is not correct because Layer-2 networks can be less secure due to the potential for broadcast storms and the lack of segmentation, which can be mitigated with Layer-3 routing.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Data_Center/nx_1000V_dc/2DC1/N1KV_L2_L3.pdf', 'https://www.networkcomputing.com/data-centers/pros-and-cons-layer-2-vs-layer-3-networking']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.95,0.6985040216035273
28,How does the separation of the control and data plane make networking in data centers easier?,"a. Virtual machines can be migrated within the network without renumbering entire portions of the network or re-assigning network services to different IP addresses.
b. The control plane allows traffic to be forwarded using Layer 2 addresses, thus allowing automatic load balance across the topology.
c. The separation allows fewer switches to be used in the data center topology, thus lowering costs.
d. All routes can be controlled and monitored from a central point of control.
e. A network controller can permit the renumbering of end hosts to have topology-dependent Layer 2 MAC addresses.
",,"a,d,e","a,d",,"The separation of the control and data planes in Software Defined Networking (SDN) allows for centralized management and greater flexibility in network operations. Virtual machines can indeed be migrated without the need to renumber or re-assign network services, as the control plane can dynamically update the network configuration to reflect changes in VM locations (option a). Moreover, having a centralized control plane allows all routes to be controlled and monitored from a single point, simplifying network management and enabling more efficient use of resources (option d). Option b is incorrect because while SDN can aid in load balancing, the control plane does not inherently allow traffic to be forwarded using Layer 2 addresses for this purpose. Option c is misleading because the separation of planes does not directly affect the number of physical switches needed. Option e is incorrect because the renumbering of end hosts to have topology-dependent MAC addresses is not a typical feature or advantage of SDN.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/software-defined-access/index.html', 'https://www.ietf.org/blog/software-defined-networking/']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.95,0.9999985399426659

b. Inability to respond to link failures.
c. Incorrect security policies.
d. Incorrect operation when one controller fails.
e. Forwarding loops.
",,"c,e","b,c,d,e",,"Consistency problems in the control plane with multiple controller replicas can lead to various issues. Inability to respond to link failures (b) can occur if different controllers have conflicting or outdated views of the network topology. Incorrect security policies (c) might be enforced if controllers are not synchronized, leading to potential security breaches or unintended access. Incorrect operation when one controller fails (d) can result from the failure of other controllers to take over its functions seamlessly. Forwarding loops (e) can be caused by inconsistencies in the network state information among controllers, leading to incorrect routing decisions. A flood of traffic at the controller (a) is not typically a direct result of consistency problems but rather a potential symptom of a denial-of-service attack or misconfiguration.","['https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/whats-sdn-controller/', 'https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283506123_Software-Defined_Networking_A_Comprehensive_Survey']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.95,0.7207394508469448
30,What are some approaches to coping with inconsistency across controller replicas? Select all that apply.,"a. Running a consistency protocol across controller replicas.
b. Keeping a ""hot spare"" replica that has a complete view of the network state.
c. Only keeping a subset of the network state in memory at any time.
d. Using different controllers for independent parts of the network.
e. Having multiple controllers install forwarding table entries on the same router and resolving the conflict on the router itself.
",,"a,b,c,d","a,b,d",,"In the context of Software Defined Networking (SDN), consistency across controller replicas is crucial for maintaining a coherent network state and ensuring reliable network operations. Here are the reasons for selecting the given options:

a. Running a consistency protocol across controller replicas is a standard approach to ensure that all replicas have the same view of the network state. This can involve distributed consensus algorithms like Raft or Paxos.

b. Keeping a 'hot spare' replica means that there is a fully synchronized backup controller that can take over immediately if the primary controller fails. This helps in maintaining consistency because the 'hot spare' has an up-to-date copy of the network state.

d. Using different controllers for independent parts of the network can help in reducing the complexity of maintaining consistency because each controller is responsible for a separate portion of the network. This reduces the chances of conflicts and inconsistencies.

Option c is not typically an approach to handling inconsistency; rather, it could potentially cause inconsistency if not managed correctly. Option e is not a standard practice because it could lead to unpredictable behavior on the router due to conflicting entries and is not a scalable solution for resolving inconsistencies across controllers.","['https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-the-definition-of-software-defined-networking-sdn/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.95,0.83147837423772

e. Running multiple controllers, and having each controller only manage a part of the network.
",,"a,b,c,e","a,c,e",,"In Software Defined Networking (SDN), the control plane is separated from the data plane to provide centralized management and programmability. However, this separation can introduce scalability challenges. To cope with these challenges, several approaches can be implemented: 

a. Caching forwarding decisions in the data plane can help minimize the interaction with the controller for each packet, thus reducing the load on the controller and improving the performance of the network. 

b. Limiting control-plane operations to a subset of network operations is not a common approach for scalability; instead, the control plane typically needs to handle a wide range of operations to manage the network effectively. 

c. Eliminating redundant data structures can help in optimizing memory usage and improving processing speed, which contributes to better scalability. 

d. Sending all traffic through the controller would actually worsen scalability issues because it would create a bottleneck at the controller, potentially leading to significant performance degradation. 

e. Running multiple controllers with each managing a part of the network (also known as controller distribution or partitioning) can help in scaling the network by distributing the load among multiple controllers and avoiding a single point of failure or bottleneck.","['https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/software-defined-networking', 'https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-sdnrg-layer-terminology-00.txt', 'https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260213764_Software_Defined_Networking_A_Survey']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.95,0.8631909304209678
32,"Which property guarantees that each RCP replica continues to install correct forwarding state in the network data plane, even in the case of a partition in the data plane?","a. Each controller has a complete view of the portion of the network that it is controlling, and therefore can guarantee consistent routing within that partition.
b. The controller cannot see many of the routers in the network anyway, so there is no way for it to install incorrect routing state in the routers that it is not connected to.
c. The controllers are partitioned from the network routers, and the routers will fall back to running a distributed routing protocol.
d. Running the network from a single high-level control plane guarantees that network partitions and loops never occur in the first place.
",,a,a,,"The property described in the question is related to the ability of a Software Defined Networking (SDN) controller to maintain a consistent view of the network, or at least the portion it controls, despite network partitions. Option 'a' is correct because if each controller maintains a complete and accurate view of its domain, it can ensure that the forwarding state it installs is correct for that partition. This does not prevent partitions but ensures that routing remains consistent within each partition. The other options either misunderstand the nature of SDN (b, d) or describe a fallback to traditional distributed routing (c), which does not guarantee the correct installation of forwarding state by the controller itself.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-resources/sdn-definition/', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6602305']",1,4_control_and_data_separation,0.95,0.996395039229802
