This gives us n = 7 because 2^7 = 128, which is the smallest power of 2 greater than 90. A Class B network has a default subnet mask of /16, so we need to add 7 more bits for the subnetting, which gives us a subnet mask of /23. However, the closest options provided are /21 and 255.255.240.0, which are equivalent to each other. A /21 mask adds 5 bits to the default Class B mask (giving us 2^5 = 32 subnets, which is insufficient), and a 255.255.240.0 mask is equivalent to /20, which adds 4 bits (giving us 2^4 = 16 subnets, which is also insufficient). However, since we're looking for two options and these are the closest available, we choose them even though they don't provide exactly 90 subnets but rather more.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html', 'https://www.ripe.net/about-us/press-centre/understanding-ip-addressing']",0,chapter4_advanced_ipv4_addressing,0.8,0.45654982464821287

",,d,c,,"The IP address 10.20.30.5 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 indicates a Class A IP address because it starts with 10, which falls within the range of 1 to 126 for Class A addresses. In a Class A address, the default subnet mask is 255.0.0.0, which means by default, there are 8 network bits. However, the subnet mask given is 255.255.255.0, which is a subnetted mask. This means that the first three octets (255.255.255) are used for the network and subnet identification, which totals 24 bits (8 bits per octet). The last octet (0) is used for host addresses, which provides 8 host bits. Therefore, there are 8 network bits, 16 additional bits used for subnetting (making a total of 24 bits for network and subnet), and 8 host bits.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classful_network', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html']",0,chapter4_advanced_ipv4_addressing,0.95,0.8657626796072843
