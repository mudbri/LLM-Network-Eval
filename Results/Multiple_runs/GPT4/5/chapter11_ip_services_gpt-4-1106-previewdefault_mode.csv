You are responsible to find out why users are not being able to reach the Internet.","a. The cause is not related to dynamic NAT
b. The command output does not provide any clue to identify the problem
c. Dynamic NAT can't use Standard ACLs
d. The NAT pool does not have enough entries to fulfill the user's requests
",,d,d,,"The output indicates that the NAT pool 'examsdigest' has a total of 10 addresses available for NAT translation (from 190.1.1.1 to 190.1.1.10) and all of them are allocated (100%). Additionally, there are 595 'misses', which suggests that there have been 595 instances where an inside device tried to access an outside network but could not be allocated an address from the NAT pool because the pool was already fully utilized. This indicates that the NAT pool does not have enough addresses to accommodate all the requests from the users trying to access the Internet.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/network-address-translation-nat/13772-12.html', 'https://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2180210']",1,chapter11_ip_services,0.95,0.9999815683978641

d. 5
",,c,c,,"In Cisco IOS, log messages are categorized into different severity levels, ranging from 0 (emergencies) to 7 (debugging). A severity level of 4 means 'Warning - Warning condition'.

d. CDP
",,a,a,,"NTP (Network Time Protocol) is used to synchronize the clocks of computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is used for sending emails.

Host A and host B attach to the same LAN and have correct default router settings per the FHRP configuration. Which of the following statements is true for this LAN?","a. You can't connect two routers to the same LAN subnet.
b. If one router fails, hosts can't send packets off-subnet

They ensure that if one router fails, another can take over as the default gateway without any noticeable change to the hosts on the network. Given that the routers are configured with an FHRP and the hosts have the correct default router settings according to the FHRP configuration, if one router were to fail, both Host A and Host B would indeed use the remaining router as their default router.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/hot-standby-router-protocol-hsrp/13780-6.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12-2SX/configuration/guide/book/vrrp.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750/software/release/12-2_55_se/configuration/guide/scg3750/swglbp.html']",1,chapter11_ip_services,0.95,0.9999977799274644
