b. Division
c. Subtraction
d. Addition
",,c,c,,"During a traceroute operation, each router along the path to the destination decrements the Time To Live (TTL) field by one before forwarding the packet. If the TTL reaches zero, the router will not forward the packet and will typically send an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Time Exceeded message back to the sender.
