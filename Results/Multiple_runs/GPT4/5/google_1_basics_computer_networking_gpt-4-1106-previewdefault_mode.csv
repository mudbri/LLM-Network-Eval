12,What is the difference between full duplex and half duplex?,"a. Half duplex occurs when hubs are in use; full duplex occurs when switches are in use.
b. Full duplex allows communications in two directions at the same time; half duplex means that only one side can communicate at a time.
c. Full duplex is a form of simplex communications.
d. Full duplex is slower than half duplex.
",,b,b,,"Full duplex and half duplex refer to the mode of communication between devices over a network. Full duplex allows communication in both directions simultaneously, meaning data can be sent and received at the same time. This is typical in modern Ethernet networks using switches. On the other hand, half duplex means that communication can only occur in one direction at a time, not simultaneously. This was more common in legacy systems and when hubs were more prevalent. Half duplex can lead to collisions and is generally less efficient than full duplex. Option 'a' is misleading because it implies that the use of hubs or switches is what solely determines duplex mode, which is not accurate. Option 'c' is incorrect because full duplex is not a form of simplex communication; simplex is one-directional communication only. Option 'd' is incorrect as full duplex is generally faster than half duplex since it allows simultaneous bidirectional communication.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_(telecommunications)', 'https://www.lifewire.com/half-duplex-full-duplex-817578']",1,google_1_basics_computer_networking,0.95,0.9999955150656573
