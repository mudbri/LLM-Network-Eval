62,Which of the following are true of “network slicing”? Select all that apply.,"a. Network operators can use slicing to test configurations on “shadow” networks that mirror a production network topology.
b. One way to slice networks is according to “flow space”, whereby different controllers might control distinct and non-overlapping traffic flows.
c. A controller can prevent one network slice from interfering with the resources of another.
d. Multi-tenant datacenters are one use case for network slicing.
e. Conventional (i.e., non-SDN) networks have no concept of network virtualization or slicing.
",,"a,b,d","a,b,c,d",,"Network slicing is a concept that allows multiple virtual networks to be created atop a shared physical infrastructure. Here's why the selected options are correct: 

a. Network slicing can indeed be used for creating 'shadow' networks to test configurations without impacting the production network. This is a common use case in SDN environments where operators want to test changes before applying them.

b. Slicing networks according to 'flow space' is a valid approach. In SDN, different traffic flows can be managed by distinct controllers, ensuring that each slice handles specific types of traffic.

c. SDN controllers can enforce policies to prevent one network slice from using resources allocated to another, ensuring isolation between slices.

d. Multi-tenant datacenters benefit from network slicing as it allows each tenant to have a virtual network tailored to their specific needs, providing isolation and potentially customized services.

e. This statement is incorrect because conventional networks can also use network virtualization techniques such as VLANs and VPNs to create isolated network segments, which is a form of slicing.","['https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-the-definition-of-network-slicing/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking', 'https://www.networkworld.com/article/3259105/what-is-a-vlan-how-to-setup-a-vlan-in-a-network.html']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.95,0.9998982652228834
63,Which of the following are true about flow spaces? Select all that apply.,"a. Two flow spaces cannot overlap.
b. One host could send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces.
c. Flow spaces can only be defined according to combinations of packet header fields.
d. Flowspace isolation separates individual virtual networks from one another but incurs some performance penalty for doing so.
e. Two controllers that write data-plane rules for non-overlapping parts of flowspace can never cause traffic from one “slice” to enter the other slice.
",,b,"b,c,d",,"Flow spaces in Software Defined Networking (SDN) are defined by a combination of packet header fields such as source and destination IP addresses, transport protocol, and port numbers. These definitions allow for traffic to be classified into different flow spaces. Here's the breakdown of the choices:
a. This statement is not necessarily true. Flow spaces can overlap, and SDN controllers often have mechanisms to handle overlapping flow spaces.
b. This is true. Depending on the packet header fields, traffic from one host could match different flow space rules and thus end up in different flow spaces.
c. This is true. Flow spaces are typically defined by combinations of packet header fields, which are used to match traffic for processing by the SDN controller.
d. This is true. Flow space isolation is used to separate virtual networks, which can provide security and fault isolation benefits, but it may introduce a performance penalty due to the additional processing required.
e. This statement is false. Even if two controllers manage non-overlapping parts of the flow space, it is still possible for misconfigurations or specific network conditions to cause traffic to cross between slices unintentionally.","['https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6133528', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/software-defined-networking', 'https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261149565_FlowVisor_A_Network_Virtualization_Layer']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.95,0.541799172080464
64,Which of the following describe the control-plane checks that FlowVisor implements? Select all that apply.,"a. When a packet must be forwarded to a controller, Flowvisor forwards traffic to the correct controller based on which controller “owns” the flowspace corresponding to that packet.
b. Flowvisor prevents each slice's controller from being the target of a denial of service attack from other slices.
c. Flowvisor can only instantiate network slices based on the network topology, not based on other properties, such as application traffic.
d. Flowvisor prevents a controller from writing data-plane rules to a part of flowspace that it does not own.
e. Flowvisor installs traffic shaping and quality of service rules to ensure that each network slice has guaranteed resources.
",,"a,d","a,d",,"FlowVisor is a special purpose OpenFlow controller that acts as a transparent proxy between OpenFlow switches and multiple OpenFlow controllers. It creates network slices by demultiplexing the traffic and the control messages between the switches and the controllers. The correct options are: 

a. FlowVisor does indeed forward traffic to the correct controller based on which controller 'owns' the flowspace corresponding to that packet. This is part of its role in demultiplexing the traffic to the appropriate slice.

b. While FlowVisor does provide isolation between slices, preventing denial of service attacks from other slices is not explicitly mentioned as one of its control-plane checks. It's more focused on ensuring that the actions of one slice do not interfere with another, rather than actively preventing attacks.

c. FlowVisor can instantiate network slices based on various properties, not just the network topology. It can also consider properties such as the traffic type, making this option incorrect.

d. FlowVisor does prevent a controller from writing data-plane rules to a part of flowspace that it does not own. This is essential for maintaining the integrity of network slices and preventing one slice from interfering with another.

e. There is no mention in the standard capabilities of FlowVisor that it installs traffic shaping and quality of service rules to ensure guaranteed resources for each network slice. While FlowVisor does provide isolation between slices, resource guarantee mechanisms are typically implemented by the controller managing the slice, not FlowVisor itself.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/cs-flowvisor.pdf', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915011581']",1,8_data_center_virtualization,0.95,0.9997406050686842

b. Traceback of attack traffic to its source
c. Smart grid applications
d. Load balance of inbound traffic
e. Guest WiFi access
",,"a,c,e","a,c,e",,"Network slicing allows for the creation of multiple virtual networks on a common physical infrastructure. Each slice can be tailored to meet the specific requirements of different applications or services. 'a' is correct because network slicing can prioritize network resources for applications requiring high quality of service, such as video streaming. 'c' is correct because smart grid applications can benefit from network slicing by having a dedicated slice that ensures reliability and low latency for energy management. 'e' is correct because guest WiFi access can be provided through a separate network slice, ensuring that guests do not have access to the main network and its resources, enhancing security and performance. 'b' is not typically related to home network applications and is more about security and forensic capabilities in a broader networking context. 'd' refers to managing incoming network traffic to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed, which is generally more relevant to server farms or data centers than to home networks.","['https://www.ericsson.com/en/network-slicing', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9013228', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405959520300454']",1,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,0.9986914317930192

b. A home network owner running a private and public WiFi network
c. A retailer running a large, multi-site enterprise network across its global network of sites
d. Google running Gmail and search from a common facility
e. Two enterprises hosting data in a shared facility.
",,"a,d,e","a,d,e",,"Multi-tenancy in datacenters refers to the architecture where a single instance of a software application serves multiple customers, called tenants. Each tenant's data is isolated and remains invisible to other tenants. In the context of datacenters, this often involves virtualization and cloud services. Option 'a' is correct because Amazon's EC2 is a cloud service that hosts virtual instances for multiple customers. Option 'd' is correct because Google provides multiple services such as Gmail and search from its datacenters to multiple users, effectively making it multi-tenant. Option 'e' is also correct as two enterprises hosting data in a shared facility is a typical example of a multi-tenant arrangement. Option 'b' is not correct because a home network owner running private and public WiFi networks is not typically considered a datacenter application, nor does it involve datacenter-level multi-tenancy.

70,What best describes the relationship between network virtualization and SDN? Select all that apply.,"a. SDN controllers can help manage storage and data facilities, in addition to network configuration
b. SDN predates network virtualization
c. Network virtualization requires SDN
d. SDN makes some aspects of network virtualization easier to manage
e. Network virtualization enables SDN
",,"a,d","a,d",,"Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a technology that decouples the network control plane from the forwarding plane, allowing for more centralized and programmable network management. SDN controllers can indeed help manage storage and data facilities in addition to network configuration, which is why option (a) is correct. SDN also makes some aspects of network virtualization easier to manage by providing a more flexible and programmable network infrastructure, which supports the dynamic provisioning and management of virtual networks, thus making option (d) correct. While network virtualization can benefit from SDN, it does not strictly require SDN to function, as network virtualization can be implemented using other technologies as well. Therefore, option (c) is incorrect. SDN does not predate network virtualization; in fact, network virtualization concepts have been around in various forms for longer, so option (b) is incorrect. Lastly, while network virtualization can be used in conjunction with SDN, it is not correct to say that it enables SDN. SDN is enabled by the technologies that allow the separation of the control and data planes, not specifically by network virtualization, so option (e) is incorrect.","['https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-the-definition-of-software-defined-networking-sdn/', 'https://www.networkworld.com/article/2287045/what-is-network-virtualization-.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/what-is-sdn.html']",1,8_data_center_virtualization,0.95,0.9953619598014963
