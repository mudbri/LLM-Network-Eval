95,What are some benefits to using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Host configuration is simpler, since all hosts are visible from a single large Ethernet topology.
b. Forwarding on physical MAC addresses is simpler, since both the data center network topology and hosts' physical MAC addresses are hierarchical.
c. IP routing does not need to be reconfigured when physical or virtual machines move from one part of the network to another.
d. Scaling problems are simpler, since all hosts are configured on a single, flat topology.
e. Load balancing is easier on a layer-2 topology than on a layer 3 topology.
",,"a,c","a,c,d",,"Using a layer-2 MAC topology in a data center can offer several benefits. Option (a) is correct because in a layer-2 network, host configuration can be simpler due to the flat nature of the network where all hosts appear to be on the same local network segment. Option (c) is also correct as layer-2 networks allow for MAC addresses to remain consistent even when a host, such as a virtual machine, moves to a different physical location within the data center, thus IP routing does not need to be reconfigured. Option (d) is correct because a single, flat layer-2 network can be easier to scale out without having to deal with complex routing protocols or subnetting. However, option (b) is not correct because MAC addresses are not hierarchical by nature, and their flat nature can actually make forwarding more complex in large topologies. Finally, option (e) is incorrect because load balancing can be performed on both layer-2 and layer-3 topologies, and in many cases, layer-3 load balancing can be more flexible and efficient due to the ability to use routing protocols and techniques.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise/design-zone-data-centers/design-guide-content/layer2-layer3-design.html', 'https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/4906/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-layer-2-and-layer-3-networks']",0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,0.9981035557032453
96,"In PortLand, what are the reasons for assigning hosts pseudo-MAC addresses, as opposed to simply forwarding traffic on physical MAC addresses? Select all that apply.","a. Hosts in the data-center network topology are more vulnerable to attack if they expose their actual physical MAC addresses, rather than having a layer of indirection.
b. It is very difficult to load balance traffic using physical MAC addresses; pseudo MAC addresses make it possible to assign traffic to destination IP addresses.
c. Without pseudo-MAC addresses, switches would have to update forwarding state whenever hosts with a particular MAC address moved from one portion of the topology to another.
d. Forwarding loops are be more common in a flat layer-2 topology than they are in a topology with hierarchical pseudo MAC addresses.
e. In a flat layer-2 topology, switches cannot know on which port to forward traffic without maintaining switch tables for each MAC address, since MAC addresses are flat, not hierarchical.
",,"c,e","c,e",,"PortLand is a network design that aims to improve scalability and manageability of large data center networks by using a technique known as 'location-independent addressing'. This technique assigns pseudo-MAC addresses to hosts rather than using their physical MAC addresses. The reasons for this include:

- c. Without pseudo-MAC addresses, switches would indeed have to update forwarding state whenever hosts move within the network, which is common in a virtualized data center environment. Pseudo-MAC addresses help maintain a consistent address that does not change with the host's location, simplifying the network's response to mobility.

- e. In a flat layer-2 topology, which is typical for large-scale data centers, the use of hierarchical pseudo-MAC addresses can simplify the forwarding process. Switches can make forwarding decisions based on the hierarchical structure of the addresses, reducing the size of the forwarding tables needed.

Options a and b are incorrect because pseudo-MAC addresses are not primarily used for security purposes or load balancing. Option d is incorrect because forwarding loops are a separate issue that can occur in any topology and are typically addressed by spanning tree protocols or other loop prevention mechanisms, not by the addressing scheme itself.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking', 'https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2009/papers/portland-sigcomm09.pdf']",1,13_SDN_use_cases,0.95,0.5239459336718879
97,What are the steps involved in the Proxy ARP process that PortLand's Fabric Manager runs?,"a. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns returns PMAC directly to the end host.
b. Edge switch sends ARP query to fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch updates its local PMAC mapping table.
c. Host sends ARP query, fabric manager intercepts ARP query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to end host.
d. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to the host.
e. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch returns PMAC to end host.
",,e,e,,"In the Proxy ARP process used by PortLand's Fabric Manager, when a host sends an ARP query for another host within the same subnet, the edge switch intercepts the ARP query. Instead of broadcasting this query to all ports, the edge switch forwards the query to the Fabric Manager. The Fabric Manager then looks up the Physical MAC (PMAC) address associated with the IP address in the query from its PMAC mapping table. Once the Fabric Manager has the PMAC, it sends this information back to the edge switch. The edge switch, in turn, updates its local PMAC mapping table and sends the PMAC back to the end host that originated the ARP query. This process helps in reducing ARP traffic within the network and allows the Fabric Manager to maintain a central repository of PMAC to IP address mappings.","['https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sigcomm09/tech/full_papers/niranjan_mysore.pdf', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_ARP', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/sw/4_2/nx-os/unicast/configuration/guide/l3_cli_nxos/l3_arp.html#wp1054047']",1,13_SDN_use_cases,0.95,0.9569718431096526
98,"What are some of the disadvantages of today's interdomain routing protocol, BGP? Select all that apply.","a. ISPs cannot load-balance traffic across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix.
b. Routing and forwarding decisions are only based on IP prefix, not on a broader range of traffic flow attributes.
c. ISPs can only influence route selection through indirect mechanisms (e.g., prepending), rather than directly manipulating the forwarding table entries in switches.

ISPs can influence route selection through indirect mechanisms such as AS path prepending, local preference, and MEDs, but they cannot directly manipulate the forwarding table entries in other autonomous systems' switches (c). Furthermore, ISPs can influence the routing decisions of their immediate BGP neighbors through these mechanisms, but they have limited ability to influence the entire end-to-end path of a route across multiple ASes (e).

",,"b,d,e","a,b,d,e",,"Software Defined Exchanges (SDXs) enable advanced features that traditional Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) cannot support due to their static nature.

'a' is correct because SDXs can apply different business relationships in different regions through programmable policies. 'b' is correct as SDXs can facilitate application-specific peering decisions, allowing traffic to be steered based on the type of application. 'd' is correct because SDXs can dynamically redirect traffic to various middleboxes (like firewalls, load balancers, etc.) on-the-fly without the need for manual configuration changes.
