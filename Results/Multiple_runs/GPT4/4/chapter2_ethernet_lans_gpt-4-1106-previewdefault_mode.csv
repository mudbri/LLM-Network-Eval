28,A Layer 2 switch configuration places all its physical ports into VLAN 2. The IP addressing plan shows that address 175.28.1.150 (with mask 255.255.255.0) is reserved for use by this new LAN switch and that 175.28.1.254 is already configured on the router connected to that same VLAN. The switch needs to support SSH connections into the switch from any subnet in the network. Which of the following commands are part of the required configuration in this case? (Choose two answers.),"a. The switch cannot support SSH because all its ports connect to VLAN 2, and the IP address must be configured on interface VLAN 1.
b. The ip address 175.28.1.150 255.255.255.0 command in interface vlan 2 configuration mode.

e. The ip default-gateway 175.28.1.150 command in global configuration mode.

Additionally, a default gateway needs to be specified so that the switch can communicate with other subnets. The command for this is 'ip default-gateway 175.28.1.254' in global configuration mode. Option a is incorrect because the IP address can be configured on any VLAN interface, not just VLAN 1. Option d is incorrect because the IP address belongs to a different subnet and is not part of the VLAN 2 address range. Option e is incorrect because the default gateway should be the router's IP address, not the switch's own IP address.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13769-5.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst2960/software/release/12-2_55_se/configuration/guide/scg_2960/swipaddr.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security-vpn/secure-shell-ssh/4145-ssh.html']",1,chapter2_ethernet_lans,0.95,0.9999996871837189
