179,"When APs are placed at different geographic locations, they can all be interconnected by a switched infrastructure. The 802.11 standard calls this an extended service set (ESS).","a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",,a,a,,"An Extended Service Set (ESS) is a set of two or more Basic Service Sets (BSSs) that form a single subnetwork. Access Points (APs) in an ESS are typically connected by a distribution system, which is often an Ethernet backbone or switched infrastructure. This allows for seamless roaming within a geographic area as the infrastructure appears as a single network to the wireless client.
