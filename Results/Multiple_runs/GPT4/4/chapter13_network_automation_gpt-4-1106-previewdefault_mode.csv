218,Which of the following configuration management tools uses agentless architecture for managing network devices?,"a. Ansible
b. Puppet
c. Chef
d. Ansible and Puppet
e. Puppet and Chef
",,a,a,,"Among the configuration management tools listed, Ansible is known for its agentless architecture. This means that Ansible does not require any agent software to be installed on the nodes it manages, instead it relies on SSH or other remote protocols to execute commands and manage configurations. Puppet and Chef, on the other hand, typically require an agent to be installed on the managed nodes for configuration management tasks.","['https://www.ansible.com/overview/how-ansible-works', 'https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/architecture.html', 'https://docs.chef.io/chef_overview/']",1,chapter13_network_automation,0.95,0.9999937270200753
