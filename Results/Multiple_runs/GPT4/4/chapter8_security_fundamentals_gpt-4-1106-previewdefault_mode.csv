137,"In a spoofing attack, which of the following parameters are commonly spoofed? (Choose two answers)","a. Source IP address
b. MAC address
c. ARP address
d. Routing table
e. Destination IP address
f. ARP table
",,"a,b","a,b",,"In a spoofing attack, attackers commonly fake or 'spoof' the source IP address to make it appear as though packets are coming from a trusted source, thereby bypassing IP-based security measures. MAC address spoofing is also common, where the attacker changes the MAC address of their network interface to impersonate another device on the local network. 'ARP address' is not a term typically used in networking; however, ARP spoofing is a related concept where an attacker sends falsified ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages over a local area network, which could lead to the corruption of the ARP table. The routing table and destination IP address are generally not the targets of spoofing; instead, they could be indirectly affected by other types of attacks. The ARP table can be a target for ARP spoofing attacks, but the question likely refers to the parameters that are directly spoofed, which are the source IP address and MAC address.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ip-spoofing.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_spoofing', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing']",1,chapter8_security_fundamentals,0.95,0.9720886951079271
