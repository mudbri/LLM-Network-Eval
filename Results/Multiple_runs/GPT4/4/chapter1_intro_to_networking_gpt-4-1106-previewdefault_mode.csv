1,Which of the following terms describe Ethernet addresses that can send one frame and is delivered to multiple devices on the LAN? (Choose two answers.),"a. Broadcast address
b. Multicast address
c. IP address
d. MAC address
e. Unicast address
",,"a,b","a,b",,"In Ethernet networking, a broadcast address is used to send a frame to all devices on a local area network (LAN). This is typically represented by the MAC address FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF. A multicast address allows a frame to be sent to a specific group of devices on a LAN that are configured to listen for messages sent to that multicast address. Both broadcast and multicast addresses enable the delivery of a frame to multiple devices, unlike unicast addresses which are used to send a frame to a single specific device.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/express-forwarding-cef/13749-12.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_address', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_address']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,0.95,0.9999993743675457
