b. FALSE
",,a,a,,"The statement is true. In MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching) networks, the customer edge (CE) device is typically a router located at the customer's premises. It connects to the provider edge (PE) router, which is part of the service provider's network. The CE router is responsible for communicating with the PE router to send and receive data between the customer site and the provider's MPLS network.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/multiprotocol-label-switching-mpls/mpls/4641-mpls-faq-4641.html', 'https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/mpls/topics/concept/mpls-glossary.html']",1,chapter12_network_design_architecture,1,0.9999917005724405

",,a,a,,"A full mesh network design is one where each node in the network has a direct link to every other node. This design ensures maximum redundancy and reliability, as there is always an alternative path if one link fails. In contrast, a star topology connects all nodes to a central hub, a hybrid combines elements of different topologies, and a partial mesh has some, but not all, nodes connected in a mesh pattern.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/cloud-systems-management/network-automation/200933-Understanding-Network-Topology-Architect.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking']",1,chapter12_network_design_architecture,1,1.0

b. Distribution
c. Core
d. Campus
",,a,a,,"In a hierarchical network design, the access layer is where end-user devices connect to the network. The access layer switches are responsible for connecting devices like computers, printers, and phones to the network, providing them with direct access to network resources. The distribution layer aggregates the data from the access layer switches before it moves to the core layer, which is responsible for fast and efficient transport across the network. The term 'campus' is generally used to describe the entire network of a campus but is not a specific role of a switch in the hierarchical model.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/what-is-a-campus-network.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/lan-switching/lan-switching-architecture/17056-understandcampus.html']",1,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,0.9999998063873687

211,Your company plans to start using public cloud service and now you are considering different WAN options. Your main concern is security by keeping the data private while also providing good QoS services. Which of the following options are under consideration? (Choose two answers.),"a. Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider
b. Using an Internet connection without VPN
c. Using an Internet connection with VPN
d. Using an intercloud exchange
",,"a,d","a,c",,"When considering WAN options for connecting to a public cloud service with a focus on security and QoS, the following options are viable: a) Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider ensures that the data remains private as it does not traverse the public internet. This also allows for better QoS since the connection is dedicated and can be managed end-to-end. c) Using an Internet connection with VPN also provides security by encrypting the data that is sent over the public internet, ensuring privacy. The QoS might not be as good as with a private WAN connection due to the variability of the Internet, but it is more secure than an unencrypted connection.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/what-is-sd-wan.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/what-is-a-vpn.html']",0,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,0.9999967518919751

213,"A company uses a Metro Ethernet WAN with an Ethernet LAN (E-LAN) service, with the company headquarters plus 20 remote sites connected to the service. The enterprise uses OSPF at all sites, with one router connected to the service from each site. Which of the following are true about the Layer 3 details most likely used with this service and design? (Choose all that apply)","a. The WAN uses one IP subnet
b. The WAN uses 20 or more IP subnets
c. A remote site router would have one OSPF neighbor
d. A remote site router would have 20 OSPF neighbors
",,"a,d","a,c",,"In a Metro Ethernet E-LAN service, all sites appear as if they are on the same Layer 2 network, which allows them to be on the same IP subnet (a). Since OSPF is being used, each site will see all other sites as OSPF neighbors. However, from the perspective of any single remote site router, it would see the headquarters router as an OSPF neighbor and potentially other remote site routers if they are designed to connect to each other directly within the E-LAN (c). The number of OSPF neighbors for a remote site router would not necessarily be 20 as it depends on the specific topology and OSPF design implemented. It is not typical for each remote site router to have direct OSPF adjacencies with all other remote sites in an E-LAN topology, as this would create a full mesh which is generally avoided due to its complexity and the number of adjacencies it would create.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Enterprise/WAN_and_MAN/MetroEthernetEPL_EPLAN.html', 'https://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2756480']",0,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,0.9964400914528772
