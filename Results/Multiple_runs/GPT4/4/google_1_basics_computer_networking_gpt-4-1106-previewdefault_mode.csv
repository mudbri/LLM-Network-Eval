12,What is the difference between full duplex and half duplex?,"a. Half duplex occurs when hubs are in use; full duplex occurs when switches are in use.
b. Full duplex allows communications in two directions at the same time; half duplex means that only one side can communicate at a time.
c. Full duplex is a form of simplex communications.
d. Full duplex is slower than half duplex.
",,b,b,,"Full duplex and half duplex refer to the ability of a communication channel to send and receive signals. Full duplex allows communication in both directions simultaneously, meaning devices can send and receive data at the same time. Half duplex, on the other hand, only allows communication in one direction at a time; devices must take turns to send or receive data. While it's true that hubs typically operate in half duplex and switches in full duplex, this is not the defining difference between the two modes. Full duplex is not a form of simplex communication, which is a mode where signals can only travel in one direction and never the opposite way. Additionally, full duplex is not inherently slower than half duplex; in fact, it can be more efficient for certain applications because it allows for continuous two-way communication without the need to switch directions.","['https://www.lifewire.com/duplex-half-duplex-full-duplex-817580', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_(telecommunications)']",1,google_1_basics_computer_networking,0.95,0.9999955150656573
