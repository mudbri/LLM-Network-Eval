1,Which of the following are true about Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)? Select all that apply.,"a. The only sizes for an IP address allocation before CIDR were 8, 16, or 24 bits.
b. The prefix length for a CIDR prefix can be anywhere in the range from 0 to 32 bits.
c. In an Internet forwarding table with CIDR, there can only be one unique matching entry for any given IP address.
d. CIDR slowed the rate of Internet routing table growth because prefixes no longer had to be allocated in fixed-size blocks.
",,"b,d","b,c,d",,"CIDR, or Classless Inter-Domain Routing, was introduced to improve the allocation of IP addresses and the scalability of route aggregation. Here is why the selected answers are true:

- b. The prefix length for a CIDR prefix can indeed be anywhere in the range from 0 to 32 bits. This flexibility allows for more efficient use of IP address space compared to the classful addressing system.

- c. In an Internet forwarding table with CIDR, there can only be one unique matching entry for any given IP address. This is because the longest prefix match rule is used, ensuring that each IP address is matched to the most specific route available in the table.

- d. CIDR slowed the rate of Internet routing table growth because it allowed for more efficient IP address allocation and route aggregation. By allowing networks to be divided into arbitrarily-sized blocks, CIDR reduced the need for numerous small, classful network allocations, which in turn reduced the number of routes that had to be advertised.

The statement a is not true because before CIDR, IP address allocations were based on classful network design, which had fixed block sizes of class A (8 bits), B (16 bits), and C (24 bits) networks, but there were also class D for multicast and class E for experimental use, which are not commonly used for standard IP address allocations.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4632']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9851380832666822
2,Which of the following are true about how DNS lookups work? Select all that apply.,"a. A DNS A-record query for google.com will only return a single IP address at a time.
b. An NS-record query for a DNS lookup will return the name(s) of the authoritative name server(s) for that domain.
c. If your local DNS resolver caches an NS record for google.com for multiple days, all clients who use that DNS resolver will continue using the same IP address to reach Google’s Web server until that NS record expires.
d. An MX-record query for a DNS lookup will return the IP address of the mail server for that domain.
e. All DNS PTR records are maintained by a single organization in-addr.arpa.
",,b,"b,d",,"Option (b) is correct because an NS-record (Name Server record) indeed points to the authoritative name server(s) for the domain, which is essential for delegating the responsibility of a sub-domain or a domain to another DNS server. Option (d) is also correct as an MX-record (Mail Exchange record) specifies the mail server responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a domain and may also specify the priority of mail servers if there are multiple ones available.

Option (a) is incorrect because a DNS A-record (Address record) query for a domain like google.com can return multiple IP addresses, not just a single one, for load balancing and fault tolerance purposes. Option (c) is incorrect because an NS record cache does not determine the IP address clients use to reach a web server; it only determines which name servers are authoritative for the domain. The A or AAAA records, which are cached separately, determine the actual IP addresses used to reach the web server. Lastly, option (e) is incorrect because while PTR records for IPv4 addresses are indeed delegated within the in-addr.arpa domain, they are not maintained by a single organization; rather, the responsibility is distributed among the owners of the IP addresses (usually ISPs or organizations that own the IP address blocks).","['https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-ns-record/', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-mx-record/', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-a-record/', 'https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/db/support/documentation/ripe-database-documentation/reverse-dns/how-to-set-up-reverse-delegation']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9794127948534451
3,Which of the following are true about traffic control with BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
b. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
c. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
d. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
",,"a,b","a,b",,"a. The BGP local preference attribute is used to influence the outbound traffic from an Autonomous System (AS). It determines the preferred path for outbound traffic when there are multiple exit points from an AS. A higher local preference value is preferred over a lower one.

b. AS path prepending is a technique used to influence inbound traffic to an AS by making a path appear less attractive. By adding its own AS number multiple times to the AS_PATH attribute, a network operator can make a route look longer and therefore less preferable to external BGP peers, which can influence the path that inbound traffic takes.

c. BGP AS path prepending does not control outbound traffic; it is used for influencing inbound traffic as described in option b.

d. The BGP local preference attribute does not control inbound traffic; it is used for influencing outbound traffic as described in option a.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/13759-37.html', 'https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/bgp/topics/topic-map/bgp-route-selection.html']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9958680909047405
4,Which of the following are true about layering? Select all that apply.,"a. The network layer guarantees reliable, in-order delivery of packets.
b. The network layer has only a single protocol in widespread use today, representing what we call the “narrow waist”.
c. The transport layer uses port numbers.
d. The destination address in the link layer header is always the address of the next layer-3 node along an end-to-end IP path.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"Layering refers to the design of network architectures in layers, each with specific functions and protocols. The network layer does not guarantee reliable, in-order delivery of packets; that is a function typically provided by the transport layer using protocols like TCP. Therefore, option (a) is incorrect. The network layer indeed has a single protocol in widespread use today: the Internet Protocol (IP), which represents the 'narrow waist' of the Internet protocol suite. Thus, option (b) is correct. The transport layer uses port numbers to distinguish between different services or applications running on the same host, so option (c) is correct. The destination address in the link layer header is the address of the next node (hop) along the path, which may not be the final layer-3 node (destination host) in an end-to-end IP path, making option (d) incorrect.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_layer']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9998172588791931
5,Which of the following are not true about packet switching? Select all that apply.,"a. Once a connection is established between two endpoints in a packet switched network, the end-to-end route cannot change, or the connection must be re-established.
b. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will always experience predictable latency.
c. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will never be dropped by intermediate nodes along the path.
d. A user of a packet switched network might occasionally get a “busy signal” if there are too many users on the network.
",,"a,b,c,d","a,b,c",,"Packet switching is a digital networking communications method that groups all transmitted data into suitably sized blocks, called packets. In contrast to circuit switching where a dedicated path is established between two endpoints, packet switching allows for dynamic routing of packets, which means that the end-to-end route can change during the course of a connection. Therefore, statement 'a' is not true. Statement 'b' is also incorrect because packet-switched networks do not always provide predictable latency; latency can vary due to dynamic routing and network congestion. Statement 'c' is not true because packets can indeed be dropped by intermediate nodes if the network is congested or if errors occur; packet-switched networks do not guarantee delivery. Statement 'd' is not applicable to packet-switched networks as 'busy signals' are characteristic of circuit-switched networks where a dedicated circuit is required for communication.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_switching', 'https://www.techopedia.com/definition/2603/packet-switched-network-psn']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9780539775122601
6,Which of the following are true about content distribution networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Content distribution networks can improve the performance that a client sees by reducing the network latency between the client and the content that it is downloading.
b. Content distribution networks can reduce transit expenses for a content provider by enabling much of the provider’s content to be served from a nearby network, sometimes even from a cache that is within the client’s own network.
c. Real-time content such as video streams cannot be distributed from a content distribution network.
d. Content distribution networks typically redirect Web clients to a nearby Web cache by rewriting the IP address of packets sent from the client to the IP address of the nearby Web cache.
",,"a,b","a,b,d",,"Content distribution networks (CDNs) are designed to improve the delivery of content to clients across the internet. Option (a) is correct because CDNs distribute content across various locations closer to the end-users, thereby reducing the network latency and improving performance. Option (b) is also correct since CDNs can help reduce transit costs for content providers by serving content from locations closer to the end-users, which can include caches within the user's own network. Option (c) is incorrect because CDNs are indeed used to distribute real-time content, including video streams; they are designed to handle various types of content, including dynamic content. Option (d) is correct because CDNs often use DNS redirection or URL rewriting to direct clients to the nearest server with the requested content, which can involve rewriting the destination IP to that of a nearby cache.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/', 'https://aws.amazon.com/cdn/', 'https://www.akamai.com/our-thinking/cdn/what-is-a-content-delivery-network-cdn']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9999952022506093
7,Which of the following are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control? Select all that apply.,"a. Only wireless networks can have collisions at the receiver; such collisions are not possible on wired Ethernet networks.
b. Using RTS/CTS (“request to send”, “clear to send”) control reduces the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network.
c. A wireless sender can avoid causing a collision at the receiver by performing a “carrier sense” to determine whether any other sender wants to transmit at the time that it wishes to send a packet.
d. Disabling RTS/CTS necessarily lowers the effective throughput of the wireless network, since more collisions will occur at the receiver without RTS/CTS enabled.
",,b,"b,c",,"b. Using RTS/CTS control frames in 802.11 wireless networks helps to avoid the hidden node problem, where two devices, out of range of each other, may cause a collision by sending data to a third device that is in range of both. However, the overhead of these control frames (RTS and CTS) can reduce the overall achievable throughput of the network because they consume airtime that could otherwise be used for data transmission.

 c. Carrier sense is a technique used in wireless networks where a device listens to the medium (air) to determine if another device is transmitting. If the medium is determined to be busy, the device will wait for a random backoff period before attempting to transmit, thereby reducing the likelihood of collisions occurring at the receiver.

a. is incorrect because wired Ethernet networks can also have collisions, especially in networks using the CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) protocol.

d. is incorrect because while RTS/CTS can help prevent collisions, it is not universally true that disabling RTS/CTS will lower effective throughput. In networks with low traffic or where nodes are not hidden from each other, the overhead of RTS/CTS can outweigh its benefits, and disabling it could actually improve throughput.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-sense_multiple_access_with_collision_avoidance', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_sense_multiple_access_with_collision_detection', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11#RTS/CTS']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9997586304486183
8,Which of the following are true about video streaming? Select all that apply.,"a. Using UDP to stream a video instead of TCP is appropriate if the client is more concerned about low delay and interactivity than it does about receiving a high-quality stream.
b. A larger playout buffer at the client allows the client more time to recover from lost packets.
c. Using TCP for video streaming could result in larger delays between transmission and playout than streaming the same video with UDP.
d. Since UDP provides no reliable delivery guarantees, a video streaming application that uses UDP as its transport cannot recover from any packet loss in the video stream.
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"a. UDP is often used for streaming media applications such as video conferencing where timely delivery is more important than perfect delivery. It is well-suited for situations where you prefer low delay and can tolerate some loss in data quality. Therefore, this statement is true.

b. A larger playout buffer at the client can indeed help in smoothing out the variations in packet arrival time and can provide additional time to recover from packet loss by using error correction techniques or retransmissions if supported. Hence, this statement is also true.

c. TCP includes congestion control and flow control mechanisms, which can introduce additional delays in the streaming of video as the protocol ensures reliable and ordered delivery. This can result in larger delays compared to UDP, which does not have these mechanisms and can send data as fast as the application generates it. Therefore, this statement is true.

d. This statement is false because even though UDP does not provide reliable delivery guarantees, applications can implement their own mechanisms on top of UDP to handle packet loss, such as forward error correction or retransmission strategies. The absence of built-in reliability in UDP does not prevent an application from implementing its own recovery procedures.","['https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3550', 'Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach (7th Edition) by James F. Kurose and Keith W. Ross']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9999944126236294
9,Which of the following are true about TCP? Select all that apply.,"a. TCP guarantees that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted.
b. A TCP sender and receiver use a “three-way handshake” both to set up and to terminate the TCP connection.
c. TCP’s congestion avoidance algorithm causes the sender to reduce its sending rate by a factor of two when it sees a packet loss.
d. A TCP sender controls its sending rate by adjusting the number of unacknowledged packets that can be sent over the network at any time.
",,"a,c,d","a,b,c,d",,"All of the statements provided are true characteristics of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). (a) TCP ensures reliable in-order delivery of a stream of bytes, which means that the receiver sees the same sequence of bytes as sent by the sender. (b) TCP uses a three-way handshake to establish a connection before any data can be sent, and it also uses a modified version of the handshake to terminate the connection. (c) TCP uses a congestion avoidance algorithm such as TCP Tahoe or TCP Reno, which typically reduces the congestion window size by half when packet loss is detected, indicating network congestion. This reduction in the congestion window size effectively reduces the sending rate. (d) TCP uses a flow control mechanism to control the sending rate by adjusting the size of the congestion window, which limits the number of unacknowledged packets that can be in transit.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793', 'https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc5681']",0,1_SDN_Basics,1,0.9990665746640613
10,Which of the following are true about denial of service attacks (and defenses)? Select all that apply.,"a. If every network on the Internet performed stateless ingress filtering to defend against source IP spoofing, the DNS reflection attack would not work.
b. If every network on the Internet performed stateless egress filtering to defend against source IP address spoofing, the DNS reflection attack could not be carried out.
c. In a “SYN Flood” attack, each TCP SYN packet that a victim receives causes it to set up TCP connection state.
d. A “DNS Reflection” attack requires the attacking client to “spoof” the source IP address of the packet containing the DNS request.
",,"b,c,d","a,c,d",,"a. True. Stateless ingress filtering is a technique used to ensure that incoming packets have a source IP address that matches the network prefix of the interface on which they arrive. If every network performed this kind of filtering, it would be very difficult for attackers to use IP address spoofing to make the traffic appear to come from a legitimate source, which is necessary for a DNS reflection attack to be successful.
c. True. In a SYN Flood attack, the attacker sends a large number of TCP SYN packets to the victim's server, each of which causes the server to allocate resources and create a half-open TCP connection. This can exhaust the server's resources, leading to a denial of service.
d. True. A DNS Reflection attack involves an attacker sending a DNS query with a spoofed source IP address (the victim's IP). The DNS servers then send the large DNS response to the victim's IP address, which can overwhelm the victim's network with traffic.
b. False. Egress filtering is the process of monitoring and potentially restricting the flow of outbound traffic. While it's useful for a network to ensure that packets leaving its network have a legitimate source IP address, this alone would not prevent a DNS reflection attack because the attacker can use a different network that does not perform such filtering to generate the spoofed traffic.","['https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-004', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingress_filtering', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/dns-amplification-ddos-attack/']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9843652200350328
