23,Which of the following are examples of control plane operations? Select all that apply.,"a. Rate-limiting traffic so that the overall sending rate does not exceed a certain throughput.
b. Determining that a user's MAC address is authentic before allowing it to send traffic on the network.
c. Load balancing traffic across two output ports based on the hash of each packet's source IP address.
d. Determining the forwarding path that satisfies an access control policy.
e. Computing a shortest path routing tree.
",,"b,d,e","b,d,e",,"Control plane operations involve making decisions about how traffic should be handled in the network. These decisions include the routing of packets, access control, and network policies. Specifically:

- Option (b) refers to an access control operation, which is a control plane functionality. It involves determining the legitimacy of a device before it is allowed to participate in the network.

- Option (d) involves applying a network policy to determine the path that traffic should take through the network. This is a core function of the control plane.

- Option (e) is about computing routing tables or paths, which is a fundamental control plane task. Routing algorithms calculate the best paths for traffic to take through the network.

Options (a) and (c), on the other hand, are more related to data plane operations. The data plane is responsible for the actual handling of packets as per the control plane's decisions, including rate-limiting (a) and load balancing (c) based on predefined rules.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_plane', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/inside-sdn-control-plane-data-plane/']",1,4_control_and_data_separation,0.95,0.9894866701587977
25,What could be the operational steps behind the AT&T's IRSCP (a commercial version of the Routing Control Platform) for detecting malicious traffic? Select all that apply.,"a. The controller sees all traffic passing through the network, detects an attack, and installs a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where the attack traffic is originating.
b. The end host changes its IP address so that it is no longer the target of the attack traffic.
c. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to re-route traffic through a deep-packet inspection device.
d. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to install a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where attack traffic is originating.
e. A victim end host sends an alert to an on-path firewall about the source and nature of an attack, at which point the firewall installs a null route to drop the traffic at the entry point where the attack is originating.
",,"c,d","a,c,d",,"AT&T's IRSCP (Integrated Routing and Service Control Point) is designed to enhance network control and security. Given the options, the following could be operational steps in detecting and mitigating malicious traffic within such a system: 

a. The controller having visibility of all network traffic is a key feature of SDN (Software Defined Networking), allowing it to detect attacks and install null routes to prevent the attack traffic from flowing through the network. 

c. A measurement system detecting an attack and instructing a controller to reroute traffic for further inspection is a plausible step, as it involves the detection and subsequent action to mitigate the attack. Deep-packet inspection devices are commonly used for more detailed analysis of traffic, which is consistent with the principles of SDN where network control is centralized and programmable. 

d. Similar to option a, the measurement system detecting the attack and instructing the controller to install a null route aligns with the SDN approach to network management and security, where the controller can dynamically update routing to respond to security threats. 

Options b and e are less likely in the context of SDN, as they suggest actions taken by end hosts rather than network controllers. Changing IP addresses at the host level (b) is not typically a network controller function, and while end hosts can alert firewalls (e), this does not involve the SDN controller directly detecting and mitigating the attack.","['https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-the-definition-of-software-defined-networking-sdn/', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7116166', 'https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/nsdi06/tech/full_papers/greenberg/greenberg.pdf']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.9,0.9570871722034677

e. Forecasting of network capacity.
",,"a,b,d","a,b,d,e",,"The separation of the control and data planes in Software Defined Networking (SDN) simplifies various network management tasks. 'a' is correct because with SDN, security policies and routing decisions can be centrally controlled and enforced, improving interdomain routing security.

c. Better security properties.
d. Better scaling properties.
e. Better load balancing properties.

28,How does the separation of the control and data plane make networking in data centers easier?,"a. Virtual machines can be migrated within the network without renumbering entire portions of the network or re-assigning network services to different IP addresses.
b. The control plane allows traffic to be forwarded using Layer 2 addresses, thus allowing automatic load balance across the topology.
c. The separation allows fewer switches to be used in the data center topology, thus lowering costs.
d. All routes can be controlled and monitored from a central point of control.
e. A network controller can permit the renumbering of end hosts to have topology-dependent Layer 2 MAC addresses.
",,"a,d,e","a,d",,"The separation of the control and data planes in Software Defined Networking (SDN) allows for centralized management and greater flexibility in network operations. Virtual machines can indeed be migrated without the need to renumber or reassign network services (a), which simplifies network management in dynamic data center environments. Furthermore, having a central point of control (d) enables network administrators to monitor and modify routes efficiently, enhancing the network's responsiveness to changing requirements. Option (b) incorrectly attributes automatic load balancing to the control plane's use of Layer 2 addresses, which is not a direct consequence of control and data plane separation. Option (c) is also incorrect because the number of switches used is not inherently reduced by the separation of planes; it may lead to more efficient use of existing switches, but does not necessarily reduce their quantity. Option (e) is incorrect as renumbering end hosts to have topology-dependent MAC addresses is not a standard feature or direct benefit of control and data plane separation.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/software-defined-access/index.html', 'https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-defined-networks/9781491902934/ch01.html']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.95,0.9999988975533077

b. Inability to respond to link failures.
c. Incorrect security policies.
d. Incorrect operation when one controller fails.
e. Forwarding loops.

Forwarding loops (e) can be created if inconsistent or out-of-sync routing information is distributed by the controllers.

30,What are some approaches to coping with inconsistency across controller replicas? Select all that apply.,"a. Running a consistency protocol across controller replicas.
b. Keeping a ""hot spare"" replica that has a complete view of the network state.
c. Only keeping a subset of the network state in memory at any time.
d. Using different controllers for independent parts of the network.
e. Having multiple controllers install forwarding table entries on the same router and resolving the conflict on the router itself.
",,"a,b,c,d","a,b,d",,"In the context of Software Defined Networking (SDN), consistency across controller replicas is crucial for maintaining a coherent network state and ensuring reliable network operations. Here are the reasons for selecting the given options:

a. Running a consistency protocol across controller replicas is a standard approach to ensure that all replicas have the same view of the network state. This can involve distributed consensus algorithms like Raft or Paxos.

b. Keeping a 'hot spare' replica means that there is a fully synchronized backup controller ready to take over immediately if the primary controller fails. This helps in maintaining consistency because the 'hot spare' has an up-to-date copy of the network state.

d. Using different controllers for independent parts of the network can help in reducing the complexity of maintaining consistency because each controller only needs to keep track of its own segment of the network, which is independent of the others.

Option c is not an approach to coping with inconsistency; it could actually introduce inconsistency if not managed properly. Option e is also not a typical approach to handling inconsistency, as it could lead to unpredictable behavior in the network and conflicts are generally resolved at the controller level, not on the routers themselves.","['https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6602305', 'https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi16/technical-sessions/presentation/ding']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.95,0.8113379365486469

e. Running multiple controllers, and having each controller only manage a part of the network.
",,"a,b,c,e","a,c,e",,"In Software Defined Networking (SDN), the control plane is separated from the data plane to provide centralized management and programmability. However, this separation can introduce scalability challenges. To cope with these challenges, several approaches can be implemented: 

a. Caching forwarding decisions in the data plane can help reduce the amount of traffic that needs to be sent to the controller for decision-making, thus improving scalability. 

c. Eliminating redundant data structures can optimize the use of resources and improve the efficiency of the network's operation, which in turn helps in scaling. 

e. Running multiple controllers with each managing a part of the network (also known as controller clustering or partitioning) can distribute the load and improve scalability by preventing a single controller from becoming a bottleneck.

Option b is not typically a scalability strategy, as limiting control-plane operations could restrict the flexibility and functionality of the network. Option d is incorrect because sending all traffic through the controller would significantly increase the load on the controller, making the network less scalable and introducing a potential single point of failure.","['https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/software-defined-networking', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6888898', 'https://www.networkworld.com/article/2287044/what-is-software-defined-networking-.html']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.95,0.8631909304209678
32,"Which property guarantees that each RCP replica continues to install correct forwarding state in the network data plane, even in the case of a partition in the data plane?","a. Each controller has a complete view of the portion of the network that it is controlling, and therefore can guarantee consistent routing within that partition.
b. The controller cannot see many of the routers in the network anyway, so there is no way for it to install incorrect routing state in the routers that it is not connected to.
c. The controllers are partitioned from the network routers, and the routers will fall back to running a distributed routing protocol.
d. Running the network from a single high-level control plane guarantees that network partitions and loops never occur in the first place.
",,a,a,,"The property described in the question is related to the ability of a Software Defined Networking (SDN) controller to maintain a consistent view of the network, or at least the portion it controls, despite network partitions. Option 'a' is correct because if each controller maintains a complete and accurate view of its domain, it can ensure that the forwarding state it installs is consistent within that partition. This does not prevent partitions but ensures that routing remains consistent within each partition. The other options either misunderstand the nature of SDN's centralized control (b and d) or describe a fallback to distributed routing, which is not a property of the RCP (Routing Control Platform) itself (c).","['https://www.opennetworking.org/software-defined-standards/overview/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking']",1,4_control_and_data_separation,0.95,0.9929129037552443
