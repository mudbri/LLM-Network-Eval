90,The protocol used to communicate network errors is known as __________.,"a. ICMP
b. Traceroute
c. TCP
d. UDP
",,a,a,,"The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is used to communicate network errors as well as other network operational information. It is used by network devices, like routers, to send error messages indicating, for instance, that a requested service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached. ICMP is part of the Internet Protocol Suite as defined in RFC 792. Traceroute uses ICMP but is a utility to trace the path packets take to reach a host. TCP and UDP are transport layer protocols used for data transmission but do not specifically communicate network errors.","['https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc792', 'https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1256.txt']",1,google_6_troubleshooting_and_future_networking,1,1.0

b. Echo Reply
c. Destination Network Unknown
d. Destination Network Unreachable
",,a,a,,"The ping utility is used to test the reachability of a host on an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

",,c,c,,"The 'Test-NetConnection' cmdlet in Windows PowerShell is a tool that can be used to verify connectivity to a specific port on a host. It provides a variety of diagnostic tests for TCP/IP networks â€“ including testing for connectivity to a specific TCP port. While 'nc' (netcat) is a versatile networking tool that can also be used to test connectivity to a specific port, it is not specific to Windows OS and may not be included by default.

b. Windows 10
c. Windows 7
d. Linux
",,"a,d","a,d",,"Traceroute is a network diagnostic tool used to track the pathway that a packet of information takes from its source to its destination. On Mac OS and Linux operating systems, traceroute uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) packets to perform its task. It sends out UDP packets with a low TTL (Time-to-Live) value to cause routers along the path to the destination to respond with 'Time Exceeded' messages, which helps in identifying the route taken. In contrast, Windows operating systems typically use ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo requests for traceroute, which is known as 'tracert' in Windows.","['https://www.lifewire.com/traceroute-linux-command-4092586', 'https://www.computerhope.com/unix/utracero.htm', 'https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/networking/use-traceroute-command-line-tool']",1,google_6_troubleshooting_and_future_networking,0.95,0.9934074993307574

b. Division
c. Subtraction
d. Addition
",,c,c,,"During a traceroute operation, each router along the path to the destination decrements the Time To Live (TTL) field by one before forwarding the packet. If the TTL reaches zero, the router will not forward the packet and will typically send an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Time Exceeded message back to the sender. This decrementing process is effectively a subtraction operation.","['https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc792.txt', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceroute']",1,google_6_troubleshooting_and_future_networking,1,1.0
