32,What are some of the reasons that it is difficult to deploy improvements to BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. Changes are necessarily incremental because of the large installed base of routers that already run BGP.
b. BGP is implemented in hardware, so deploying changes to BGP requires changes on the timescale of hardware development cycles.
c. Deplyoing changes to BGP requires coordination across potentially tens of thousands of ASes in the Internet.
d. Only a few vendors implement BGP, and deploying changes requires convincing those vendors to change the protocol.
e. Deploying changes requires coordination in standards bodies such as the IETF.
",,"a,c,e","a,c,e",,"Deploying improvements to BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is challenging for several reasons. First, BGP has a large installed base of routers, and any changes must be incremental to avoid disrupting the existing infrastructure, hence option (a) is correct. Second, changes to BGP require coordination across a vast number of Autonomous Systems (ASes), which can be tens of thousands, making it a complex logistical challenge, so option (c) is correct. Lastly, BGP is a standardized protocol, and any changes to it require consensus and coordination within standards bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), making option (e) also correct. Options (b) and (d) are incorrect because BGP is not implemented in hardwareâ€”it is a control-plane protocol implemented in software, and there are more than a few vendors that implement BGP, so changes do not depend on convincing only a few vendors.","['https://www.ietf.org/', 'https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4271.html', 'Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach (7th Edition) by James Kurose and Keith Ross']",1,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.95,0.9056138012767094
33,Which of the following are true about the RCP? Select all that apply.,"a. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, the RCP controller for an AS sees all routes for all destinations that an AS learns from neighboring ASes.
b. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, there is no need for ASes to use BGP to exchange routes.
c. In an RCP deployment, routers no longer have to compute routes.
d. The RCP controller operates just like a route reflector would, selecting a single best route for each destination for all client routers.
e. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, a single AS can benefit from deploying RCP even if no other ASes deploy RCP.
",,"c,e","a,c,e",,"The Routing Control Platform (RCP) is a concept in the context of Software Defined Networking (SDN) that separates the control plane from the data plane. This allows for centralized control over routing decisions, which can be made by an RCP controller rather than individual routers. Here's a breakdown of the choices provided:

- a. True. In the initial phase of RCP deployment, the RCP controller for an Autonomous System (AS) does indeed see all routes for all destinations that the AS learns from neighboring ASes. This is because the RCP controller centralizes the control plane information.
- b. False. Even with RCP deployment, ASes still use BGP to exchange routes with each other. RCP does not replace BGP; it changes how BGP information is processed within an AS.
- c. True. With an RCP, routers no longer have to compute routes themselves because the RCP controller performs the route computation on behalf of the routers.
- d. False. The RCP controller does not operate exactly like a route reflector. While a route reflector selects a single best route for each destination, the RCP controller can potentially compute customized routes for different routers based on a wider set of policies and more comprehensive network information.
- e. True. A single AS can benefit from deploying RCP even if no other ASes do so because the RCP can optimize routing within the AS independently of other ASes.","['https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos561/papers/rcp.pdf', 'https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-rtgwg-rcp-01.txt']",0,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.95,0.9391769296583782

b. Implementing network-wide policy sometimes causes the routers themeselves to have to carry state.
c. Each router operates and makes decisions based only on a local view of network state.
d. BGP routing has a single point of failure.
e. It is not possible to perform traffic engineering with conventional BGP.
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"In the absence of a Routing Control Platform (RCP), traditional network management using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) has several characteristics and limitations. a. BGP does not have mechanisms to prevent forwarding loops in all cases; interactions with the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) can lead to situations where persistent forwarding loops occur. b. Implementing network-wide policies in BGP can result in routers having to maintain additional state information to enforce these policies. c. BGP routers make decisions based on their local view of the network, which is limited to the information received from directly connected neighbors and does not include a global view of the network state. d. BGP itself is a distributed protocol and does not have a single point of failure; however, the network can have single points of failure in other areas. e.

b. The second phase of RCP deployment offers potential benefits such as reduced routing table size.
c. In the second phase of deployment, the RCP controller sees all routes for every destination that neighboring ASes advertise.
d. The second phase of deployment requires fewer BGP sessions at the RCP controller than the first phase, thus improving scalability of the controller.
e. In the second phase of RCP deployment, ASes do not need to use BGP to exchange routes with one another.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"The second phase of RCP (Routing Control Platform) deployment typically involves the RCP controller having a more comprehensive view of the network. This means that the controller would see all routes for every destination that neighboring ASes (Autonomous Systems) advertise, which aligns with choice 'c'. Additionally, with the RCP taking on more responsibility for routing decisions, it could potentially lead to benefits such as reduced routing table size in individual routers, which aligns with choice 'b'. Choice 'a' is incorrect because the second phase may still require coordination with neighboring ASes to ensure proper routing and policy enforcement. Choice 'd' is not necessarily true, as the number of BGP sessions at the RCP controller would depend on the specific design and implementation and is not inherently fewer in the second phase. Choice 'e' is also incorrect, as ASes would still need to use BGP or another routing protocol to exchange routes, even if the RCP controller is managing the routing decisions.","['https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4271', -1.0]",1,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.85,0.93381817327446

Improved security (a) is a goal because a simpler control plane can be better understood, monitored, and protected.

Simpler management systems (c) are a result of a less complicated control plane, making it easier for network operators to manage the network. Faster innovation (d) is facilitated by a simpler control plane because it allows for quicker implementation and testing of new ideas.

Maintaining a single table in memory of AS paths that are learned across all BGP sessions in the AS, and using references into that table for specific routers (and routing decisions), to save memory.
b. If secure BGP were deployed, verifying the signatures on the AS paths of routes received from neighbors.

e. Performing inbound traffic engineering on a set of links in a coordinated fashion.
",,"a,b,c","a,c,d,e",,"The 4D architecture separates the decision logic from the protocols, which enables centralized computation and management. This can lead to more efficient use of resources. For example, maintaining a single table of AS paths (a) can save memory across the network because each router doesn't have to store its own copy. Keeping track of topology information (c) in a centralized manner allows for a global view of the network, which can be used for more efficient routing decisions. Performing route computation for all routers (d) in an autonomous system (AS) centrally can also lead to more optimized routes and save computation resources on individual routers. Lastly, performing inbound traffic engineering (e) in a coordinated fashion across multiple links can optimize traffic flow, which is more efficient than having individual routers make these decisions independently.
