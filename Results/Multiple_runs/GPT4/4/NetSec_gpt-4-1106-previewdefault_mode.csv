e. dynamic NAT
",,d,d,,"Policy NAT (also known as Policy-based NAT) allows the implementation of NAT rules based on certain criteria such as the source or destination address, or even based on specific types of traffic.

2,Which form of NAT uses port addresses to distinguish between translated sessions? Select one choice.,"a. static NAT
b. policy NAT
c. dynamic PAT
d. dynamic NAT
",,c,c,,"Port Address Translation (PAT), also known as NAT overload, uses port numbers to distinguish between different translated sessions. This allows multiple devices on a local network to be mapped to a single public IP address but with a unique port number for each session. Static NAT creates a one-to-one mapping between an internal and external IP address, which does not involve ports for session distinction. Dynamic NAT creates a one-to-one mapping between internal and external IP addresses from a pool of addresses, also without using port numbers to distinguish sessions. Policy NAT is used to implement NAT based on certain criteria or rules, which can involve both IP addresses and port numbers, but it is not specifically defined by the use of port addresses to distinguish sessions.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/network-address-translation-nat/4606-8.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation']",1,NetSec,0.95,0.9999994487765019

e. SMTP
",,d,d,,"DNS (Domain Name System) is known to be exploitable in amplification attacks due to its use of recursive lookups. Attackers can send small query packets to a DNS server with a spoofed source IP address (the victim's IP), and the server will send a much larger response to the victim's IP address. This can result in a significant amount of traffic being sent to the victim, overwhelming their network resources.","['https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-088A', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/dns-amplification-ddos-attack/']",1,NetSec,0.95,0.9999680987188567
33,Which type of attack forces a machine to respond to a SYN message by sending a packet to itself on the same port it received the SYN? Select one choice.,"a. Smurf
b. Land attack
c. Amplification attack
d. Reflection attack
",,b,b,,"A Land attack is a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack that sends a special crafted packet to a machine with the source IP address spoofed to be the same as the destination IP address and using the same source and destination ports. When the machine receives this packet, it tries to respond to itself, which can cause the system to crash or become unstable.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAND', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/land-attack']",1,NetSec,0.95,0.9999998063873687
34,A Layer 2 redirect or spoofing attack can be referred to as what type of attack? Select one choice.,"a. ARP attack
b. DHCP attack
c. NetBios attack
d. SSID attack
",,a,a,,"A Layer 2 redirect or spoofing attack is typically referred to as an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) attack. ARP is a protocol used for mapping an IP address to a physical machine address that is recognized in the local network. An ARP spoofing attack involves sending fake ARP messages over a local area network, which results in the linking of an attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network. This allows the attacker to intercept, modify, or stop data in transit.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/arp-spoofing.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing']",1,NetSec,0.95,0.9999932502087799
35,Which one of the following options is the illegitimate DHCP server that is referred to in the context of a DHCP server-based attack? Select one choice.,"a. A sitting duck server
b. A rogue DHCP server
c. A target server
d. An erroneous server
",,b,b,,"A rogue DHCP server refers to an unauthorized DHCP server on a network that is not under the administrative control of the network staff. This server can issue incorrect IP addresses or other network information, leading to denial of service or man-in-the-middle attacks. The term 'rogue' implies its illegitimate or malicious nature in the context of the network.",['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/dynamic-address-allocation-resolution/113336-rogue-dhcp.html'],1,NetSec,1,1.0
36,What is one way of mitigating DHCP attacks by using a Cisco switch? Select one choice.,"a. VLAN segmentation
b. MAC address security
c. DHCP snooping
d. DHCP authentication""
",,c,c,,"DHCP snooping is a security feature on switches that acts as a firewall between untrusted hosts and trusted DHCP servers. It does so by filtering out untrusted DHCP messages and by building and maintaining a DHCP snooping binding table. This table contains information about untrusted hosts with leased IP addresses, which helps prevent malicious activities such as DHCP spoofing attacks, where an attacker attempts to respond to DHCP requests with incorrect information.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12-2SX/configuration/guide/book/snoodhcp.html', 'https://www.networkstraining.com/dhcp-snooping/']",1,NetSec,0.95,0.9999996871837189
