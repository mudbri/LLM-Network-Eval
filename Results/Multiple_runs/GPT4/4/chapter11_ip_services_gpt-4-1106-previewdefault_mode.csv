You are responsible to find out why users are not being able to reach the Internet.","a. The cause is not related to dynamic NAT
b. The command output does not provide any clue to identify the problem
c. Dynamic NAT can't use Standard ACLs
d. The NAT pool does not have enough entries to fulfill the user's requests
",,d,d,,"The output indicates that the NAT pool 'examsdigest' has a total of 10 addresses available for NAT translation (from 190.1.1.1 to 190.1.1.10) and all of them are allocated (100%). Additionally, there are 595 misses, which suggests that there have been requests for NAT translation that could not be fulfilled because there were no available addresses left in the NAT pool. This is a clear indication that the NAT pool does not have enough entries to fulfill the user's requests, which is likely why users are not able to reach the Internet.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/network-address-translation-nat/4606-8.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipaddr_nat/configuration/xe-3s/nat-xe-3s-book/iadnat-addr-consv.html']",1,chapter11_ip_services,0.95,0.9999815683978641

b. show cdp
c. show running-config
d. show interface brief
",,b,c,,"The 'show running-config' command in Cisco IOS is used to display the current configuration of the router or switch, which includes all settings and configurations applied to the device. If Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is enabled globally, it will be visible in the running configuration. The other commands do not specifically provide information about the global status of CDP. 'show protocols' displays the status of configured Layer 3 protocols on the device, 'show cdp' provides information about the CDP settings but does not show whether it's enabled globally, and 'show interface brief' gives a brief overview of interface statuses and does not include CDP information.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/cdp/command/cdp-cr-book.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/m/en_us/techdoc/dc/reference/cli/nxos/commands/fund/show-running-config.html']",0,chapter11_ip_services,0.95,0.9969372659684211

Host A and host B attach to the same LAN and have correct default router settings per the FHRP configuration. Which of the following statements is true for this LAN?","a. You can't connect two routers to the same LAN subnet.
b. If one router fails, hosts can't send packets off-subnet

d. if one router fails, only one of the two hosts will still be able to send packets off-subnet
",,c,c,,"First Hop Redundancy Protocols (FHRPs) like HSRP, VRRP, or GLBP are designed to allow multiple routers to work together in a way that provides redundancy and failover capabilities. If one router fails, the other router takes over to continue routing traffic. In the scenario described, if one router fails, both hosts should automatically use the remaining router as their default gateway, assuming that the FHRP is configured correctly.
