91,You have noticed that a server with IP 145.45.3.2 doesn’t respond to requests. What command will you type first in order to test connectivity between your device and the server?,"a. request 145.45.3.2
b. check 145.45.3.2

In this case, 'ping 145.45.3.2' would be used to test connectivity to the server with the IP address 145.45.3.2.

92,"A LAN design uses a Layer 3 EtherChannel between two switches SW1 and SW2, with port-channel interface 1 used on both switches. SW1 uses ports G0/1 and G0/2 in the channel. However, only interface G0/1 is bundled into the channel and working. Think about the configuration settings on port G0/2 that could have existed before adding G0/2 to the EtherChannel. Which answers identify a setting that could prevent IOS from adding G0/2 to the Layer 3 EtherChannel? (Choose two answers.)","a. A different STP cost (spanning-tree cost value)
b. A different access VLAN (switchport access vlan vlanid)
c. A different speed (speed value)
d. A default setting for switchport (switchport)
",,"c,d","c,d",,"For EtherChannel to form correctly, all ports in the channel must have compatible settings. A difference in speed between the ports would prevent them from bundling into a single EtherChannel because the speed must be the same for all ports in the EtherChannel. Additionally, if one port is configured as a Layer 2 switchport and the other is not (i.e., it is configured as a Layer 3 port with an IP address), they cannot form an EtherChannel. The switchport command is used to configure the Layer 2 status of an interface, so a default setting for switchport on one port and not the other could prevent the EtherChannel from forming. STP cost and access VLAN differences do not directly prevent the formation of a Layer 3 EtherChannel since Layer 3 EtherChannels do not consider VLAN settings, and STP settings are irrelevant to Layer 3 port-channel interfaces.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-6500-series-switches/21066-135.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750x_3560x/software/release/15-0_2_se/configuration/guide/scg3750x/swethchl.html']",1,chapter5_ipv4_routing,0.95,0.6984837655714187
