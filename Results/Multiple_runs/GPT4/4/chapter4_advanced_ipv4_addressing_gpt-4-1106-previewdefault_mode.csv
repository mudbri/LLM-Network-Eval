",,"a,d","b,e",,"To support 90 subnets, you need to calculate the number of bits required to create at least 90 subnets. We can use the formula 2^n >= number of subnets, where n is the number of bits. In this case, we need to find the smallest n such that 2^n >= 90. The smallest n that satisfies this condition is 7 because 2^7 = 128, which is more than 90. A Class B network has a default subnet mask of /16. To add 7 more bits for subnetting, you would need a subnet mask of /16 + 7 = /23. However, the closest options provided are /21 and /19, which offer even more subnet bits than required. Option b, a /21 mask, provides 5 more bits than the default Class B mask (giving 2^5 = 32 subnets for each additional bit), and option e, 255.255.240.0, is equivalent to a /20 mask, which provides 4 more bits than the default Class B mask (giving 2^4 = 16 subnets for each additional bit). Both of these would suffice for creating 90 subnets.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html', 'https://www.ripe.net/about-us/press-centre/understanding-ip-addressing']",0,chapter4_advanced_ipv4_addressing,0.95,0.45654982464821287

In a Class A address, the default subnet mask is 255.0.0.0, which means by default, there are 8 network bits. However, the subnet mask given is 255.255.255.0, which is a subnetted mask. This means that the first three octets (255.255.255) are used for network and subnetting purposes, which totals 24 bits, and the last octet (0) is used for host addresses, which is 8 bits.
