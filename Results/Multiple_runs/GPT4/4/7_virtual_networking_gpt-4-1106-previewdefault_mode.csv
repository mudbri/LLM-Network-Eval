54,Which of the following properties are characteristics of virtual networks (but not necessarily characteristics of SDN). Select all that apply.,"a. Separates the data and control plane.
b. Refactors network control so that network behavior is controlled from a single logically centralized controller.
c. Separates logical and physical networks.
d. Often deployed in data center networks to allow multiple tenants to share physical network infrastructure.
e. Abstracts the details of the physical network.
",,"c,d,e","c,d,e",,"Virtual networks are often used to create logical separations on top of a physical network infrastructure. This allows for the creation of multiple, isolated networks that can operate independently of one another, which is especially useful in environments like data centers where resources are shared among multiple tenants. The characteristics of virtual networks include the separation of logical and physical networks (c), their common deployment in data center networks to allow for infrastructure sharing (d), and the abstraction of the physical network details from the users or tenants (e). While SDN also involves the separation of the control and data plane (a) and centralizes network control (b), these are not characteristics exclusive to virtual networks but are specific to the SDN architecture itself.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/what-is-sdn.html', 'https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/virtual-network.html']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.95,0.9997266176897558
55,Which of the following are possible ways of creating virtual links in a virtual network? Select all that apply.,"a. A wide-area tunnel, whereby an IP packet is encapsulated in an MPLS tunnel by attaching an MPLS header to the packet.
b. Longest-prefix match forwarding on an IP router.
c. A wide-area tunnel, whereby an Ethernet packet sent between two virtual machines is encapsulated in an IP packet.
d. VLAN switching based on a VLAN tag.
e. Pairs of virtual Ethernet interfaces, where one end of the Ethernet interface pair resides in the virtual environment, and the other resides in the root namespace on the host machine.
",,"a,c,d,e","a,c,d,e",,"Virtual links can be created in several ways in a virtual network environment. Here's how the provided options fit into this context:

a. A wide-area tunnel with MPLS encapsulation is a common method for creating virtual links over a wide area, as it allows for the creation of virtual paths across an MPLS network.

b. Longest-prefix match forwarding is a technique used by IP routers to determine the next hop for a packet. It is a fundamental part of IP routing but does not itself create a virtual link.

c. Encapsulating an Ethernet packet in an IP packet is a standard method for creating a tunnel, such as in a VPN, which can be used to form virtual links between two virtual machines over an IP network.

d. VLAN switching based on a VLAN tag is a method to create virtual links within a local area network. VLANs allow for the separation of broadcast domains in a layer 2 network and can be used to form virtual links between different network segments.

e. Pairs of virtual Ethernet interfaces can indeed be used to create virtual links, with one end of the pair in a virtual environment and the other in the root namespace of the host. This is a common practice in virtualized environments to link virtual machines to physical networks or other virtual machines.

Therefore, options a, c, d, and e are correct as they all describe methods of creating virtual links in a network.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotocol_Label_Switching', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_networking', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_prefix_match']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.95,0.9990661155411243
56,Which of the following are true of the Mininet network emulator? Select all that apply.,"a. It requires running OpenFlow-capable switches.
b. It is difficult to use it to route traffic for real services.
c. Mininet only allows users to create three types of topologies: linear, tree, and single-switch topologies.
d. It can create an emulation that runs across multiple physically distributed nodes.
e. All of the hosts in the topology must run the same underlying operating system.
",,"b,e","a,d",,"Mininet is a popular network emulator that allows the creation of a virtual network for development and testing purposes. It indeed requires OpenFlow-capable switches (a) because it is often used to emulate Software Defined Networks (SDNs) where OpenFlow is a commonly used protocol for communication between the control plane and the data plane. Mininet can also create an emulation that runs across multiple physically distributed nodes (d), which allows for scalability and more complex network emulation scenarios. It is not true that it is difficult to use Mininet to route traffic for real services (b); in fact, Mininet can be used to emulate real network scenarios and can route traffic accordingly. Mininet does not limit users to only three types of topologies (c); it is quite flexible and allows users to create custom topologies as needed. Lastly, while all the hosts in a Mininet topology run on the same physical machine, they are not required to run the same underlying operating system (e); they are lightweight virtual hosts that can run different processes as if they were on separate systems.","['http://mininet.org/', 'https://github.com/mininet/mininet', 'https://www.opennetworking.org/software-defined-standards/overview/']",0,7_virtual_networking,0.95,0.5785765661437272
57,"What are the benefits of emulation as opposed to, say, simulation? Select all that apply.","a. An emulation will complete faster than a simulation.
b. An emulator makes it possible to ""port"" experiments from one machine to another.
c. An emulator allows the experimenter run real software on each of the nodes in the emulation.
d. An emulation is easier to debug than a simulation.
e. Every run of the emulator will yield exactly the same results, resulting in reproducible experiments.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"An emulator allows for real software and systems to be tested in a controlled environment, which can include the actual code that would run on the physical devices. This is unlike a simulation, where models are used to represent the behavior of devices or networks. Emulation can be more detailed and accurate as it can run the actual software that would be used in a real-world scenario. This makes it possible to 'port' experiments from one machine to another (option b) because the same software environment can be replicated across different hardware. Moreover, an emulator allows the experimenter to run real software on each of the nodes within the emulation (option c), which is a significant advantage over simulation that typically uses abstract models rather than real software implementations. However, emulations do not necessarily complete faster than simulations (option a), are not inherently easier to debug (option d), and do not guarantee reproducible results (option e) because real-world complexities and non-deterministic factors can affect the outcome of an emulation.","['https://www.nsnam.org/overview/faq/#whats-the-difference-between-simulation-and-emulation', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_emulation']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.95,0.9998900706526737
58,Which of the following are possible in Mininet? Select all that apply.,"a. Measuring the latency between a host in San Francisco and a host in Los Angeles.
b. Assigning custom IP addresses to each node in the topology.
c. Assigning IP addresses to each node in the topology using a DHCP server.
d. Running performance measurement tools (e.g., iperf, wget) between nodes.
e. ""Shaping"" a link between two nodes to a particular traffic rate.
",,"b,c,d,e","b,d,e",,"Mininet is a network emulator that can create a virtual network on a single machine, and it allows various functionalities for educational and research purposes. While Mininet can emulate network topologies and conditions, it does not inherently measure real-world geographic latencies, so measuring the latency between a host in San Francisco and a host in Los Angeles (a) is not directly possible without additional real-world latency data. However, Mininet does allow for the following: b) Assigning custom IP addresses to each node in the topology is possible as Mininet allows for the configuration of network settings for each virtual node. d) Running performance measurement tools like iperf and wget between nodes is possible as Mininet supports the execution of network commands and tools within its emulated environment. e) Shaping a link between two nodes to a particular traffic rate is also possible as Mininet supports link bandwidth, delay, and loss configuration. c) While Mininet allows for the assignment of IP addresses, using a DHCP server is not a built-in feature and would require additional configuration or software to simulate such behavior.","['http://mininet.org/', 'http://mininet.org/walkthrough/', 'https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Introduction-to-Mininet']",0,7_virtual_networking,0.95,0.7754094259605496
59,Which of the following functions does FlowVisor enable? Select all that apply.,"a. Allowing two different researchers to implement and deploy different load balancing applications for all traffic between the same source-destination pair.
b. Allowing two controllers to control traffic on distinct VLANs.
c. Allowing two different researchers to implement and deploy different Web load balancing applications for port 80 traffic.
d. Allowing two different researchers to implement and deploy control mechanisms for two distinct applications.
e. Allowing one controller to control TCP traffic and one controller to control UDP traffic.
",,"b,d,e","b,d,e",,"FlowVisor is a special purpose OpenFlow controller that acts as a transparent proxy between OpenFlow switches and multiple OpenFlow controllers. It creates slices of network resources and delegates control of each slice to a different controller. This enables scenarios where different controllers manage traffic based on various criteria such as VLANs, ports, or traffic types. Therefore, FlowVisor can allow two controllers to control traffic on distinct VLANs (b), enable different researchers to deploy control mechanisms for distinct applications (d), and allow one controller to manage TCP traffic while another manages UDP traffic (e). It does not inherently focus on load balancing for a specific type of traffic such as Web load balancing for port 80 traffic (c) or for all traffic between the same source-destination pair (a) unless this is explicitly defined within the slicing criteria.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/cs-flowvisor.pdf', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915004115']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.95,0.5405965761057625

61,Select the statement that is most true about the relationship between network virtualization and SDNs.,"a. Network virtualization is a potential enabler for software-defined networks, since the separation of data and control planes first requires the creation of a logical network.
b. Software-defined networking is a potential enabler for virtual networks, since separation of data and control planes makes it easier to manage a logical network topology.
c. Network virtualization is a new concept introduced by Amazon, Nicira, and industry players; it only made sense to talk about network virtualization once central SDN controllers existed.
d. Network virtualization and software-defined networking each enable the other: SDN cannot exist without network virtualization, and network virtualization cannot exist without SDN.
",,b,b,,"Software-defined networking (SDN) is indeed a potential enabler for network virtualization. SDN separates the network's control plane (which makes decisions about where traffic is sent) from the data plane (which actually sends packets to the selected destination). This separation allows for more flexible management of network resources and facilitates the creation of virtual networks by simplifying the control over the network's behavior. Network virtualization can exist without SDN, as it has been used in technologies like VLANs and VPNs prior to the advent of SDN. Likewise, SDN concepts can be applied without implementing full network virtualization. Therefore, option 'b' is the most accurate statement regarding the relationship between the two.","['https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-the-definition-of-software-defined-networking-sdn/', 'https://www.networkworld.com/article/2287045/virtualization-what-is-network-virtualization-.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/what-is-sdn.html']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.95,0.9958880463284004
