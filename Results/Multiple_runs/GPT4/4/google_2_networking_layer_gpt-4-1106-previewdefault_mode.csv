c. 1 address
d. 16,777,216 addresses
",,b,b,,"A class C network is designated by a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. This means that the first three octets (24 bits) are used for network identification and the last octet (8 bits) is used for host identification. With 8 bits for host addresses, there are 2^8, or 256 possible addresses. However, one address is used for the network identifier and one is used for the broadcast address, leaving 254 usable IP addresses for hosts. But since the question asks for the total number of IP addresses, not just the usable ones, the correct answer is 256 addresses.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classful_network', 'https://www.ripe.net/about-us/press-centre/understanding-ip-addressing']",1,google_2_networking_layer,1,0.9999953958625991

b. Class B
c. Class E
d. Class A

b. service type field
c. fragmentation offset field
d. total length field
",,a,a,,"The flag field in the IP header is used to control or identify fragments. It includes bits that indicate whether a datagram can be fragmented and whether a datagram is the last fragment in a series. Specifically, one of the bits in the flag field is used to indicate if a datagram is allowed to be fragmented (the 'Don't Fragment' bit), and the fragmentation offset field is used to indicate the position of a fragment within the original datagram.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Flags', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc791']",1,google_2_networking_layer,1,0.9998878804318686

b. ARP
c. network
d. MAC addresses
",,c,c,,The IP address assigned to a device depends on the network to which it is connected. IP addresses are logically assigned to network interfaces based on the network's addressing scheme and subnetting.

",,c,c,,"CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation is a method for specifying IP addresses and their associated routing prefix. It appends a slash ('/') followed by the prefix length to the IP address. The prefix length represents the number of bits in the address that are fixed.

b. 3
c. 4
d. 2
",,c,c,,"A subnet mask is used in IP networking to designate which portion of an address refers to the network and which part refers to the host.

31,Which of the following are types of Interior Gateway Protocols? (Select all that apply),"a. Link State Routing Protocols
b. Distance-Vector Protocols
c. Hypertext Transfer Protocol
d. Transmission Control Protocol
",,"a,b","a,b",,"Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) are used to exchange routing information within a single autonomous system. There are two main types of IGPs: Link State Routing Protocols and Distance-Vector Protocols. Link State Routing Protocols, such as OSPF and IS-IS, work by having routers learn the entire network topology to compute the shortest path to each node. Distance-Vector Protocols, like RIP and EIGRP, work by having each router share its routing table with its immediate neighbors. On the other hand, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) are not routing protocols; HTTP is an application layer protocol used for transmitting web pages, and TCP is a transport layer protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of bytes between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_gateway_protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-state_routing_protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance-vector_routing_protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol']",1,google_2_networking_layer,1,1.0
