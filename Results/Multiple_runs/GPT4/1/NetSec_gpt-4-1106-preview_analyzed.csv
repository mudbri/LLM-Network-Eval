Dynamic PAT allows multiple devices on a local network to be mapped to a single public IP address but with a different port number for each session.

b. Fewest connections - Another common algorithm, this one sends new requests to the server with the fewest current connections, assuming servers with fewer active connections can handle new requests more efficiently.

c. Least time - This algorithm directs traffic to the server with the fastest response time and fewest active connections. It's a more dynamic approach that adapts to real-time server performance.

b. Packet sniffer
c. Ping sweeps
d. Port scans

a. Unplug network devices - This action would disrupt network services but would not gather any data for the attacker.

b. Packet sniffer - This is a passive reconnaissance tool that captures and analyzes network traffic. Attackers use packet sniffers to gather data such as unencrypted passwords, session tokens, and other sensitive information.

c. Ping sweeps - This is an active reconnaissance method where an attacker sends ICMP echo requests ('pings') to a range of IP addresses to identify which ones are active and potentially map out a network.

d. Port scans - Attackers perform port scans to detect open ports on network devices. This helps them to identify running services that could be exploited.

Unplugging network devices is not a method of gathering data but rather a form of physical disruption or denial of service.
