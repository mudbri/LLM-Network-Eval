b. Puppet
c. Chef
d. Ansible and Puppet
e. Puppet and Chef
",,a,a,,"Ansible is known for its agentless architecture, which means it does not require a software agent to be installed on the target nodes it manages. It uses SSH for communication with Linux hosts and WinRM for Windows hosts. Puppet and Chef, on the other hand, generally rely on an agent-based model where a software agent must be installed on each client machine that is being managed.","['https://www.ansible.com/overview/how-ansible-works', 'https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/architecture.html', 'https://docs.chef.io/chef_overview/']",1,chapter13_network_automation,0.95,0.999995395862599,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

b. Management plane
c. Control Plane
d. None of the above
",,a,a,,"A Layer 2 switch, when forwarding frames based on MAC addresses, operates in the data plane (also known as the forwarding plane). The data plane is responsible for the actual forwarding of packets/frames from one port to another within the network device, based on the information provided by the control plane. The management plane is involved in the configuration and management of the network device, and the control plane is where routing and switching decisions are made.
