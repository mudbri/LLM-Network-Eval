1,Which of the following terms describe Ethernet addresses that can send one frame and is delivered to multiple devices on the LAN? (Choose two answers.),"a. Broadcast address
b. Multicast address
c. IP address
d. MAC address
e. Unicast address
",,"a,b","a,b",,"In Ethernet networking, a broadcast address is used to send a frame to all devices on the local network segment. When a frame is sent to the broadcast address, all devices on the local area network (LAN) are intended to receive and process the frame. The broadcast address for Ethernet is all binary 1's, which is typically represented as FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF in hexadecimal notation. A multicast address is used to send a frame to a group of devices on the LAN that have been configured to listen for frames sent to that specific multicast address. Multicast addresses are a subset of the MAC address range that is reserved for multicast use. In contrast, unicast addresses (e) identify a single specific device, and IP addresses (c) and MAC addresses (d) are general terms that do not inherently imply frames being delivered to multiple devices.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_address', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_address', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/express-forwarding-cef/13749-12.html']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,0.95,0.999999255163977,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0

c. TCP/IP
d. TCP/UDP
",,a,a,,"CSMA/CD, which stands for Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection, is the set of rules used in networking to govern how devices on a network respond when a data collision occurs.

CSMA/CA, or Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance, is used in wireless networks to prevent collisions. TCP/IP and TCP/UDP are protocols used for different purposes: TCP/IP is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet, and TCP/UDP refers to Transmission Control Protocol and User Datagram Protocol, which are used for sending packets of data but do not handle collision scenarios.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-sense_multiple_access_with_collision_detection', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-sense_multiple_access_with_collision_avoidance', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,1.0,0.999999329572925,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0
