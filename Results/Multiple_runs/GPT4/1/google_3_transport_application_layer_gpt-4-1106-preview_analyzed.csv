36,What ordering of TCP flags make up the Three-Way Handshake?,"a. SYN, ACK, FIN
b. SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK
c. FIN, FIN/ACK, ACK
d. SYN, ACK, SYN, ACK
",,b,b,,"The Three-Way Handshake is a process used in TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) to establish a connection between a client and server. The correct sequence of flags used in this process is: 1) The client sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server to initiate a connection. 2) The server responds with a SYN/ACK (synchronize/acknowledge) packet to acknowledge receipt of the SYN and to send its own SYN. 3) The client sends an ACK (acknowledge) packet back to the server to acknowledge receipt of the server's SYN, completing the handshake. Therefore, the correct ordering of TCP flags for the Three-Way Handshake is SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-three-way-handshake/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Connection_establishment']",1,3_transport_application_layer,1,0.999999806387369,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

38,A device that blocks traffic that meets certain criteria is known as a ________.,"a. Hub
b. Router
c. Switch
d. Firewall
",,d,d,,"A firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies. At its most basic, a firewall is essentially the barrier that sits between a private internal network and the public Internet. Its main purpose is to block malicious traffic requests and data packets while allowing legitimate traffic through. Hubs, routers, and switches serve different purposes. A hub is a basic networking device that connects multiple computers or other network devices together. A router is used to connect multiple networks together and route traffic between them. A switch connects devices within a single network and uses MAC addresses to forward data to the correct destination. None of these devices have the primary function of blocking traffic based on certain criteria; that is the specific role of a firewall.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/firewalls/what-is-a-firewall.html', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-router/', 'https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/switch.htm', 'https://www.techopedia.com/definition/6306/hub-networking']",1,3_transport_application_layer,1,0.999999806387369,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
39,Which TCP flag is used to make the listening program respond immediately?,"a. ACK
b. PSH
c. URG
d. RST
",,b,b,,"The TCP flag that is used to make the listening program respond immediately is the PSH (Push) flag. When the PSH flag is set, it instructs the receiving host to push the data to the receiving application immediately without buffering it. This is used when the sender wants to ensure that the receiver processes the data as soon as possible. The ACK flag is used to acknowledge the receipt of packets. The URG flag indicates that there is urgent data that needs to be processed out of the usual sequence. The RST flag is used to reset the connection.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#TCP_segment_structure', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793']",1,3_transport_application_layer,1,0.999987886094374,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
40,_________are identified as ports 49152 through 65535.,"a. User ports
b. Ephemeral ports
c. Sockets
d. System ports
",,b,b,,"In the context of computer networking, ports are numbered endpoints for hosting specific network services. Port numbers are categorized into ranges based on their intended use. Ephemeral ports are temporary port numbers used by client systems when initiating a connection to a server, especially for the TCP and UDP protocols. They are typically assigned dynamically to client applications when the client system makes an outbound connection. According to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), the range for ephemeral ports is 49152 through 65535. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Ephemeral ports'.",['https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml'],1,3_transport_application_layer,1,0.999998852758658,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
41,"Unlike our five-layer model, the OSI network model adds two more layers on top of the Application Layer. Select examples of these new layers below.","a. The compression layer
b. The session layer
c. The interconnection layer
d. The presentation layer
",,"b,d","b,d",,"The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement standards for network communication. The OSI model has seven layers, two more than the five-layer model typically discussed in simplified networking contexts. The five-layer model generally includes the following layers: Application, Transport, Network, Data Link, and Physical. The OSI model includes all these layers but separates the Application layer into three distinct layers: the Application layer, the Presentation layer, and the Session layer. The Presentation layer (Layer 6) is responsible for the translation, encryption, and compression of data. The Session layer (Layer 5) manages sessions between communication systems, handling connection establishment, maintenance, and termination. The Compression layer and the Interconnection layer are not part of the OSI model.","['https://www.lifewire.com/layers-of-the-osi-model-illustrated-818017', 'https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/osi-model']",1,3_transport_application_layer,1,0.999999210369312,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
42,An example of something that operates at the application layer is:,"a. UDP
b. A router
c. TCP
d. A web browser
",,d,d,,"The application layer in the OSI model is where end-user software operates. It is responsible for handling high-level protocols, representation, encoding, and dialog control. Here's the breakdown of the choices in relation to the OSI model layers:

a. UDP (User Datagram Protocol) operates at the transport layer, which is responsible for host-to-host communication.
b. A router operates at the network layer, which is responsible for path determination and logical addressing.
c. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) also operates at the transport layer, providing reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of bytes.
d. A web browser operates at the application layer, as it is an end-user software that allows users to access, navigate, and transmit data over the Internet.

Therefore, the correct answer is 'd', a web browser, since it is an application that users interact with directly to perform networked tasks.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer']",1,3_transport_application_layer,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
44,Which part of the operating system does the application use to communicate the need to establish a TCP connection?,"a. Networking stack
b. ARP message
c. The source port
d. The router
",,a,a,,"The networking stack, also known as the network stack or TCP/IP stack, is the part of the operating system that provides networking functionality. It is a suite of protocols that work together to manage network communications. When an application needs to establish a TCP connection, it makes a request to the networking stack, which then initiates the connection process according to the TCP protocol. The networking stack handles the details of the TCP handshake, data transmission, and connection termination. The other options are not directly related to the operating system's role in establishing a TCP connection.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite', 'https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=stacks-tcpip-protocol-stack']",1,3_transport_application_layer,0.95,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
45,Which of the following sections of the TCP/IP Five-Layer Network Model contain the data the application wants to send? Select all that apply.,"a. The payload section of the Ethernet frame
b. The payload section of the IP Datagram
c. The payload of the TCP segment
d. The header of the Ethernet frame
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"In the TCP/IP Five-Layer Network Model, the data an application wants to send is encapsulated within the payload sections of various protocol data units (PDUs) as it moves down the layers. Here's the breakdown of each choice:

a. The payload section of the Ethernet frame - This is correct. At the Link Layer, the Ethernet frame encapsulates the IP datagram, which includes the original data, within its payload.

b. The payload section of the IP Datagram - This is correct. At the Internet Layer, the IP datagram includes the TCP segment (or other transport layer protocol data unit) as its payload, which in turn contains the application's data.

c. The payload of the TCP segment - This is correct. At the Transport Layer, the TCP segment's payload is the actual data that the application wants to send.

d. The header of the Ethernet frame - This is incorrect. The header of the Ethernet frame (or any header in general) contains control information, not the application's data. The headers are used to help deliver the payload (which contains the data) to the correct destination.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_datagram', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol']",1,3_transport_application_layer,1,0.999858366465976,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
