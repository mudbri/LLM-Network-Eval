62,Which of the following are true of “network slicing”? Select all that apply.,"a. Network operators can use slicing to test configurations on “shadow” networks that mirror a production network topology.
b. One way to slice networks is according to “flow space”, whereby different controllers might control distinct and non-overlapping traffic flows.
c. A controller can prevent one network slice from interfering with the resources of another.
d. Multi-tenant datacenters are one use case for network slicing.
e. Conventional (i.e., non-SDN) networks have no concept of network virtualization or slicing.
",,"a,b,d","a,b,c,d",,"Network slicing is a concept that allows multiple virtual networks to be created on top of a shared physical infrastructure. It is commonly associated with Software Defined Networking (SDN) and is instrumental in creating separate logical networks for different purposes or tenants. Here's an evaluation of each choice provided in the question:

a. Network operators can indeed use slicing to create 'shadow' networks for testing purposes, which is a safe way to test configurations without affecting the production network.

b. Slicing a network according to 'flow space' is a valid approach in SDN, where different traffic flows can be managed by different controllers, ensuring that each slice handles distinct and non-overlapping traffic flows.

c. Controllers in SDN environments are designed to manage network resources. They can enforce policies that prevent one network slice from interfering with or consuming the resources allocated to another slice, ensuring isolation among slices.

d. Multi-tenant datacenters can benefit from network slicing, as it allows each tenant to have a separate logical network, providing security and customization for their specific needs.

e. The statement that conventional networks have no concept of network virtualization or slicing is incorrect. Traditional networks can implement virtualization techniques such as VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) and VPNs (Virtual Private Networks), which are forms of network slicing or virtualization. These techniques allow for the creation of separate logical networks over a shared physical infrastructure.

b. One host could send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces.
c. Flow spaces can only be defined according to combinations of packet header fields.
d. Flowspace isolation separates individual virtual networks from one another but incurs some performance penalty for doing so.

64,Which of the following describe the control-plane checks that FlowVisor implements? Select all that apply.,"a. When a packet must be forwarded to a controller, Flowvisor forwards traffic to the correct controller based on which controller “owns” the flowspace corresponding to that packet.
b. Flowvisor prevents each slice's controller from being the target of a denial of service attack from other slices.
c. Flowvisor can only instantiate network slices based on the network topology, not based on other properties, such as application traffic.

e. Flowvisor installs traffic shaping and quality of service rules to ensure that each network slice has guaranteed resources.

It creates network slices, each controlled by a different controller, to enable virtualization in Software Defined Networks (SDN). Here's the evaluation of each choice:

a. Correct. FlowVisor does indeed forward traffic to the appropriate controller based on the flowspace rules it has defined. Each controller 'owns' a portion of the flowspace, and FlowVisor ensures that packets are forwarded to the controller responsible for that particular flowspace.

b. Incorrect. While FlowVisor does isolate the control logic of different slices, preventing direct interference between slices, it does not inherently prevent denial of service attacks targeted at a controller. Controllers must implement their own security measures to handle such attacks.

c. Incorrect. FlowVisor can instantiate network slices based on various properties, not just the network topology. These properties can include application traffic, VLAN tags, MAC addresses, and more.

d. Correct. One of the key functions of FlowVisor is to enforce isolation between slices by ensuring that a controller cannot write data-plane rules for a part of the flowspace that it does not have rights to. This prevents controllers from affecting traffic in slices they do not own.

e. Incorrect. While FlowVisor does enforce isolation and can limit the resources each slice can use, it does not install traffic shaping and quality of service rules itself.

a. Quality of service for certain applications (e.g., video streaming): Network slicing can ensure that certain applications, like video streaming, have the necessary bandwidth and low latency to function effectively.

c. Smart grid applications: Network slices can be dedicated to smart grid applications, which require reliable and secure communication channels for managing energy distribution.

e. Guest WiFi access: A separate network slice can be allocated for guest WiFi access, ensuring that guests have internet access without compromising the security or performance of the primary home network.

b. Traceback of attack traffic to its source: While network slicing could potentially be used in conjunction with security measures, traceback of attack traffic is more of a security function than an application of network slicing itself.

d. Load balance of inbound traffic: Load balancing is a technique used to distribute workloads across multiple computing resources.

b. SDN predates network virtualization
c. Network virtualization requires SDN
d. SDN makes some aspects of network virtualization easier to manage
e. Network virtualization enables SDN
",,"a,d","a,d",,"SDN (Software Defined Networking) and network virtualization are closely related concepts in the field of computer networking, but they are not the same thing. SDN refers to the approach of managing network services through abstraction of lower-level functionality, which is done by decoupling the control plane from the data plane. This allows for more flexible network management and configuration. Network virtualization, on the other hand, involves creating a virtual version of network resources (such as switches, routers, firewalls, etc.), often to improve resource utilization and provide network services that are abstracted from the underlying hardware. SDN controllers can indeed help manage network configurations (option a), and they can make aspects of network virtualization easier to manage by providing centralized control and automation capabilities (option d). However, it is not accurate to say that SDN predates network virtualization (option b) or that network virtualization requires SDN (option c) as network virtualization can be achieved using other methods as well. Lastly, network virtualization does not enable SDN (option e); rather, it is one of the technologies that can be enhanced by the implementation of SDN.","['https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/software-defined-networking', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/virtualization/definitions/what-is-network-virtualization/']",1,8_data_center_virtualization,0.95,0.988602102467028,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0

","NVP, which stands for Network Virtualization Platform, is designed to allow tenants to create and manage their own virtual networks. Here's an analysis of each option:

a. True. NVP allows tenants to configure logical datapaths on their own virtual hosts. Tenants can create isolated networks with their own topologies and policies.

b. False. NVP typically does not rely on switches with custom hardware. It is designed to work with standard, off-the-shelf hardware and leverages software for network virtualization.

c. True. NVP allows tenants to configure switches in the middle of the network for portions of flowspace that they own. This is part of the flexibility provided by network virtualization platforms, allowing tenants to define network behavior.

d. False. While NVP can use user space for some processing, this statement is too absolute as it does not always require exact matches to be performed in user space. Network functions can be offloaded to kernel space or even to hardware for better performance.

e. True. In NVP, most of the 'intelligence' for datapath processing lies in virtual hosts, not in switches.
