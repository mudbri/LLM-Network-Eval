36,An IP address associated with a mobile node while visiting a foreign link is called:,"a. Care of address
b. Home link
c. Handover address
d. Home address
",,a,a,,"When a mobile node is visiting a foreign network, it is assigned a temporary IP address on that network, which is known as the 'Care of address'. This address is used to forward the packets to the mobile node while it is away from its home network. The 'Home address' is the permanent IP address assigned to the mobile node in its home network. 'Home link' is a term that refers to the home network to which a mobile node is permanently assigned, but it is not an IP address. 'Handover address' is not a standard term used in the context of IP addressing for mobile nodes.","['https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3344.txt', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_IP']",1,TCP,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The attack involves an attacker sending a succession of SYN requests to a target's system in an attempt to consume enough server resources to make the system unresponsive to legitimate traffic. This is done by not completing the third part of the handshake (not sending the ACK), leaving connections half-open and eventually exhausting resources.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/syn-flood-ddos-attack/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood']",1,TCP,1.0,0.999999806387369,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
