It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Here's the breakdown of the given options:

a. Easier for humans to remember website names: This is true. DNS translates human-readable domain names like 'www.example.com' into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network. It's much easier for humans to remember words than numerical IP addresses.

b. Easy for the node to find the network ID: This is not a primary benefit of DNS. DNS is not directly involved in finding network IDs; rather, it resolves domain names to IP addresses. Network IDs are part of an IP address and are used for routing traffic on a network, which is a separate function from DNS.

c. Allows administrative changes to happen seamlessly: True. When a domain's IP address changes, the change is made in the DNS records. Users continue to use the same domain name and are automatically directed to the new IP address, making the transition seamless.

d. Small routing tables: DNS does not affect the size of routing tables.
