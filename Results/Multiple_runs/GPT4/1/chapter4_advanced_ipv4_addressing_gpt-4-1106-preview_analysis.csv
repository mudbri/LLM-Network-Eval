To support 90 subnets, we need to determine how many bits are required to represent at least 90 unique values. Using the formula 2^n >= number of subnets (where n is the number of bits), we find that 2^7 = 128, which is the smallest power of 2 greater than 90. Therefore, we need 7 additional bits for subnetting. Adding these 7 bits to the original 16 bits of the Class B network, we get a subnet mask of /23 (16+7=23). However, since the question asks for a mask that can support at least 90 subnets, we can use a /21 or a /22 subnet mask, which provides even more subnets. The corresponding decimal subnet masks for /21 and /22 are 255.255.248.0 and 255.255.240.0, respectively. Option b (/21) and option e (255.255.240.0) are therefore correct. Option d (255.255.255.252) is a /30 mask which is typically used for point-to-point links, and option f (255.255.224.0) is a /19 mask which provides more subnets than required.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html', 'https://www.ripe.net/about-us/press-centre/understanding-ip-addressing']",0,chapter4_advanced_ipv4_addressing,0.95,0.583704562667878,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,Reached the correct answer but got confused midway?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,Incorrect reasoning/deduction,Contradictory reasoning,,,1.0,2.0,"trusted article, documentation",2.0,First link seems to imply that 128 addresses are /25 or less - which might cause the problem,0.0,1.0,"Might provision less than required.
