b. Ethernet
c. UDP
d. TCP
",,a,a,,"In the five-layer TCP/IP model, the network layer, also known as layer 3, is responsible for packet forwarding including routing through intermediate routers. The Internet Protocol (IP) is the principal protocol in the network layer and is responsible for delivering packets from the source host to the destination host based on their addresses. Here's an evaluation of each choice:

a. IP - Correct. IP is a network layer protocol used for routing and addressing packets of data.
b. Ethernet - Incorrect. Ethernet is a technology for LANs and is associated with the data link layer (layer 2) in the TCP/IP model.

c. Full duplex is a form of simplex communications.
d. Full duplex is slower than half duplex.
",,b,b,,"Full duplex and half duplex refer to the ability of a communication channel to send and receive data. Full duplex allows for communication in both directions simultaneously, meaning data can be sent and received at the same time. This is commonly used in modern Ethernet networks with switches. On the other hand, half duplex means that the channel can either send or receive data at one time, but not both simultaneously. This is seen in older networks or in walkie-talkie type communication systems. Option 'a' is misleading because the use of hubs or switches doesn't solely determine duplex mode; it's possible for both devices to support either mode depending on their design and configuration. Option 'c' is incorrect because simplex communications involve sending signals in only one direction, which is different from both full and half duplex. Option 'd' is incorrect because full duplex can be faster than half duplex since it allows simultaneous two-way communication, doubling the potential throughput.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_(telecommunications)', 'https://www.diffen.com/difference/Full_Duplex_vs_Half_Duplex']",1,1_basics_computer_networking,0.95,0.999993727020075,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0
