54,Which of the following properties are characteristics of virtual networks (but not necessarily characteristics of SDN). (Be careful: The distinctions between SDN and virtual networks were discussed in the first lesson of this module.) Select all that apply.,"a. Separates the data and control plane.
b. Refactors network control so that network behavior is controlled from a single logically centralized controller.
c. Separates logical and physical networks.
d. Often deployed in data center networks to allow multiple tenants to share physical network infrastructure.
e. Abstracts the details of the physical network.
",,"c,d,e","c,d,e",,"Virtual networks and Software Defined Networking (SDN) share some similarities but also have distinct characteristics. Here's an evaluation of each choice in relation to virtual networks:

a. 'Separates the data and control plane.' - This is a characteristic of SDN, not necessarily of virtual networks. SDN specifically decouples the network's control logic from the underlying routers and switches, enabling network control to become directly programmable.

b. 'Refactors network control so that network behavior is controlled from a single logically centralized controller.' - This is another defining characteristic of SDN rather than virtual networks. While some virtual network solutions might utilize a centralized controller, it is not a defining characteristic of virtual networks as a whole.

c. 'Separates logical and physical networks.' - Virtual networks indeed separate logical networks from the physical infrastructure, allowing multiple virtual networks to run on the same physical hardware.

d. 'Often deployed in data center networks to allow multiple tenants to share physical network infrastructure.' - This is a characteristic of virtual networks, particularly in the context of cloud computing and multi-tenant data centers, where they enable isolation and multi-tenancy.

e. 'Abstracts the details of the physical network.' - Virtual networks abstract the complexity and details of the physical network from the user or administrator, which is a core characteristic of virtual networking but not exclusive to SDN.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/software-defined-networking/index.html', 'https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/virtual-networking.html', 'https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/software-defined-networking-SDN']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.95,0.999938984767855,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0

b. Longest-prefix match forwarding on an IP router.
c. A wide-area tunnel, whereby an Ethernet packet sent between two virtual machines is encapsulated in an IP packet.

a. A wide-area tunnel with MPLS encapsulation is a common method used in virtual networks to create virtual links over a physical network, making it a correct choice.

b. Longest-prefix match forwarding is a technique used by IP routers to determine the best matching prefix for a given IP address in the routing table. This is not a method of creating virtual links but rather a routing decision process.

c. Encapsulating an Ethernet packet in an IP packet is typical in creating virtual links, such as in the case of a VPN or GRE tunnel. This choice is correct.

d. VLAN switching based on a VLAN tag is a method used to segregate network traffic within the same physical network, effectively creating virtual links or networks, so this choice is also correct.

a. True. Mininet typically uses Open vSwitch, which is an open-source implementation of a distributed virtual multilayer switch, and it is OpenFlow-capable. This is one of the key features that allows Mininet to emulate Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environments.

b. False. Mininet can be quite flexible and it is possible to use it to route traffic for real services, although with some limitations due to it being an emulator running on a single system.

c. False. Mininet allows users to create various types of topologies beyond just linear, tree, or single-switch. Users can create custom topologies as well.

d. True. While Mininet is typically used on a single system, it can be extended to run across multiple nodes using clustering techniques, although this is more complex and not the primary use case.

b. An emulator makes it possible to ""port"" experiments from one machine to another.
c. An emulator allows the experimenter run real software on each of the nodes in the emulation.
d. An emulation is easier to debug than a simulation.
e. Every run of the emulator will yield exactly the same results, resulting in reproducible experiments.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"Emulation and simulation are both useful techniques for modeling systems, but they have distinct characteristics and benefits. Here's how each option relates to the benefits of emulation over simulation:

a. An emulation will complete faster than a simulation. - This statement is not necessarily true. The speed of completion depends on various factors, including the complexity of the system being emulated or simulated and the level of detail. Emulation can sometimes be slower than simulation because it often involves running actual software on virtualized hardware.

b. An emulator makes it possible to 'port' experiments from one machine to another. - This is true. Since an emulator replicates the behavior of a particular hardware or software environment, it can be transferred or 'ported' between different machines without needing the specific hardware being emulated.

c. An emulator allows the experimenter to run real software on each of the nodes in the emulation. - This is one of the key benefits of emulation. It enables the running of real-world software and systems within the emulated environment, which can be critical for accurate testing and analysis.

d. An emulation is easier to debug than a simulation. - This is not necessarily true. Debugging can be more or less challenging in either case, depending on the specifics of what is being debugged and the tools available.

e. Every run of the emulator will yield exactly the same results, resulting in reproducible experiments. - This is not a benefit exclusive to emulation. Both emulated and simulated environments can be designed to be deterministic or non-deterministic. However, because emulators often involve real-world software and hardware interactions, they may introduce non-deterministic behavior, making this statement generally false for emulation.

a. Measuring the latency between a host in San Francisco and a host in Los Angeles is not possible in Mininet as it does not emulate the actual geographical distances or the real-world physical infrastructure that would impact latency over such distances.

b. Assigning custom IP addresses to each node in the topology is possible in Mininet. You can specify the IP addresses for each host or switch when you define the topology.

c. While Mininet allows you to assign IP addresses manually, it does not support the use of a DHCP server out of the box. However, it might be possible to run a DHCP server on one of the emulated hosts, but this is not a standard feature of Mininet.

a. This choice is incorrect because FlowVisor does not inherently enable two different researchers to deploy different load balancing applications for all traffic between the same source-destination pair. Load balancing typically would be managed within a single slice, not across multiple slices for the same traffic.

b. This is correct because FlowVisor can allow two controllers to control traffic on distinct VLANs, effectively slicing the network by VLANs.

c. This is correct as FlowVisor can slice the network by port numbers, allowing different researchers to implement and deploy different Web load balancing applications for port 80 traffic.

d. This is correct because FlowVisor enables different slices to be created for different applications, allowing researchers to implement and deploy control mechanisms for each application within its slice.

b. Software-defined networking is a potential enabler for virtual networks, since separation of data and control planes makes it easier to manage a logical network topology.
c. Network virtualization is a new concept introduced by Amazon, Nicira, and industry players; it only made sense to talk about network virtualization once central SDN controllers existed.
d. Network virtualization and software-defined networking each enable the other: SDN cannot exist without network virtualization, and network virtualization cannot exist without SDN.
",,b,b,,"Software-defined networking (SDN) is an approach to networking that uses software-based controllers or application programming interfaces (APIs) to direct traffic on the network and communicate with the underlying hardware infrastructure. This separation of the control plane (which makes decisions about where traffic should be sent) from the data plane (which actually sends packets to the selected destination) is a fundamental principle of SDN. This separation makes it easier to manage and configure network devices programmatically and dynamically, which is a key enabler for creating virtual networks. Virtual networks can be easily shaped, managed, and manipulated using the SDN paradigm, making SDN a potential enabler for network virtualization. Network virtualization itself predates SDN and does not inherently require SDN to exist; it can be achieved through other means as well.
