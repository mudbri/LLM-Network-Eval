Additionally, there are 'misses' reported, which signifies that there have been 595 instances where an internal device tried to access an external network but could not be allocated an address from the NAT pool because the pool is fully utilized.

",,a,a,,"NTP, which stands for Network Time Protocol, is used to synchronize the clocks of computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks. It is designed to synchronize the time of systems to within a few milliseconds of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). SMTP is the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, used for email transmission. UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol, which is a communication protocol used across the Internet for especially time-sensitive transmissions such as video playback or DNS lookups, but it does not synchronize time.
