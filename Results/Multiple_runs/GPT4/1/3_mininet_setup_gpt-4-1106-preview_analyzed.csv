16,Which of the following command is used to generate an OpenFlow network topology consisting of a single switch and 8 hosts with randomly generated MAC addresses for each host?,"a. sudo mn --topo single,8  --switch ovsk --controller remote
b. sudo mn --topo single,3 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
c. sudo mn --topo single,8 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
d. sudo mn --topo linear,8  --switch ovsk --controller remote",,a,c,,"The Mininet command 'sudo mn' is used to create a network topology in a Software Defined Networking (SDN) environment. The '--topo' flag specifies the topology type and the number of nodes. The 'single,8' argument indicates a single switch connected to 8 hosts. The '--mac' flag is used to automatically assign MAC addresses to the hosts. The '--switch ovsk' specifies the use of the Open vSwitch kernel switch, and '--controller remote' indicates that the switch should connect to a remote controller. Therefore, the command that generates an OpenFlow network topology with a single switch and 8 hosts, each with a randomly generated MAC address, is 'sudo mn --topo single,8 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote'.","['http://mininet.org/', 'http://mininet.org/walkthrough/']",0,3_mininet_setup,1.0,0.999999687183719,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,"Doesn’t know that —Mac is used for sequential generation of Mac addresses, not random",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0.0,2.0,"documentation, documentation",2.0,,1.0,1.0,Wrong command can lead to debugging delay,0.0,mininet,"misinformation, debugging delay",Minor,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,0
17,What is the purpose of --mac flag used in mininet?,"a. Generates random MAC addresses for the hosts.
b. Generates sequential MAC addresses for the hosts, matching their IP address.
c. Generates sequential MAC addresses for the switch ports, matching their IP address.
d. Generates random MAC addresses for the switch ports.
",,b,b,,"The --mac flag in Mininet is used to generate MAC addresses for the hosts that are sequential and correspond to their IP addresses. This simplifies the process of identifying hosts in a network because their MAC addresses are predictable and structured in a way that relates to their IP addresses. It does not generate random MAC addresses nor does it apply to switch ports, which are not typically assigned IP addresses in the same manner as hosts.","['http://mininet.org/walkthrough/', 'https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Introduction-to-Mininet']",1,3_mininet_setup,0.95,0.984618016038928,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
20,"What is the purpose of dpctl, provided with mininet?","a. To enable visibility and control over a single switch’s flow table.
b. To enable visibility and control over multiple switch flow table.
c. Is an OpenFlow controller.
",,a,a,,"dpctl is a command-line utility that is used to interact with OpenFlow switches. It is provided with Mininet, which is a network emulator. The primary purpose of dpctl is to enable visibility and control over a single switch's flow table. It allows users to add, delete, and modify flow entries in the flow table of the switch, which is essential for managing how the switch handles packets. It does not inherently provide visibility or control over multiple switch flow tables simultaneously, nor is it an OpenFlow controller itself; controllers are separate entities that manage multiple switches in an SDN environment.","['https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Introduction-to-Mininet#using', 'https://www.opennetworking.org/software-defined-standards/specifications/']",1,3_mininet_setup,0.95,0.999616113973104,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
