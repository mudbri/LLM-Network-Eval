There are two main types of IGPs: Link State Routing Protocols and Distance-Vector Protocols.

Distance-Vector Protocols, like RIP (Routing Information Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol), work by having each router inform its neighbors of its routing table. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) are not routing protocols; HTTP is an application layer protocol used for transmitting web pages, and TCP is a transport layer protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of bytes between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_gateway_protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-state_routing_protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance-vector_routing_protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol']",1,2_networking_layer,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
