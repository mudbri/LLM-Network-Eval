204,"The customer edge device is typically a router, that sits at a customer site on MPLS networks and connects to a provider edge router (PE router) to take communications from a customer site to a provider side.","a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",,a,a,,"The statement is true. In MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching) networks, the customer edge (CE) device is typically a router located at the customer's premises. It connects to the provider edge (PE) router, which is part of the service provider's network.

b. Star
c. Hybrid
d. Partial Mesh
",,a,a,,"A full mesh network design is one where each node in the network has a direct link to every other node. This type of network provides the highest level of redundancy, as there is a direct path between any two nodes, but it can be expensive and complex to implement due to the large number of links required. In contrast, a star network centers around a central hub, a hybrid network combines elements of different topologies, and a partial mesh has some nodes connected directly and others indirectly.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/network-management/network-management-concepts/200465-Network-Design-Considerations-for-a-Mesh.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking']",1,chapter12_network_design_architecture,1,0.9999998063873687

211,Your company plans to start using public cloud service and now you are considering different WAN options. Your main concern is security by keeping the data private while also providing good QoS services. Which of the following options are under consideration? (Choose two answers.),"a. Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider
b. Using an Internet connection without VPN
c. Using an Internet connection with VPN
d. Using an intercloud exchange
",,"a,d","a,c",,"When considering WAN options for connecting to a public cloud service with a focus on security and QoS, the following options are viable: a) Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider ensures that the data remains private as it does not traverse the public internet. This also allows for better QoS since the connection is dedicated and can be managed end-to-end. c) Using an Internet connection with VPN also provides security by encrypting the data as it traverses the public internet, ensuring privacy. The QoS might not be as good as a private WAN connection due to the nature of the public internet, but it is still a secure option.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/what-is-sd-wan.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/vpn-endpoint-security-clients/what-is-vpn.html']",0,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,0.9999967518919751

The enterprise uses OSPF at all sites, with one router connected to the service from each site. Which of the following are true about the Layer 3 details most likely used with this service and design? (Choose all that apply)","a. The WAN uses one IP subnet
b. The WAN uses 20 or more IP subnets
c. A remote site router would have one OSPF neighbor
d. A remote site router would have 20 OSPF neighbors
",,"a,d","a,c",,"In a Metro Ethernet E-LAN service, all sites appear to be on the same Ethernet network, making it possible to use a single IP subnet across the WAN. This is because an E-LAN service emulates a LAN over a wide area, allowing all connected sites to communicate as if they were on the same local network. Consequently, each remote site router would logically see only one OSPF neighbor, which is the router at the headquarters. The routers do not form OSPF adjacencies with the other remote site routers directly across the E-LAN service.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Enterprise/WAN_and_MAN/MetroEthernet.html', 'https://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=680824&seqNum=2']",0,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.9,0.9846165635019638
