b. Processing packets at higher rates.
c. A wider range of packet processing primitives.
d. Flexible match-action tables, such as the ability to compose multiple match-action tables in sequence or in parallel.

",,"c,d,e","a,b,c,d,e",,"The desired features in future SDN switches that motivate a programmable data plane include a variety of aspects aimed at improving performance, flexibility, and efficiency. Reducing energy consumption for custom packet processing (a) is important as networks seek to become more environmentally friendly and cost-efficient. Processing packets at higher rates (b) is a constant goal to keep up with increasing bandwidth demands. A wider range of packet processing primitives (c) allows for more sophisticated and customized network functions. Flexible match-action tables (d), such as the ability to compose them in sequence or parallel, provide the versatility needed for complex policy enforcement and traffic management. Lastly, a configurable packet parser that is not tied to a specific header format (e) is crucial for supporting a wide range of protocols, including emerging and custom ones, without hardware changes.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/software-defined-standards/overview/', 'https://www.ietf.org/blog/sdn-programmability/']",0,11_protocol_independent_forwarding,0.95,0.8591331511553801
79,Which of the following best describes protocol independence?,"a. The ability to configure a packet parser in hardware that is agnostic to (and not constrained by) the control protocol.
b. The ability to evolve an existing control protocol without breaking interoperability.
c. The ability to run a switch independently from the controller.
d. The ability to support multiple protocols running in parallel on the same hardware.
e. The ability to run a network with both legacy OpenFlow switches and switches that support custom packet processing.
",,a,"a,d",,"Protocol independence refers to the capability of network devices or systems to operate without being tied to a specific set of protocols. Option 'a' correctly describes protocol independence as it refers to a packet parser in hardware that is not constrained by a specific control protocol, meaning it can understand and process various types of protocol headers. Option 'd' is also correct because protocol independence includes the ability to support multiple protocols running in parallel on the same hardware, which implies that the system is not limited to a single protocol. Option 'b' is about the evolution of a protocol, which does not necessarily imply protocol independence. Option 'c' refers to the independence of a switch from the controller, which is more about the autonomy of the device rather than protocol independence. Option 'e' involves running a network with different types of switches, which touches on interoperability and legacy support rather than the concept of protocol independence itself.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/software-defined-standards/overview/', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-the-definition-of-software-defined-networking-sdn/']",0,11_protocol_independent_forwarding,0.95,0.8546917084332669
81,Which of the following describe functions of the P4 parser? Select all that apply.,"a. Constructing a graph of dependencies between different logical tables.
b. Translating rules to physical tables.
c. Verifying that the description of packet parsing is consistent with the behavior of an existing hardware switch (e.g., a legacy OpenFlow switch).
d. Translating a packet processing specification to a state machine.
e. Mapping logical tables to underlying switch resources.
",,"c,d","a,d",,"The P4 parser is a component of the P4 programming language, which is used to describe how packets are processed by the data plane of a network switch or router. The parser's role is to interpret the packet headers and determine how to process the packet through the pipeline. Specifically, it does the following:

a. Constructing a graph of dependencies between different logical tables: The P4 parser helps in defining the relationships between the headers and the logical tables that will process them, essentially constructing a parse graph that determines the order in which headers are extracted and processed.

b. Translating rules to physical tables: This is typically not the function of the parser itself but of the control plane, which translates high-level policies into specific rules that are installed in the physical tables.

c. Verifying that the description of packet parsing is consistent with the behavior of an existing hardware switch: This is not a function of the P4 parser. This might be a function of a verification tool or testing framework that checks the consistency of P4 programs against hardware capabilities.

d. Translating a packet processing specification to a state machine: The P4 parser does indeed translate the packet processing logic into a state machine that dictates how packets are processed step-by-step as they move through the pipeline.

e. Mapping logical tables to underlying switch resources: This is typically a role of the compiler or control plane, which maps the high-level P4 program's logical tables to the actual physical resources available on the switch hardware.","['https://p4.org/p4-spec/docs/P4-16-v1.0.0-spec.html#sec-parsers', 'https://p4.org/p4-spec/docs/P4-16-v1.0.0-spec.html#sec-p4-program']",0,11_protocol_independent_forwarding,0.9,0.8835157425397295
82,"Which of the following best describe the relationship between a language like P4, an assembler like NetASM, and target programmable hardware (e.g., RMT)?","a. P4 is much more amenable to ""cost semantics"" (i.e., figuring out how much a particular operation would cost in terms of power or area) than NetASM.
NetASM and P4 are two examples of high-level programming languages; they are interchangeable.
b. P4 has verifiable semantics, whereas NetASM does not.
c. A language like P4 would ""compile"" to an assembly language like NetASM, which would then specify a one-to-one relationship with resources on the target forwarding hardware.
d. A language like NetASM would ""compile"" to an assembly language like P4, which would then specify a one-to-one relationship with resources on the target forwarding hardware.
",,c,c,,"P4 is a high-level language designed for programming protocol-independent packet processors. NetASM is a low-level assembly-like language that provides a one-to-one mapping to the resources on the target hardware. The relationship between a high-level language like P4 and an assembly language like NetASM is similar to that between high-level programming languages and assembly languages in general computing. The high-level language (P4) is compiled down to a lower-level representation (NetASM), which is then used to program the hardware directly. This process allows for abstraction from the hardware specifics when writing the program, which is then translated into specific hardware instructions. Therefore, option c is correct, as it describes the typical compilation process from a high-level language to an assembly language and then to hardware-specific configurations.","['P4 Language Consortium: https://p4.org/', 'NetASM: A New Network Assembly Language for Programmable Data Planes (Paper): https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/netasm-a-new-network-assembly-language-for-programmable-data-planes/']",1,11_protocol_independent_forwarding,0.95,0.999266640939299

b. DRP
c. LBL
d. MKT
e. MKR
",,"d,e","c,d,e",,"In NetASM (Network Assembly), which is a low-level instruction set architecture for programmable networks, certain instructions are responsible for creating state elements. A state element is a construct that holds state within the network device (such as a switch or router). The 'LBL' (c) instruction creates a label, which is a type of state element used for control flow in the program. 'MKT' (d) and 'MKR' (e) instructions are used to create tables and registers, respectively, both of which are state elements that store data or state information used in processing network packets. 'JMP' (a) is a jump instruction used for control flow and does not create a state element. 'DRP' (b) is likely a drop instruction to discard a packet, which also does not create a state element.","['NetASM: A New Programmable Abstraction for Middlebox Networks', 'Software Defined Networking (SDN): Layers and Architecture Terminology']",0,11_protocol_independent_forwarding,0.95,0.8792633151181931
84,Which of the following are true about locally contained applications? Select all that apply.,"a. Locally contained applications can be implemented with regular OpenFlow instructions.
b. A MAC learning switch can be implemented as a locally contained application.
c. Locally contained applications forward packets more slowly than their stateless counterparts.
d. A locally contained application can implement SDN logic without ever requiring a packet to be sent to the controller.
e. Locally contained applications allow the hardware pipeline to make switch-local state modifications.
",,"b,d,e","a,b,d,e",,"Locally contained applications are those that can operate solely within the switch's processing capabilities without requiring intervention from the SDN controller for every packet. They are designed to handle packets locally and can be implemented using OpenFlow or other SDN protocols, which means regular OpenFlow instructions can be used to implement them (a). A MAC learning switch, which learns the ports associated with MAC addresses to forward packets more efficiently, can indeed be implemented as a locally contained application (b). Since these applications do not need to communicate with the controller for every decision, they can implement SDN logic autonomously (d). They also allow for switch-local state modifications (e), which can be made by the hardware pipeline to optimize performance. The statement that locally contained applications forward packets more slowly than their stateless counterparts (c) is not necessarily true, as the purpose of locally contained applications is to make forwarding decisions quickly and locally without the overhead of controller communication.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/cs-openflow-spec-v1.3.0.pdf', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-is-software-defined-networking-sdn/']",0,11_protocol_independent_forwarding,0.95,0.9911558652716377

b. Forwarding packets for high-volume flows at higher rates.
c. Composing or decomposing tables to save either on table size or table width.
d. Only instantiating hardware resources (e.g., table entries) for flows that actually have nonzero traffic volume.
