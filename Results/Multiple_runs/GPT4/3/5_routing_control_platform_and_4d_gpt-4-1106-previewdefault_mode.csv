32,What are some of the reasons that it is difficult to deploy improvements to BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. Changes are necessarily incremental because of the large installed base of routers that already run BGP.
b. BGP is implemented in hardware, so deploying changes to BGP requires changes on the timescale of hardware development cycles.
c. Deplyoing changes to BGP requires coordination across potentially tens of thousands of ASes in the Internet.
d. Only a few vendors implement BGP, and deploying changes requires convincing those vendors to change the protocol.
e. Deploying changes requires coordination in standards bodies such as the IETF.
",,"a,c,e","a,c,e",,"Deploying improvements to BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is challenging for several reasons. First, BGP has a large installed base of routers, and any changes must be incremental to avoid disrupting the existing infrastructure, hence option (a) is correct. Second, changes to BGP require coordination across a vast number of Autonomous Systems (ASes), which can be tens of thousands, making it a complex logistical challenge, so option (c) is correct. Lastly, BGP is a standardized protocol, and any changes to it require coordination and agreement within standards bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), making option (e) correct. Option (b) is incorrect because BGP is not implemented in hardware; it is a control-plane protocol that is typically implemented in software on routers. Option (d) is also incorrect because BGP is implemented by a variety of vendors, not just a few.","['https://www.ietf.org/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)']",1,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.95,0.9104802989778835
33,Which of the following are true about the RCP? Select all that apply.,"a. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, the RCP controller for an AS sees all routes for all destinations that an AS learns from neighboring ASes.
b. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, there is no need for ASes to use BGP to exchange routes.
c. In an RCP deployment, routers no longer have to compute routes.
d. The RCP controller operates just like a route reflector would, selecting a single best route for each destination for all client routers.
e. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, a single AS can benefit from deploying RCP even if no other ASes deploy RCP.
",,"c,e","a,c,e",,"The Routing Control Platform (RCP) is a concept in the context of Software Defined Networking (SDN) that separates the control plane from the data plane. This allows for centralized control over routing decisions, which can be made by an RCP controller rather than individual routers. Here's a breakdown of the choices provided:

- a. True. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, the RCP controller for an Autonomous System (AS) does indeed see all routes for all destinations that the AS learns from neighboring ASes. This is because the RCP consolidates the control plane information.
- b. False. Even with RCP, ASes would still use BGP to exchange routes with each other. The RCP does not replace the need for BGP but rather centralizes the control of routing decisions.
- c. True. With an RCP, routers are relieved from computing routes as this task is offloaded to the central RCP controller.
- d. False. The RCP controller does more than a route reflector. While a route reflector selects a single best route for each destination for its clients, an RCP controller has a more global view and can make more informed routing decisions.
- e. True. An AS can benefit from deploying RCP independently of other ASes because it can optimize its internal routing decisions and operations with RCP, even if neighboring ASes have not deployed RCP.","['https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-rtgwg-rcp-00.txt', 'https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos561/papers/rcp.pdf', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/software-defined-networking-in-a-wide-area-network-sd-wan/']",0,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.95,0.9391769296583782
34,"Which of the following are true about network management with BGP, in the absence of RCP? Select all that apply.","a. BGP's interaction with the underlying routing IGP routing protocol can result in persistent forwarding loops.
b. Implementing network-wide policy sometimes causes the routers themeselves to have to carry state.
c. Each router operates and makes decisions based only on a local view of network state.
d. BGP routing has a single point of failure.
e. It is not possible to perform traffic engineering with conventional BGP.
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"In the absence of a Routing Control Platform (RCP), traditional network management using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) has several characteristics and limitations. Here are the reasons for selecting the given options:

a. BGP's interaction with the underlying Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) can indeed result in persistent forwarding loops. This is because BGP does not have complete visibility into the IGP metrics and may make decisions that are suboptimal or even create loops.

b. Implementing network-wide policies can cause routers to carry additional state because each router needs to maintain the policy rules and the state of the routes that are affected by these policies.

c. BGP routers operate based on their local view of the network. Each router makes decisions based on the information it receives from its neighbors, which may not reflect the global state of the network.

d. BGP routing does not inherently have a single point of failure. BGP is designed to be a decentralized protocol where each router independently constructs a view of the network based on the information it receives from its peers.

e. It is possible to perform traffic engineering with conventional BGP, although it may not be as flexible or efficient as with more advanced techniques like those enabled by Software Defined Networking (SDN). BGP traffic engineering can be done through route manipulation, selective advertisement, and other BGP attributes.

b. The second phase of RCP deployment offers potential benefits such as reduced routing table size.
c. In the second phase of deployment, the RCP controller sees all routes for every destination that neighboring ASes advertise.
d. The second phase of deployment requires fewer BGP sessions at the RCP controller than the first phase, thus improving scalability of the controller.
e. In the second phase of RCP deployment, ASes do not need to use BGP to exchange routes with one another.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"The second phase of RCP (Routing Control Platform) deployment typically involves the RCP controller having a more comprehensive view of the network.

Improved security (a) is a goal because a simpler control plane can be better understood, monitored, and protected. The inherent robustness of the control plane (b) is enhanced when complexity is reduced, as there are fewer points of failure and interactions are more predictable. Simpler management systems (c) are a result of a less complicated control plane, making it easier for network operators to manage the network. Faster innovation (d) is facilitated by a simpler control plane because it allows for quicker implementation and testing of new ideas.

Maintaining a single table in memory of AS paths that are learned across all BGP sessions in the AS, and using references into that table for specific routers (and routing decisions), to save memory.
b. If secure BGP were deployed, verifying the signatures on the AS paths of routes received from neighbors.

e. Performing inbound traffic engineering on a set of links in a coordinated fashion.
",,"a,b,c","a,c,d,e",,"The 4D architecture separates the decision logic from the protocols, which enables centralized computation and management. This can lead to more efficient use of resources. For example, maintaining a single table of AS paths (a) can save memory across the network because each router doesn't have to store and manage its own complete set of paths. Keeping track of topology information (c) can be more efficiently done in a centralized manner, rather than having each router discover and manage its own view of the network. Performing route computation centrally (d) means that complex calculations only need to be done once for the entire AS, rather than each router doing its own computations. Finally, performing inbound traffic engineering in a coordinated fashion (e) allows for a more efficient use of network resources and can prevent suboptimal routing decisions that might occur if routers acted independently.
