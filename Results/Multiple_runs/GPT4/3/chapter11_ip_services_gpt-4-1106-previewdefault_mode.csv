You are responsible to find out why users are not being able to reach the Internet.","a. The cause is not related to dynamic NAT
b. The command output does not provide any clue to identify the problem
c. Dynamic NAT can't use Standard ACLs
d. The NAT pool does not have enough entries to fulfill the user's requests
",,d,d,,"The output indicates that the NAT pool 'examsdigest' has a total of 10 addresses and all 10 are already allocated (100%). Furthermore, there have been 595 misses, which suggests that additional attempts to allocate NAT addresses have been made but were unsuccessful due to the pool being fully utilized. This implies that the NAT pool does not have enough IP addresses to accommodate the demand from the inside network, which is why users are unable to reach the Internet.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/network-address-translation-nat/13772-12.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipaddr_nat/configuration/15-mt/nat-15-mt-book/iadnat-addr-consv.html']",1,chapter11_ip_services,0.95,0.9999763235462916

d. 5
",,c,c,,"In Cisco IOS, log messages are categorized into eight severity levels, from 0 to 7. Level 4 is labeled as 'Warning' and indicates a warning condition.

Host A and host B attach to the same LAN and have correct default router settings per the FHRP configuration. Which of the following statements is true for this LAN?","a. You can't connect two routers to the same LAN subnet.
b. If one router fails, hosts can't send packets off-subnet

d. if one router fails, only one of the two hosts will still be able to send packets off-subnet
",,c,c,,"First Hop Redundancy Protocols (FHRPs) like HSRP, VRRP, or GLBP allow multiple routers to work together to present the appearance of a single virtual router to the hosts on the LAN. The routers share a virtual IP address that is configured as the default gateway for hosts on the LAN. If one of the routers fails, the other router(s) participating in the FHRP will take over, providing redundancy and ensuring that hosts can still send packets off-subnet. Therefore, if one router fails, both hosts will use the one remaining router as a default router.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/hot-standby-router-protocol-hsrp/13780-6.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12-2SX/configuration/guide/book/hsrp.html']",1,chapter11_ip_services,0.95,0.9999956342685299

Loss - QoS can minimize packet loss by managing congestion and prioritizing traffic. d. Delay - QoS can reduce latency for time-sensitive applications like voice and video. f. Jitter - QoS can minimize variation in delay for packets, which is important for real-time communications.
