90,The protocol used to communicate network errors is known as __________.,"a. ICMP
b. Traceroute
c. TCP
d. UDP
",,a,a,,"The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is used to communicate network errors. It is utilized by network devices, like routers, to send error messages and operational information indicating that a requested service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached. ICMP is used for diagnostics and troubleshooting, such as in the utilities ping and traceroute, but it should be noted that traceroute uses ICMP messages for its operation. TCP and UDP are transport layer protocols used for data transmission but do not communicate network errors in the same way ICMP does.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13714-43.html', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc792']",1,google_6_troubleshooting_and_future_networking,1,1.0

c. Destination Network Unknown
d. Destination Network Unreachable
",,a,a,,"The ping utility is used to test the reachability of a host on an IP network and measures the round-trip time for messages sent from the originating host to a destination computer. It operates by sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Echo Request messages to the destination host and waits for a response.
