(c) DNS allows administrative changes to happen seamlessly because when an IP address changes, the administrator only needs to update the DNS record, and users continue to use the same domain name without noticing any change. Option (b) is incorrect because DNS does not directly assist a node in finding its network ID; that is more related to IP addressing and subnetting.
