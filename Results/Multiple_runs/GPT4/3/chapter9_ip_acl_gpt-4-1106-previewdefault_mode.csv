For a subnet with the mask 255.255.255.0, the wildcard mask would be 0.0.0.255. This is because the wildcard mask bits are set to 0 where the subnet mask bits are 1 (255 in decimal) and to 1 where the subnet mask bits are 0. Since the subnet mask 255.255.255.0 corresponds to a /24 prefix, the wildcard mask allows any IP address in the last octet (0-255) to match, effectively matching the entire subnet.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_mask', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/26448-ACLsamples.html']",1,chapter9_ip_acl,0.99,0.9999998063873687
