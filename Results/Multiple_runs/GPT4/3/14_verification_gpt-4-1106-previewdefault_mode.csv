106,Which of the following are true about configuration verification? Select all that apply.,"a. Configuration verification can only detect errors after the configuration is installed on production routers.
b. Configuration verification cannot detect incorrect protocol behavior that may result from faulty hardware.
c. Verifying the correctness of network behavior based on configuration requires a model of protocol behavior.
d. Configuration verification requires a large-scale simulation of network protocols, complete with tests for different message orderings and timings.
e. Configuration verification cannot detect incorrect protocol behavior that may result from buggy software.
",,"b,c,e","b,c",,"Configuration verification is the process of ensuring that a network configuration will behave as expected before it is deployed. It includes checking for errors and ensuring that the configuration aligns with network policies and requirements. Here's why the selected choices are true:

b. Configuration verification is primarily focused on the correctness of the configuration itself, rather than hardware issues. While it can detect misconfigurations that may lead to protocol errors, it cannot inherently detect faults due to hardware issues, which would require hardware diagnostics.

 c. To verify the correctness of network behavior based on configuration, it is necessary to have a model of protocol behavior. This model is used to predict how the network should behave under the given configuration, which can then be compared against the desired network behavior.

The other options are not necessarily true:

a. Configuration verification can be performed before deploying configurations to production routers, not only after.

 d. While large-scale simulation can be part of configuration verification, it is not a requirement. There are other methods like formal verification that can be used without simulating the entire network.

 e. Similar to hardware, configuration verification can detect misconfigurations that might lead to buggy behavior, but it cannot directly detect bugs in software itself. That would require software testing.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_configuration_and_change_management', 'https://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=1998559', 'https://www.networkworld.com/article/2343960/cisco-subnet-an-introduction-to-network-configuration-verification.html']",0,14_verification,0.95,0.9419467447477045

b. The current settings of link weights will result in all routers being connected.
c. The configuration of route reflectors and clients ensures that any route learned from a neighboring AS will propagate to all routers in the topology.
d. There is no traffic pattern that would ever result in a stateful firewall dropping traffic.
e. Any time that an infection occurs, hosts are automatically quarantined.
",,"a,b,c","a,c",,"Configuration verification involves examining the static configuration files of network devices to ensure that they are set up correctly according to the network design and policies. Here's why the selected options are verifiable through configuration verification:

a. A route learned from one peer will not be readvertised to another peer. This can be verified by checking the routing policies and filters configured on the routers to ensure that route propagation is behaving as intended.

b. The current settings of link weights do not directly guarantee that all routers will be connected, as this depends on the operational state of the links and routers, which is not discernible from configuration alone.

c. The configuration of route reflectors and clients can be verified by reviewing the BGP configuration on routers to ensure that the route reflector topology is set up correctly to propagate routes within the autonomous system.

d. Verifying that there is no traffic pattern that would result in a stateful firewall dropping traffic would require dynamic testing of the firewall's behavior under various traffic conditions, not just configuration verification.

e. Automatically quarantining hosts in case of an infection typically involves dynamic monitoring and response systems, not just static configuration, and thus cannot be verified by configuration alone.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/21321-bgp-toc.html', 'https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/concept/policy-bgp-route-reflection-understanding.html']",0,14_verification,0.95,0.824916390149969
108,Which of the following are true about data-plane verification? Select all that apply.,"a. Data-plane verification techniques such as header-space analysis typically operate on a single ""snapshot"" of data-plane state.
b. Data plane verification can only operate on the forwarding table of a single router or switch; network-wide analysis is not possible.
c. Data-plane verification may detect errors that configuration analysis can miss in the cases of buggy control-plane software.
d. Data-plane verification requires accurate modeling of network protocols, including which bits are present in which part of the packet header.
e. Header-space analysis can only provide verification/analysis for specific packets; it cannot answer questions for general parts of flowspace.
",,"a,c","a,c,d",,"Data-plane verification techniques, such as header-space analysis, operate on a snapshot of the network's data-plane state. This allows them to analyze the network's behavior at a specific point in time (a). Network-wide analysis is indeed possible with data-plane verification, so option (b) is incorrect. Data-plane verification can detect errors that may not be evident through configuration analysis alone, especially in cases where the control-plane software might have bugs (c). Accurate modeling of network protocols is required for data-plane verification, as it needs to understand how different bits in the packet header affect forwarding decisions (d).

b. Two virtual network ""slices"" are not completely isolated: it is possible for traffic to travel from one slice to the other.
c. The configuration of the network's routing protocols will result in persistent oscillation (i.e., they will never settle on a stable set of routes).
d. The forwarding table state in the routers across the network will result in a forwarding loop.
e. The rules installed on the firewalls in the network ensure that only port 80 traffic can ever reach the web server from the rest of the Internet.
",,"b,d,e","b,d,e",,"Data plane verification is concerned with the current state of the network, including forwarding tables, firewall rules, and potential traffic flows. Therefore, it can be used to verify the following assertions:

b. Two virtual network 'slices' are not completely isolated: Data plane verification can assess the current forwarding rules and paths to determine if there are any points where traffic from one slice could inadvertently be routed to the other slice.

d. The forwarding table state in the routers across the network will result in a forwarding loop: By analyzing the current state of the forwarding tables, data plane verification can detect if there are any loops in the network that would cause packets to circulate endlessly.

e. The rules installed on the firewalls in the network ensure that only port 80 traffic can ever reach the web server from the rest of the Internet: Data plane verification can inspect firewall rules to confirm that they are correctly filtering traffic based on port numbers and other criteria.

e. Pyretic's composition operators can help prevent state explosion.
",,"a,c,e","a,b,c,e",,"Kinetic is a policy framework for programming networks based on a finite state machine abstraction. The following statements are true about Kinetic policies: 

a. State transitions in Kinetic can be exogenous, triggered by external events, or endogenous, triggered by internal conditions or state changes. This allows for flexible policy definitions. 

b. Kinetic's NuSMV verifier can indeed be used to verify properties of the network, such as ensuring that the data plane will never have forwarding loops, which is crucial for network reliability. 

c. State transitions in Kinetic can be based on timing, such as timeouts. This allows for policies that change state after a certain period, which is useful for implementing features like failover or load balancing. 

e. Pyretic is a network programming language that supports modular composition of network policies. Its composition operators can be used to build complex policies from simpler ones, which can help manage and prevent state explosion by allowing for reuse and better organization of policy logic.

'EF' stands for 'exists finally', which means that there exists some path where eventually the property will hold. Combining the two, 'AG EF policy=allow' states that it is always true (AG) that there is some path (EF) leading to a state where the policy is 'allow'.
