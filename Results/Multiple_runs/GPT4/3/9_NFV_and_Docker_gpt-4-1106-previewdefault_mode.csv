72,"In NFV, which of the following is the function of steering?","a. Finding the best location to place a single network function in an enterprise or wide area network.
b. Installing custom packet processing code on servers in the network.
c. Placing middleboxes at places throughout the network to minimize network load.
d. Installing custom packet processing code on switches in the network.
e. Installing flow table entries in switches to forward traffic through network functions or middleboxes that are installed in the network
",,e,e,,"In Network Function Virtualization (NFV), steering refers to the process of directing traffic through virtualized network functions (VNFs) or middleboxes. This is typically achieved by installing flow table entries in switches that dictate how traffic should be forwarded through the network to ensure that it passes through the necessary network functions. This can involve the use of Software Defined Networking (SDN) controllers to program the switches dynamically based on the desired network policies.",[],1,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.95,0.9897573632684535
74,What are some advantages of Docker containers over virtual machines? Select all that apply.,"a. Containers can be connected to build a virtual network, whereas virtual machines cannot.
b. Performance in containers may be better since they invoke OS system calls directly, rather than through an emulated machine.
c. Containers require less storage and memory per-instance, and require less time to instantiate than virtual machines.
d. Containers provide more flexibility in the choice of operating system.
e. Containers provide better isolation than virtual machines.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"Containers are often preferred over virtual machines for several reasons. One of the key advantages is that containers share the host system's kernel, allowing them to make system calls directly to the host kernel rather than through a hypervisor, as virtual machines do. This can result in better performance (b). Additionally, containers are more lightweight than virtual machines because they do not need to include a full operating system within each instance. This means they require less storage and memory and can be instantiated more quickly (c). However, containers do not necessarily provide more flexibility in the choice of operating system (d) because all containers on a host must use the same kernel, and they do not provide better isolation than virtual machines (e). In fact, virtual machines are generally considered to provide stronger isolation since each VM runs a separate kernel and operating system instance.","['https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container', 'https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/containers', 'https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/what-is-a-linux-container']",1,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.95,0.9999988527586581
75,Which of the following commands is used to instantiate a new Docker container by invoking a command in that container?,"a. docker stop
b. docker attach
c. docker commit
d. docker pull
e. docker run
",,e,e,,"The 'docker run' command is used to create a new container from an image and start it immediately. It can also be used to run a command in a new container. The other commands have different purposes: 'docker stop' stops a running container, 'docker attach' attaches to a running container, 'docker commit' creates a new image from a container's changes, and 'docker pull' pulls an image from a registry.","['https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/', 'https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stop/', 'https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/attach/', 'https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/commit/', 'https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/']",1,9_NFV_and_Docker,1,0.9999998063873687
76,Which of the following is true about networking Docker containers? Select all that apply.,"a. Docker containers can be networked to each other via the native Docker bridge or Open vSwitch.
b. A Docker container can never expose a low port (e.g., port 80) to the external Internet; Internet hosts must always reach a Docker service by a high port (e.g., 8080).
c. Docker containers running in different virtual machines cannot be networked together.
d. Connecting Docker containers requires setting up GRE tunnels between the containers.
e. Docker containers are not reachable from the external Internet by default.
",,"a,e","a,e",,"Docker containers can be networked together using various networking options. The default networking option is a bridge network, but other options like host and overlay networks are also available. Open vSwitch can also be used for more advanced networking scenarios. Therefore, option (a) is true. By default, Docker containers are not directly exposed to the external Internet; they are reachable through the Docker host machine. This makes option (e) true as well. However, option (b) is incorrect because Docker allows port mapping, which means low ports like 80 can be exposed to the external Internet by mapping them to the host's ports. Option (c) is incorrect because Docker containers can be networked across different virtual machines, particularly when using overlay networks. Option (d) is also incorrect; while GRE tunnels could be used in some advanced scenarios, they are not a requirement for connecting Docker containers.","['https://docs.docker.com/network/', 'https://docs.docker.com/network/overlay/', 'https://docs.docker.com/network/bridge/', 'https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/']",1,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.95,0.9997118141208803
