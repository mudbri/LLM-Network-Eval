43,Which of the following statements are true about the OpenFlow specification? Select all that apply.,"a. If a switch does not contain a flow table entry that matches a particular packet, the switch forwards the packet to the controller for handling.
b. The main purpose of the OpenFlow control channel is to update flow table entries on switches.
c. The OpenFlow specification provides mechanisms to perform Layer 2 learning across a network of switches.
d. Once a switch has sent one packet for a flow, it must also send all subsequent packets for that flow to the controller.
e. Some versions of the OpenFlow specification allow for performing more than one action on a single packet.
",,"a,b,e","a,b,e",,"The OpenFlow specification defines the communication between the control plane and the data plane in Software Defined Networking (SDN). Here are the reasons for the selected answers:

a. True. If a switch does not have a flow table entry that matches an incoming packet, it typically sends the packet to the controller, following the OpenFlow protocol. The controller then decides how to handle the packet, which might include adding a new flow table entry to handle such packets in the future.

b. True. The main purpose of the OpenFlow control channel is indeed to allow the controller to manage and update the flow table entries on the switches. This is a core aspect of SDN, where the control plane (controller) dynamically configures the data plane (switches).

e. True. OpenFlow allows for specifying multiple actions to be performed on packets. For example, OpenFlow actions can include forwarding a packet to a port, modifying fields in the packet, or even sending it to multiple ports (multicast).

d. This statement is false because once a flow entry is installed in the switch, subsequent packets matching the flow do not need to be sent to the controller; they can be processed directly by the switch according to the flow table rules.

c. This statement is misleading because the OpenFlow specification itself does not provide mechanisms for Layer 2 learning across switches. Layer 2 learning is typically a function of traditional Ethernet switches and can be implemented by an SDN controller using OpenFlow, but it is not a built-in feature of the OpenFlow specification itself.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/software-defined-standards/specifications/', 'https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/openflow-spec-v1.0.0.pdf', 'https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/openflow-spec-v1.1.0.pdf']",1,6_control_plane,0.95,0.9994943637584723
44,Which of the following statements are true about dpctl? Select all that apply.,"a. dpctl is invoked from within the Mininet emulator.
b. dpctl can modify flow table entries on an OpenFlow switch.
c. dpctl can respond to network events, such as packets sent from a switch.
d. dpctl is an OpenFlow controller.
e. dpctl can inspect flow table entries on an OpenFlow switch.
",,"b,e","b,e",,"dpctl is a command-line utility used to interact with OpenFlow switches. It is typically used to manage and inspect the flow table entries on an OpenFlow switch (option 'e').

However, dpctl is not an OpenFlow controller (option 'd') as it does not manage the state of the network or respond to network events like an OpenFlow controller would. It is also not necessarily invoked from within the Mininet emulator (option 'a'), as it can be used independently of Mininet to interact with any OpenFlow-compatible switch. dpctl does not respond to network events (option 'c'); it is a management tool, not an event-driven program.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/openflow-switch-specification-1.5.0.pdf', 'https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Introduction-to-Mininet#using-the-openflow-utilities', 'https://docs.faucet.nz/en/latest/openflow.html']",1,6_control_plane,0.95,0.9987258205768185

c. Ease of learning curve.
d. Need for production-quality operation.
e. Speed of prototyping.
",,"a,b,c,d,e","a,b,c,d,e",,"When choosing a controller for Software Defined Networking (SDN), several factors should be taken into account to ensure that it meets the requirements of the network it is intended to manage.

47,Which of the following are true about Pox? Select all that apply.,"a. Pox automatically determines the order to install flow table rules, to avoid inconsistent forwarding behavior.
b. Pox's _handle_PacketIn function determines how a packet should be handled when it arrives at the controller.
c. Pox provides a function to modify flow table entries at a switch.
d. Pox's performance is typically slower than NOX.
e. Pox automatically determines the priority between two conflicting rules.
",,"b,c,d","b,c,d",,"POX is an open-source development platform for Python-based Software Defined Networking (SDN) control applications, such as OpenFlow SDN controllers. Here's the analysis of each option:

a. This statement is not accurate. POX does not automatically determine the order to install flow table rules to avoid inconsistent forwarding behavior. Instead, the logic to handle such situations must be implemented by the controller application developer.

b. The _handle_PacketIn function in POX is indeed used to determine how a packet should be handled when it arrives at the controller. This function is a callback that is called when a PacketIn event is raised, indicating that a packet has reached the controller from a switch because there was no matching flow entry in the switch's flow table.

c. POX provides functions to modify flow table entries at a switch. This can be done using the OpenFlow protocol messages that POX can send to the switches to add, modify, or delete flow entries.

d. POX's performance is typically considered slower than NOX, which is another SDN controller platform. NOX is written in C++ and was one of the first SDN controllers developed. It is generally faster than POX, which is interpreted Python code.

e. POX does not automatically determine the priority between two conflicting rules. The priority of flow rules is something that the controller application developer must manage explicitly when sending flow-modification messages to the switch.","['https://noxrepo.github.io/pox-doc/html/', 'https://github.com/noxrepo/pox', 'https://www.opennetworking.org/software-defined-standards/models-protocols/']",1,6_control_plane,0.95,0.999986306852852
48,What is the difference between a hard timeout and an idle timeout?,"a. A hard timeout occurs exactly at the specified interval, whereas an idle timeout may occur slightly later than the specified interval.
b. A hard timeout expunges a flow table entry regardless of whether there have been active matches, whereas an idle timeout expunges the flow table entry only if there have been no matches for that flow within the specified interval.
c. A hard timeout expunges all flow table entry from the switch, whereas an idle timeout only expunges one flow at a time.
d. A hard timeout expunges a flow table entry for all switches in the network, whereas an idle timeout only expunges the flow table entry on the switches that have seen no matches for that flow within the specified interval.
",,b,b,,"In the context of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and specifically within OpenFlow protocol, which is often used for SDN, a hard timeout is used to remove a flow entry from the flow table after a fixed period of time, regardless of whether the flow has seen any packets recently. On the other hand, an idle timeout is used to remove a flow entry only if it has not matched any packets within a specified period of time. This means that a flow entry with an idle timeout will remain in the flow table as long as there is matching traffic at regular intervals, but once the traffic stops and the timeout period elapses, the entry will be removed.",['https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/openflow-switch-v1.3.0.pdf'],1,6_control_plane,0.95,0.9999288827389523
49,Which of the following are true about hubs and learning switches? Select all that apply,"a. A hub implemented in Pox requires all incoming packets to be directed to the controller.
b. A learning switch requires more logic at the controller (in terms of lines of code in Pox) than a hub.
c. A learning switch implemented in Pox can be easily extended to support firewall capabilities.
d. A learning switch implemented in Pox requires all incoming packets to be redirected to the controller.
e. A hub forwards an incoming packet on all ports (except the incoming port), whereas a switch only floods an incoming packet on all ports if it does not have a table entry that determines the output port for that packet.
",,"b,c,e","b,c,e",,"a. This is not necessarily true. A hub implemented in Pox or any other controller doesn't require all packets to be directed to the controller. A basic hub functionality can be achieved by simply forwarding all incoming packets to all ports except the incoming port, which doesn't require controller intervention for each packet once the initial behavior is set.
b. True. A learning switch requires additional logic to maintain a table of MAC addresses and corresponding ports, which means more lines of code compared to a simple hub that forwards packets indiscriminately.
c. True. Since a learning switch maintains a table of MAC addresses, it can be extended to include firewall capabilities by adding rules that filter packets based on source or destination addresses or other criteria.
d. False. A learning switch implemented in Pox does not require all incoming packets to be redirected to the controller. It only needs to send packets to the controller when it does not have the destination MAC address in its table. Once it learns the address, it can forward packets to the correct port without involving the controller.
e. True. A hub is a simple device that forwards an incoming packet on all ports except the incoming port. A learning switch, on the other hand, will only flood the packet if it does not have a table entry for the destination MAC address. If it has the entry, it will forward the packet to the specific port associated with the destination MAC address.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch#Layer_2_switching', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_hub', 'https://github.com/noxrepo/pox']",1,6_control_plane,0.95,0.9988314662645783

b. _handle_PacketIn
c. AddRule
d. init
e. launch
",,a,"a,b",,"In the context of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and more specifically within the OpenFlow protocol, the controller uses certain functions to manage communication with switches.

'AddRule' is more related to adding a flow rule to a switch and does not directly ensure the controller hears PacketIn messages. 'init' is a generic initialization function and 'launch' could be a function to start the controller, but neither of these are specifically for handling PacketIn messages.",['https://www.opennetworking.org/software-defined-standards/specifications/'],0,6_control_plane,0.95,0.980021519387433

b. action
c. redirect
d. drop
e. forward
",,"a,b","a,b",,"In OpenFlow, which is a communications protocol that gives access to the forwarding plane of a network switch or router over the network, a flow table entry consists of two key steps: match and action.

b. It only supports OpenFlow as a ""southbound"" control framework.
c. Its code shares a lot of similarities with Beacon.
d. Open Daylight only supports proprietary switches from Cisco and IBM.
e. It is slower and less scalable than some of the more lightweight SDN controllers such as Pox.

Option (b) is incorrect because OpenDaylight supports multiple southbound protocols, not just OpenFlow; it is designed to be extensible to support a variety of network devices and protocols. Option (c) is correct because OpenDaylight's codebase was initially derived from the Beacon controller, and thus, they share similarities. Option (d) is incorrect because OpenDaylight is an open-source project and supports a wide range of switches, not just proprietary switches from Cisco and IBM.
