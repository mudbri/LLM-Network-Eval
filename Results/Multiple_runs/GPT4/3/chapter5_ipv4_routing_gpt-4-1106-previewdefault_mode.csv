91,You have noticed that a server with IP 145.45.3.2 doesn’t respond to requests. What command will you type first in order to test connectivity between your device and the server?,"a. request 145.45.3.2

",,c,c,,"The 'ping' command is commonly used to test connectivity between two devices on a network. It uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo requests to determine if the target IP address is reachable and to measure the round-trip time for messages sent from the originating host to a destination computer. Both 'c' and 'd' are the same 'ping' command, but since 'c' is listed first, it is the appropriate choice.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13730-ext-ping-trace.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)']",1,chapter5_ipv4_routing,1,0.9999454510038506
92,"A LAN design uses a Layer 3 EtherChannel between two switches SW1 and SW2, with port-channel interface 1 used on both switches. SW1 uses ports G0/1 and G0/2 in the channel. However, only interface G0/1 is bundled into the channel and working. Think about the configuration settings on port G0/2 that could have existed before adding G0/2 to the EtherChannel. Which answers identify a setting that could prevent IOS from adding G0/2 to the Layer 3 EtherChannel? (Choose two answers.)","a. A different STP cost (spanning-tree cost value)
b. A different access VLAN (switchport access vlan vlanid)
c. A different speed (speed value)
d. A default setting for switchport (switchport)
",,"c,d","b,c",,"When configuring an EtherChannel, it is important that all the interfaces have the same settings to ensure they can form an EtherChannel properly. If the interfaces have different settings, the EtherChannel will not form correctly. Specifically, a different access VLAN (switchport access vlan vlanid) would mean that the interfaces are assigned to different VLANs, which is not allowed for EtherChannel members. Similarly, a different speed (speed value) on the interfaces would prevent them from being compatible for an EtherChannel because all interfaces in an EtherChannel must operate at the same speed. A different STP cost would not prevent an interface from joining an EtherChannel, as EtherChannel itself is treated as a single interface for STP purposes. The default setting for switchport (switchport) would not necessarily prevent an interface from joining an EtherChannel, unless it caused a compatibility issue with other interfaces in the channel.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-6500-series-switches/21066-135.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750/software/release/12-2_55_se/configuration/guide/scg3750/swethchl.html']",0,chapter5_ipv4_routing,0.95,0.8535043460873835
