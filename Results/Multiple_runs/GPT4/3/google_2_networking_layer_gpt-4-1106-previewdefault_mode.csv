The class C address space supports 256 addresses, but 2 addresses are reserved: one for the network address and one for the broadcast address, leaving 254 for host devices.

b. Class B
c. Class E
d. Class A

This allows for a moderate number of networks with a moderate number of hosts.

b. service type field
c. fragmentation offset field
d. total length field
",,a,a,,"The flag field in the IP header is used to control or identify fragments. It includes bits that indicate whether a datagram can be fragmented and whether a datagram is the last fragment in a series of fragmented packets. Specifically, one of the bits in the flag field is set to 0 if the datagram is allowed to be fragmented and is set to 1 if it is not. Thus, the flag field is used to indicate that the datagram is allowed to be fragmented or to indicate that the datagram has already been fragmented.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Flags', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc791']",1,google_2_networking_layer,0.95,0.9996572059673049

b. ARP
c. network
d. MAC addresses
",,c,c,,"The IP address assigned to a device depends on the network to which it is connected. IP addresses are logically assigned to network interfaces based on the network's addressing scheme and subnetting. This is typically managed through a DHCP server within the network that assigns IP addresses dynamically, or through static IP address assignment, where network administrators manually configure the IP settings.","['https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc791.html', 'https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2131.html']",1,google_2_networking_layer,1,0.9999992103693117

c. Class Interconnect Destination Routing
d. Classless Inter-Domain Routing

28,How many octets does a subnet mask have?,"a. 1
b. 3
c. 4
d. 2
",,c,c,,"A subnet mask is used in IP networking to divide an IP address into a network and host identifier.

31,Which of the following are types of Interior Gateway Protocols? (Select all that apply),"a. Link State Routing Protocols
b. Distance-Vector Protocols
c. Hypertext Transfer Protocol
d. Transmission Control Protocol
",,"a,b","a,b",,"Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) are used to exchange routing information within a single autonomous system. There are two primary types of IGPs: Link State Routing Protocols and Distance-Vector Protocols. Link State Routing Protocols, such as OSPF and IS-IS, work by having routers learn the entire network topology to compute the shortest path to each node. Distance-Vector Protocols, like RIP, involve routers sharing their routing table with their immediate neighbors to propagate distance information throughout the network. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) are not routing protocols; HTTP is an application-layer protocol used for transmitting web pages, and TCP is a core protocol of the Internet Protocol Suite for reliable communication between hosts.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_gateway_protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-state_routing_protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance-vector_routing_protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol']",1,google_2_networking_layer,1,1.0

b. The IETF
c. It's for testing purposes only
d. The IANA
",,a,a,,"Non-routable address space, also known as private IP address space, is defined to be used freely by anyone within private networks. These addresses are not routable on the global internet, which means they can be used by any organization or individual within their own network without the risk of IP address conflicts with other parties on the internet.

d. Interior gateway protocols share information with multiple autonomous systems. Exterior Gateway Protocols are used for the exchange of information between independent autonomous systems.
",,b,b,,"Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) are used to exchange routing information within a single autonomous system (AS). Examples of IGPs include protocols such as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and RIP (Routing Information Protocol). On the other hand, Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs) are designed to exchange routing information between different autonomous systems. BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is the most widely used EGP. The key difference is that IGPs operate within a single AS while EGPs facilitate routing between separate ASes.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_gateway_protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_gateway_protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol']",1,google_2_networking_layer,1,0.9999998063873687
