1,Which of the following are true about Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)? Select all that apply.,"a. The only sizes for an IP address allocation before CIDR were 8, 16, or 24 bits.
b. The prefix length for a CIDR prefix can be anywhere in the range from 0 to 32 bits.
c. In an Internet forwarding table with CIDR, there can only be one unique matching entry for any given IP address.
d. CIDR slowed the rate of Internet routing table growth because prefixes no longer had to be allocated in fixed-size blocks.
",,"b,d","b,c,d",,"CIDR, or Classless Inter-Domain Routing, was introduced to improve the allocation of IP addresses and the scalability of route aggregation. Here is why the selected answers are true:

- b. The prefix length for a CIDR prefix can indeed be anywhere in the range from 0 to 32 bits. This flexibility allows for more efficient use of IP address space compared to the classful addressing system.

- c. In an Internet forwarding table with CIDR, there can only be one unique matching entry for any given IP address. This is because CIDR allows for the creation of more specific routes, which ensures that each IP address can be matched to a single best path.

- d. CIDR slowed the rate of Internet routing table growth because it allows for aggregation of prefixes. This means that multiple IP address ranges can be represented by a single routing entry, rather than having to have separate entries for each range as was the case with classful addressing.

The statement in option a is not entirely true because before CIDR, IP address allocations were based on classful network design, which did have standard sizes (Class A, B, C) corresponding to 8, 16, or 24 bits. However, this doesn't mean that these were the 'only' sizes, as there were also Class D and E addresses for special purposes.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing', 'https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4632']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9562138470633682
2,Which of the following are true about how DNS lookups work? Select all that apply.,"a. A DNS A-record query for google.com will only return a single IP address at a time.
b. An NS-record query for a DNS lookup will return the name(s) of the authoritative name server(s) for that domain.
c. If your local DNS resolver caches an NS record for google.com for multiple days, all clients who use that DNS resolver will continue using the same IP address to reach Google’s Web server until that NS record expires.
d. An MX-record query for a DNS lookup will return the IP address of the mail server for that domain.
e. All DNS PTR records are maintained by a single organization in-addr.arpa.
",,b,"b,d",,"Option (b) is correct because an NS-record (Name Server record) indeed points to the authoritative name server for a domain, which is responsible for providing answers to queries about the domain. Option (d) is also correct because an MX-record (Mail Exchange record) specifies the mail server responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a domain and may return multiple records, each pointing to a mail server with a specified priority.

Option (a) is incorrect because a DNS A-record (Address record) query for a domain like google.com can return multiple IP addresses, not just a single one. This is part of DNS load balancing and fault tolerance strategies. Option (c) is incorrect because caching an NS record does not affect the IP address used to reach a web server; it affects the DNS resolution process. The IP address for the web server is typically found in A or AAAA records, not NS records. Lastly, option (e) is incorrect because PTR records (used for reverse DNS lookups) are not maintained by a single organization; they are distributed among the owners of the IP addresses, and the in-addr.arpa domain is used for IPv4 reverse DNS lookups with different organizations responsible for different subdomains.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-ns-record/', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-mx-record/', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-a-record/', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-reverse-dns/']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9803952759561183
3,Which of the following are true about traffic control with BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
b. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
c. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
d. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
",,"a,b","a,b",,"a. The BGP local preference attribute is used to influence the outbound traffic policy. Higher local preference values are more preferred, and thus, a network operator can set the local preference to determine which route should be taken for traffic leaving their AS (Autonomous System).
b. BGP AS path prepending is a technique used to make a path look less favorable by artificially increasing the length of the AS path. This is typically done to influence the inbound traffic to an AS by making a route appear less attractive to external BGP peers, which can cause them to select a different route that does not use the prepended path.
c. BGP AS path prepending does not control outbound traffic. Outbound traffic is controlled by attributes such as local preference, MED, etc.
d. The BGP local preference attribute does not control inbound traffic. Inbound traffic is influenced by methods such as AS path prepending, advertising specific routes, or using BGP communities.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/13759-21.html', 'https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/topic-map/bgp-as-path-prepending.html']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9958680909047405
4,Which of the following are true about layering? Select all that apply.,"a. The network layer guarantees reliable, in-order delivery of packets.
b. The network layer has only a single protocol in widespread use today, representing what we call the “narrow waist”.
c. The transport layer uses port numbers.
d. The destination address in the link layer header is always the address of the next layer-3 node along an end-to-end IP path.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"Layering in networking refers to the design of network software in layers, each providing a specific function. Option 'b' is correct because the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) has a model with a 'narrow waist' of IP, indicating that the network layer (Layer 3) has essentially one universal protocol in widespread use, which is the Internet Protocol (IP). Option 'c' is correct because the transport layer (Layer 4) indeed uses port numbers to distinguish between different services or communication sessions on a single device. Option 'a' is incorrect because the network layer does not guarantee reliable, in-order delivery of packets; that is the role of some transport layer protocols like TCP. Option 'd' is incorrect because the destination address in the link layer header is the address of the next hop on the path to the destination, which may not be a layer-3 node if the next hop is a switch, for example.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9994328758520769
5,Which of the following are not true about packet switching? Select all that apply.,"a. Once a connection is established between two endpoints in a packet switched network, the end-to-end route cannot change, or the connection must be re-established.
b. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will always experience predictable latency.
c. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will never be dropped by intermediate nodes along the path.
d. A user of a packet switched network might occasionally get a “busy signal” if there are too many users on the network.
",,"a,b,c,d","a,b,c",,"Option (a) is not true because in packet-switched networks, the route can change dynamically even after a connection is established, and packets can take different paths to reach the destination. Option (b) is incorrect because latency in packet-switched networks can be unpredictable due to varying network conditions, congestion, and the dynamic nature of routing. Option (c) is also false because packets can indeed be dropped in a packet-switched network if there is congestion or if the network policy dictates so. Option (d) is not selected because it's a characteristic of circuit-switched networks, not packet-switched networks. In packet-switched networks, users do not get a 'busy signal'; instead, their data might experience delays or loss due to congestion.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching', 'https://www.techopedia.com/definition/26163/packet-switched-network', 'https://www.networkworld.com/article/2332925/understanding-latency-versus-throughput.html']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9507548117615086
6,Which of the following are true about content distribution networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Content distribution networks can improve the performance that a client sees by reducing the network latency between the client and the content that it is downloading.
b. Content distribution networks can reduce transit expenses for a content provider by enabling much of the provider’s content to be served from a nearby network, sometimes even from a cache that is within the client’s own network.
c. Real-time content such as video streams cannot be distributed from a content distribution network.
d. Content distribution networks typically redirect Web clients to a nearby Web cache by rewriting the IP address of packets sent from the client to the IP address of the nearby Web cache.
",,"a,b","a,b,d",,"Content distribution networks (CDNs) are designed to improve the delivery of content to clients across the internet. Option (a) is correct because CDNs distribute content across various locations closer to users, which reduces the distance data must travel, thereby reducing latency and improving performance. Option (b) is also correct as CDNs can reduce transit expenses by serving content from a location closer to the end-user, which can also include caching within the user's own network or a nearby network, thus reducing the amount of data that must travel across the content provider's network. Option (c) is incorrect because CDNs are indeed capable of distributing real-time content such as video streams; they use various optimization techniques to handle different content types, including live streaming. Option (d) is correct because CDNs typically use DNS redirection to direct clients to a nearby cache or server; however, the wording about rewriting the IP address of packets is somewhat misleading as the redirection typically happens at the DNS level rather than by rewriting IP addresses on the fly.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/', 'https://aws.amazon.com/cdn/', 'https://www.akamai.com/our-thinking/cdn/what-is-a-cdn']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9999960814670276
7,Which of the following are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control? Select all that apply.,"a. Only wireless networks can have collisions at the receiver; such collisions are not possible on wired Ethernet networks.
b. Using RTS/CTS (“request to send”, “clear to send”) control reduces the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network.
c. A wireless sender can avoid causing a collision at the receiver by performing a “carrier sense” to determine whether any other sender wants to transmit at the time that it wishes to send a packet.
d. Disabling RTS/CTS necessarily lowers the effective throughput of the wireless network, since more collisions will occur at the receiver without RTS/CTS enabled.
",,b,"b,c",,"Option (b) is true because the use of RTS/CTS frames in a wireless network adds overhead to the communication process. While RTS/CTS can help to avoid collisions by reserving the channel before the actual data transmission occurs, the additional control frame exchange reduces the time available for actual data transmission, thus potentially reducing the overall throughput of the network. Option (c) is true because carrier sense is part of the CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) protocol used in wireless networks. By sensing the carrier before transmitting, a wireless sender can avoid initiating a transmission while the channel is in use, which helps prevent collisions at the receiver. Option (a) is false because collisions can occur on both wireless and wired Ethernet networks. In wired Ethernet, this is typically handled by CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection). Option (d) is false because disabling RTS/CTS does not necessarily lower the effective throughput of the network. In some cases, particularly in networks with low collision probability or low traffic, the overhead of RTS/CTS can be more detrimental to throughput than the occasional collision.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-sense_multiple_access_with_collision_avoidance', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-sense_multiple_access_with_collision_detection', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11#MAC_layer']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.999746128147264
8,Which of the following are true about video streaming? Select all that apply.,"a. Using UDP to stream a video instead of TCP is appropriate if the client is more concerned about low delay and interactivity than it does about receiving a high-quality stream.
b. A larger playout buffer at the client allows the client more time to recover from lost packets.
c. Using TCP for video streaming could result in larger delays between transmission and playout than streaming the same video with UDP.
d. Since UDP provides no reliable delivery guarantees, a video streaming application that uses UDP as its transport cannot recover from any packet loss in the video stream.
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"a. UDP is often used for streaming media applications such as video conferencing where timely delivery is more important than perfect delivery. It is well-suited for situations where you prefer low delay and can tolerate some loss in data quality. Therefore, this statement is true.

b. A larger playout buffer at the client can indeed help in smoothing out the variations in packet arrival time and can provide additional time to recover from packet loss by using error correction techniques or retransmissions if supported. Hence, this statement is also true.

c. TCP includes congestion control and flow control mechanisms, which can introduce additional delays in the streaming of video as the protocol ensures reliable and ordered delivery. This can result in larger delays compared to UDP, which does not have these mechanisms and can send data as fast as the client and network will allow. So, this statement is true as well.

d. This statement is false. Even though UDP itself does not guarantee reliable delivery, applications can implement their own mechanisms on top of UDP to handle packet loss and ensure that the video stream can recover from such events. This can include error correction codes, retransmissions of lost packets, or simply ignoring the loss if it's not critical to the content.","['https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc768 - UDP', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793 - TCP', 'Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition, by James Kurose and Keith Ross, Pearson Education, 2016.']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9999944126236294
9,Which of the following are true about TCP? Select all that apply.,"a. TCP guarantees that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted.
b. A TCP sender and receiver use a “three-way handshake” both to set up and to terminate the TCP connection.
c. TCP’s congestion avoidance algorithm causes the sender to reduce its sending rate by a factor of two when it sees a packet loss.
d. A TCP sender controls its sending rate by adjusting the number of unacknowledged packets that can be sent over the network at any time.
",,"a,c,d","a,b,c,d",,"All of the statements provided are true characteristics of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). Here's why each statement is correct: a. TCP ensures reliable, in-order delivery of a stream of bytes from a program on one computer to a program on another computer, which means the receiver indeed sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted. b. TCP uses a 'three-way handshake' process to establish a connection between a client and server before data transmission begins and to gracefully close the connection when the transmission is complete. c. TCP's congestion avoidance algorithm, often referred to as 'TCP Tahoe' or 'TCP Reno', does indeed cut the congestion window size by half when packet loss is detected, which is interpreted as a signal of network congestion. d. TCP uses a flow control mechanism, where the sender controls the rate of data transmission according to the receiver's ability to receive the data (window-based flow control) and also adjusts the rate based on network congestion (congestion window).","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol', 'https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc793', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control']",0,1_SDN_Basics,1,0.9965752500514719
10,Which of the following are true about denial of service attacks (and defenses)? Select all that apply.,"a. If every network on the Internet performed stateless ingress filtering to defend against source IP spoofing, the DNS reflection attack would not work.
b. If every network on the Internet performed stateless egress filtering to defend against source IP address spoofing, the DNS reflection attack could not be carried out.
c. In a “SYN Flood” attack, each TCP SYN packet that a victim receives causes it to set up TCP connection state.
d. A “DNS Reflection” attack requires the attacking client to “spoof” the source IP address of the packet containing the DNS request.
",,"b,c,d","a,c,d",,"a. True. Stateless ingress filtering is a technique used to ensure that incoming packets have a source IP address that matches the network prefix of the interface on which they arrive. If every network performed this kind of filtering, it would be very difficult for attackers to use IP address spoofing to make their traffic appear to come from a legitimate source, which is necessary for the DNS reflection attack to work.
c. True. In a SYN Flood attack, the attacker sends a large number of TCP SYN packets to the victim's server with the intention of overwhelming it. Each packet causes the server to allocate resources and set up TCP connection state in anticipation of completing the three-way handshake, which can exhaust the server's resources and lead to denial of service.
d. True. In a DNS reflection attack, the attacker spoofs the source IP address in the DNS request packets to be the victim's IP address. The DNS servers then send the response to the victim, which can overwhelm the victim's network with the volume of responses.
b. This statement is not entirely true because it refers to egress filtering, which is the filtering of outbound traffic. While egress filtering can help to prevent a network's own systems from being used to perform attacks, it is ingress filtering that directly prevents spoofed packets from entering a network. Therefore, egress filtering alone would not prevent DNS reflection attacks, as these attacks rely on the attacker being able to spoof the source IP address of the DNS request, which would be addressed by ingress filtering, not egress filtering.","['https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-004', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2827', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/syn-flood-ddos-attack/', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/dns-amplification-ddos-attack/']",0,1_SDN_Basics,1,0.9843652200350328
