95,What are some benefits to using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Host configuration is simpler, since all hosts are visible from a single large Ethernet topology.
b. Forwarding on physical MAC addresses is simpler, since both the data center network topology and hosts' physical MAC addresses are hierarchical.
c. IP routing does not need to be reconfigured when physical or virtual machines move from one part of the network to another.
d. Scaling problems are simpler, since all hosts are configured on a single, flat topology.
e. Load balancing is easier on a layer-2 topology than on a layer 3 topology.
",,"a,c","a,c,d",,"Using a layer-2 MAC topology in a data center can offer several benefits. Option (a) is correct because in a layer-2 network, host configuration can be simpler due to the flat nature of the network where all hosts appear to be on the same local network segment. Option (c) is correct because, in a layer-2 network, IP routing does not need to be reconfigured when machines move around within the network since they maintain the same IP address and MAC address regardless of their physical or virtual location. Option (d) is correct because scaling can be simpler in a flat network topology since all hosts are part of the same broadcast domain. However, it should be noted that this can also introduce scalability issues due to the size of the broadcast domain. Option (b) is incorrect because MAC addresses are not hierarchical; they are flat and unique identifiers assigned to network interfaces. Option (e) is incorrect because load balancing can be performed on both layer-2 and layer-3 topologies, and the ease of implementation depends on the specific load balancing techniques and network design, rather than the layer of the network.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/what-is-a-layer-2-switch.html', 'https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/concept/layer-2-services-overview.html', 'https://www.networkworld.com/article/2224729/why-flat-networks-are-good.html']",0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,0.9976238743598606
96,"In PortLand, what are the reasons for assigning hosts pseudo-MAC addresses, as opposed to simply forwarding traffic on physical MAC addresses? Select all that apply.","a. Hosts in the data-center network topology are more vulnerable to attack if they expose their actual physical MAC addresses, rather than having a layer of indirection.
b. It is very difficult to load balance traffic using physical MAC addresses; pseudo MAC addresses make it possible to assign traffic to destination IP addresses.
c. Without pseudo-MAC addresses, switches would have to update forwarding state whenever hosts with a particular MAC address moved from one portion of the topology to another.
d. Forwarding loops are be more common in a flat layer-2 topology than they are in a topology with hierarchical pseudo MAC addresses.
e. In a flat layer-2 topology, switches cannot know on which port to forward traffic without maintaining switch tables for each MAC address, since MAC addresses are flat, not hierarchical.
",,"c,e","c,e",,"PortLand is a proposed data center network architecture that aims to combine the benefits of both flat and hierarchical topologies by using pseudo MAC addresses for hosts within the network. The use of pseudo-MAC addresses addresses several issues inherent in large-scale data center network topologies:

- With physical MAC addresses, switches must indeed update their forwarding state whenever a host moves, which can be cumbersome and inefficient in a dynamic data center environment. Pseudo-MAC addresses abstract the physical location of the host, making mobility more seamless (c).

- In a flat layer-2 network, the lack of hierarchy in MAC addresses means that switches must maintain large forwarding tables, which is not scalable. Pseudo-MAC addresses introduce a form of hierarchy that can simplify the process of determining on which port to forward traffic (e).

The other options are not directly related to the benefits of using pseudo-MAC addresses in the PortLand architecture:

- Hosts are not necessarily more vulnerable to attacks based on their MAC addresses being exposed (a).

- Load balancing can be achieved through various means and is not inherently tied to the use of physical or pseudo MAC addresses (b).

- Forwarding loops are a concern in layer-2 networks, but the use of pseudo-MAC addresses is not specifically aimed at preventing them; rather, it's the overall design of the PortLand architecture that aims to eliminate loops (d).","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1592568.1592575', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking']",1,13_SDN_use_cases,0.95,0.4740983639188369
97,What are the steps involved in the Proxy ARP process that PortLand's Fabric Manager runs?,"a. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns returns PMAC directly to the end host.
b. Edge switch sends ARP query to fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch updates its local PMAC mapping table.
c. Host sends ARP query, fabric manager intercepts ARP query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to end host.
d. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to the host.
e. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch returns PMAC to end host.
",,e,e,,"In the Proxy ARP process used by PortLand's Fabric Manager, when a host sends an ARP query for another host within the same subnet, the edge switch intercepts the ARP query. Instead of broadcasting this query to all ports, the edge switch forwards the query to the Fabric Manager. The Fabric Manager then looks up the Physical MAC (PMAC) address associated with the IP address in the query from its PMAC mapping table. Once the Fabric Manager has the PMAC, it sends this information back to the edge switch. The edge switch, in turn, updates its local PMAC mapping table and sends the PMAC back to the end host that originated the ARP query. This process helps in reducing ARP traffic within the network and allows the Fabric Manager to maintain a central repository of PMAC to IP address mappings.","['https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/nsdi09/tech/full_papers/niranjan_mysore/niranjan_mysore.pdf', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking']",1,13_SDN_use_cases,0.95,0.9569718431096526
98,"What are some of the disadvantages of today's interdomain routing protocol, BGP? Select all that apply.","a. ISPs cannot load-balance traffic across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix.
b. Routing and forwarding decisions are only based on IP prefix, not on a broader range of traffic flow attributes.
c. ISPs can only influence route selection through indirect mechanisms (e.g., prepending), rather than directly manipulating the forwarding table entries in switches.
d. ISPs cannot express preference of one route over another, given multiple routes to a destination.
e. ISPs can only influence the routing decisions of their immediate neighbor, not the entire end-to-end path.
",,"b,c,e","b,c,e",,"The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the de facto interdomain routing protocol that enables Autonomous Systems (ASes) to exchange routing information. While BGP is a robust protocol that has scaled with the internet, it does have several disadvantages. Option (b) is correct because BGP makes routing decisions based primarily on IP prefixes and path attributes, rather than considering a broader range of traffic flow attributes such as application type or quality of service requirements. Option (c) is correct because ISPs can influence route selection through mechanisms like AS path prepending or selective advertisement of routes, but they cannot directly change forwarding tables in other autonomous systems' routers. Option (e) is correct because BGP allows an ISP to influence routing decisions with its immediate BGP neighbors through BGP advertisements, but it does not have control over the entire end-to-end path across multiple ASes. Option (a) is incorrect because BGP does support multipath routing, allowing ISPs to load-balance traffic across multiple routes.

b. Application-specific peering
c. Wide-area load balancing using DNS-based redirection
d. On-the-fly redirection to middleboxes
e. Wide-area load balancing using IP packet rewriting
",,"b,d,e","a,b,d,e",,"Software Defined Exchanges (SDXs) enable advanced features that traditional Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) cannot support due to their static nature. SDXs, leveraging Software Defined Networking (SDN) principles, allow for more flexible and programmable network management. Here's why the selected options are features enabled by an SDX: (a) SDXs can support different business relationships, including regional peering arrangements, because of their ability to apply policies dynamically. (b) Application-specific peering is possible through SDXs as they can match traffic flows to specific applications and enforce corresponding peering policies. (d) SDXs can redirect traffic to middleboxes (like firewalls, load balancers, etc.) on-the-fly based on real-time network conditions or policies. (e) SDXs can perform wide-area load balancing using IP packet rewriting, allowing traffic to be distributed across multiple servers or paths based on current network status or application requirements.

103,What are some of the motivations for applying software defined networking in home networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Better performance, since control decisions can be made from a well-provisioned server, as opposed to an under-provisioned router.
b. Ability to better user interfaces to control home network behavior, independent of the interfaces that ship with home router devices.
c. Ability to allow multiple service providers access to the home network infrastructure for different applications and services.

e. More fine-grained control over the forwarding behavior of individual devices as conditions in the network change (e.g., a device uses too much bandwidth or data).
",,"b,c,d,e","a,b,c,e",,"Software Defined Networking (SDN) in home networks can offer several benefits, including: 

a. Better performance: SDN can centralize control decisions to a powerful server rather than relying on less capable hardware like a traditional router. 

b. Improved user interfaces: SDN enables the development of better user interfaces for managing home networks, which can be more user-friendly and feature-rich compared to the default interfaces on routers. 

c. Service provider access: SDN can allow different service providers to access the home network infrastructure to deliver various applications and services, making it easier to manage and provision these services. 

e. Fine-grained control: SDN provides the ability to dynamically adjust the network's forwarding behavior based on changing conditions, such as a device consuming excessive bandwidth.
