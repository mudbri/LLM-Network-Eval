179,"When APs are placed at different geographic locations, they can all be interconnected by a switched infrastructure. The 802.11 standard calls this an extended service set (ESS).","a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",,a,a,,"An Extended Service Set (ESS) is a set of two or more Basic Service Sets (BSSs) that form a single subnetwork. Access Points (APs) in an ESS are connected by a distribution system, which is typically a wired LAN. This allows users to roam seamlessly within the geographic area covered by the APs while maintaining a continuous connection to the network. Therefore, the statement is true.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless-mobility/wireless-lan-wlan/116056-technote-product-00.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_set_(802.11_network)']",1,chapter10_wireless_networks,0.95,0.9999962302846054
