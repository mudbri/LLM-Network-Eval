",,"a,d","b,e",,"For a Class B network, the default subnet mask is 255.255.0.0, which is equivalent to /16. To support 90 subnets, you would need at least 7 bits for subnetting (since 2^7 = 128, which is the smallest power of 2 greater than 90). Adding 7 bits for subnetting to the default 16 bits for Class B gives us 23 bits for the subnet mask. Therefore, a /21 subnet mask (which provides 5 bits for hosts within each subnet) and a mask of 255.255.248.0 (which is equivalent to /21) would both provide enough subnet bits to support 90 subnets. However, the option e is 255.255.240.0, which is equivalent to /20 and provides even more subnets (2^12 subnets). Therefore, the correct answers are /21 and 255.255.240.0, which are b and e respectively.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html', 'https://www.ripe.net/about-us/press-centre/understanding-ip-addressing']",0,chapter4_advanced_ipv4_addressing,0.95,0.4803014266426642

In a Class A address, the default subnet mask is 255.0.0.0, which means by default, there are 8 network bits. However, the subnet mask given is 255.255.255.0, which is a subnetted mask. This means that the first three octets (255.255.255) are used for network and subnetting purposes, which totals 24 bits, and the last octet (0) is used for host addresses, which is 8 bits.
