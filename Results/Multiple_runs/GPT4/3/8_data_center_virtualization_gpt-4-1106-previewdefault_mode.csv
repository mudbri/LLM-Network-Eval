62,Which of the following are true of “network slicing”? Select all that apply.,"a. Network operators can use slicing to test configurations on “shadow” networks that mirror a production network topology.
b. One way to slice networks is according to “flow space”, whereby different controllers might control distinct and non-overlapping traffic flows.
c. A controller can prevent one network slice from interfering with the resources of another.
d. Multi-tenant datacenters are one use case for network slicing.
e. Conventional (i.e., non-SDN) networks have no concept of network virtualization or slicing.
",,"a,b,d","a,b,c,d",,"Network slicing is a concept that allows multiple virtual networks to be created atop a shared physical infrastructure. Here's why the selected options are correct: 

a. Network operators can indeed use slicing to create 'shadow' networks for testing purposes without impacting the production network. 

b. Slicing networks according to 'flow space' is a valid approach in SDN, where different controllers manage distinct traffic flows, ensuring that they are kept separate. 

c. Controllers in SDN can enforce policies that prevent one network slice from consuming resources that would interfere with another, maintaining the integrity of each slice. 

d. Multi-tenant datacenters can benefit from network slicing by providing isolated network environments for different tenants on the same physical infrastructure. 

e. The statement that conventional networks have no concept of network virtualization or slicing is false. Traditional networks can also employ virtualization techniques, such as VLANs, MPLS, and VRFs, to create isolated network segments.","['https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-the-definition-of-network-slicing/', 'https://www.juniper.net/us/en/research-topics/what-is-network-slicing.html', 'https://www.networkworld.com/article/3236495/what-is-a-virtual-lan-how-vlans-work-and-why-vlans.html']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.95,0.999955672400997
63,Which of the following are true about flow spaces? Select all that apply.,"a. Two flow spaces cannot overlap.
b. One host could send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces.
c. Flow spaces can only be defined according to combinations of packet header fields.
d. Flowspace isolation separates individual virtual networks from one another but incurs some performance penalty for doing so.
e. Two controllers that write data-plane rules for non-overlapping parts of flowspace can never cause traffic from one “slice” to enter the other slice.
",,b,"b,c,d",,"Flow spaces in Software Defined Networking (SDN) are defined by a combination of packet header fields such as source and destination IP addresses, transport protocol, and port numbers. These definitions allow for the classification and control of network traffic within a software-defined network. Here's the analysis of each statement:

a. This statement is false because flow spaces can overlap. When they do, specific policies determine the handling of packets that match multiple flow spaces.

b. This statement is true. A single host can send different types of traffic that match the criteria for different flow spaces. For example, web traffic may fall into one flow space, while SSH traffic may fall into another.

c. This statement is true. Flow spaces are indeed defined according to combinations of packet header fields. These combinations are used to identify and manage network flows.

d. This statement is true. Flowspace isolation is a technique used to separate virtual networks. While it provides isolation and can enhance security, it may introduce a performance penalty due to the additional processing required to enforce the isolation.

e. This statement is false. Even if two controllers are managing non-overlapping parts of the flowspace, misconfigurations or specific network conditions could potentially cause traffic to cross from one slice into another. There is no absolute guarantee that traffic will remain entirely within one slice without proper configuration and enforcement mechanisms.","['https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/flow-space', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6602305', 'https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261359572_FlowVisor_A_Network_Virtualization_Layer']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.95,0.5171060054031082
64,Which of the following describe the control-plane checks that FlowVisor implements? Select all that apply.,"a. When a packet must be forwarded to a controller, Flowvisor forwards traffic to the correct controller based on which controller “owns” the flowspace corresponding to that packet.
b. Flowvisor prevents each slice's controller from being the target of a denial of service attack from other slices.
c. Flowvisor can only instantiate network slices based on the network topology, not based on other properties, such as application traffic.
d. Flowvisor prevents a controller from writing data-plane rules to a part of flowspace that it does not own.
e. Flowvisor installs traffic shaping and quality of service rules to ensure that each network slice has guaranteed resources.
",,"a,d","a,d",,"FlowVisor is a special purpose OpenFlow controller that acts as a transparent proxy between OpenFlow switches and multiple OpenFlow controllers. It creates network slices by dividing the traffic among various controllers. Option (a) is correct because FlowVisor does forward traffic to the correct controller based on the flowspace rules it has defined for each slice. Option (d) is also correct because FlowVisor enforces isolation among slices by ensuring that a controller can only write rules to the flowspace it owns, preventing it from affecting other slices. Option (b) is incorrect because FlowVisor's primary role is to manage the flowspace and not to provide security features such as preventing denial of service attacks on controllers. Option (c) is incorrect because FlowVisor can instantiate network slices based on various properties, including but not limited to the network topology, traffic type, and application requirements. Option (e) is incorrect because while FlowVisor can enforce traffic shaping policies, it does not inherently install quality of service rules; this is typically managed by the network administrators or the controllers themselves.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/cs-flowvisor.pdf', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915003439', 'https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261149586_FlowVisor_A_Network_Virtualization_Layer']",1,8_data_center_virtualization,0.95,0.9997129610535632
65,Which of the following are applications in a home network that network slicing could enable? Select all that apply.,"a. Quality of service for certain applications (e.g., video streaming)
b. Traceback of attack traffic to its source
c. Smart grid applications
d. Load balance of inbound traffic
e. Guest WiFi access
",,"a,c,e","a,c,e",,"Network slicing allows for the creation of multiple virtual networks on a common physical infrastructure. Each slice can be tailored to meet specific requirements. In a home network context, 'a' is correct because network slicing can prioritize traffic for applications like video streaming to ensure quality of service. 'c' is correct because smart grid applications can benefit from a dedicated network slice that ensures the reliability and low latency required for energy distribution management. 'e' is correct because guest WiFi access can be provided on a separate slice to enhance security and manage bandwidth allocation without affecting the primary network. 'b' is not typically a function of network slicing, as traceback of attack traffic is more related to security forensics and networking monitoring tools. 'd' refers to load balancing of inbound traffic, which is a broader network management task not specific to network slicing.","['https://www.ericsson.com/en/network-slicing', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-the-definition-of-network-slicing/']",1,8_data_center_virtualization,0.95,0.9992908940645306

70,What best describes the relationship between network virtualization and SDN? Select all that apply.,"a. SDN controllers can help manage storage and data facilities, in addition to network configuration
b. SDN predates network virtualization
c. Network virtualization requires SDN
d. SDN makes some aspects of network virtualization easier to manage
e. Network virtualization enables SDN

e. In NVP, most of the “intelligence” for datapath processing lies in virtual hosts, not in switches.
",,"a,e","a,c,e",,"NVP, or Network Virtualization Platform, is designed to allow for flexible management of virtual networks.
