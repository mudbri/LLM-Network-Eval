137,"In a spoofing attack, which of the following parameters are commonly spoofed? (Choose two answers)","a. Source IP address
b. MAC address
c. ARP address
d. Routing table
e. Destination IP address
f. ARP table
",,"a,b","a,b",,"In a spoofing attack, attackers commonly spoof the source IP address and the MAC address. Spoofing the source IP address can make traffic appear to come from a trusted source, bypassing security measures. MAC address spoofing can be used to impersonate another device on the local network, allowing the attacker to intercept data or create a denial of service. ARP spoofing is a type of attack that involves sending falsified ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages over a local area network, which can lead to the linking of an attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network (also known as ARP poisoning). While ARP spoofing attacks the ARP table, the term 'ARP address' is not commonly used in networking. The routing table and destination IP address are not typically parameters that are spoofed; rather, they are used or manipulated in the course of an attack.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address_spoofing', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_spoofing', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing']",1,chapter8_security_fundamentals,0.95,0.9566306484792544
