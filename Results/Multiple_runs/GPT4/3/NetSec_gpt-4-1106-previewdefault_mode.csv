d. policy NAT
e. dynamic NAT
",,d,d,,"Policy NAT (also known as Policy-based NAT) allows the implementation of NAT rules based on certain criteria such as the source or destination address, or even based on specific types of traffic.

2,Which form of NAT uses port addresses to distinguish between translated sessions? Select one choice.,"a. static NAT
b. policy NAT
c. dynamic PAT
d. dynamic NAT
",,c,c,,"Port Address Translation (PAT), also known as NAT overload, uses unique source port numbers on the inside global IP address to distinguish between translations. This allows multiple internal hosts to share a single external IP address but uses different port numbers to keep the sessions separate. Static NAT provides a one-to-one mapping between an internal and external address, which does not involve ports for session distinction. Dynamic NAT also provides a one-to-one mapping but from a pool of addresses without involving ports to distinguish sessions. Policy NAT is a form of NAT where the translation process takes into account the transmission policy before performing the NAT operation; it does not inherently use port addresses to distinguish between sessions.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/network-address-translation-nat/4606-8.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation']",1,NetSec,1,0.9999994487765019

d. Ping of death
",,b,b,,"Attackers use malware that is controlled through Command and Control (CnC) servers to launch attacks on a target without the attack coming directly from the attacker's location. This allows the attacker to control the malware remotely, often through a network of compromised computers known as a botnet, to execute the attack and avoid detection.","['https://www.imperva.com/learn/ddos/botnet-ddos/', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/command-control.html']",1,NetSec,0.95,0.9999995679800934
32,Which TCP/IP application protocol can be used in an amplification attack by exploiting the protocol weakness in recursive lookup? Select one choice.,"a. HTTPS
b. LDAP
c. HTTP
d. DNS
e. SMTP
",,d,d,,"DNS (Domain Name System) is known to be exploitable in amplification attacks due to its recursive lookup feature. Attackers can use DNS servers to amplify the volume of data sent to a target server, overwhelming it with traffic. This is done by making small query requests that result in much larger responses being sent to the spoofed IP address of the victim. This is not a characteristic of HTTPS, HTTP, LDAP, or SMTP, which are not typically used in amplification attacks in the same way.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/dns-amplification-ddos-attack/', 'https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-088A']",1,NetSec,0.95,0.9998402164567504
33,Which type of attack forces a machine to respond to a SYN message by sending a packet to itself on the same port it received the SYN? Select one choice.,"a. Smurf
b. Land attack
c. Amplification attack
d. Reflection attack
",,b,b,,"A Land attack is a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack that sends a special spoofed packet to a computer, causing it to reply to itself continuously. This attack exploits a vulnerability in the way that TCP/IP connections are established. In a Land attack, the attacker sends a SYN packet (used to initiate a TCP connection) with the same source and destination IP address and port number to a victim's machine. When the victim's machine receives this packet, it tries to respond to itself, which can result in a crash or a significant slowdown.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAND', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/syn-flood-ddos-attack/']",1,NetSec,0.95,1.0
34,A Layer 2 redirect or spoofing attack can be referred to as what type of attack? Select one choice.,"a. ARP attack
b. DHCP attack
c. NetBios attack
d. SSID attack
",,a,a,,"A Layer 2 redirect or spoofing attack that targets the resolution of IP addresses to MAC addresses is known as an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) attack. ARP attacks can take the form of ARP spoofing, where an attacker sends falsified ARP messages over a local area network to link their MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network. This allows the attacker to intercept, modify, or stop data intended for that IP address.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/arp-spoofing.html']",1,NetSec,0.95,0.9999978991308068
35,Which one of the following options is the illegitimate DHCP server that is referred to in the context of a DHCP server-based attack? Select one choice.,"a. A sitting duck server
b. A rogue DHCP server
c. A target server
d. An erroneous server
",,b,b,,"In the context of DHCP server-based attacks, a 'rogue DHCP server' refers to an unauthorized DHCP server on the network. This server is not under the control of network administrators and may provide clients with incorrect IP addresses or other network information, leading to attacks such as man-in-the-middle or denial of service.",['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/dynamic-address-allocation-resolution/113336-rogue-dhcp.html'],1,NetSec,1,1.0

b. MAC address security
c. DHCP snooping
d. DHCP authentication""
",,c,c,,DHCP snooping is a security feature that acts as a firewall between untrusted hosts and trusted DHCP servers. It filters untrusted DHCP messages and can be used to mitigate DHCP spoofing attacks by building and maintaining a table of valid IP address/MAC address bindings. This feature protects against malicious attacks such as DHCP starvation or rogue DHCP server attacks.,"['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12-2SX/configuration/guide/book/snoodhcp.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/dynamic-address-allocation-resolution/27470-100.html']",1,NetSec,1,1.0
