1,Which of the following terms describe Ethernet addresses that can send one frame and is delivered to multiple devices on the LAN? (Choose two answers.),"a. Broadcast address
b. Multicast address
c. IP address
d. MAC address
e. Unicast address
",,"a,b","a,b",,"In Ethernet networking, a broadcast address is used to send a frame to all devices on the local area network (LAN). This is typically represented by an address of all ones (FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF in hexadecimal for MAC addresses). A multicast address, on the other hand, is used to send a frame to a group of devices on the LAN that have been configured to listen for transmissions sent to that specific address. IP addresses are used at the network layer to identify devices on a network, but they are not specifically used to describe the type of delivery in the context of this question. MAC addresses are unique identifiers for network interfaces, but the term 'MAC address' by itself does not imply a type of delivery. Unicast addresses are used to send a frame to a single device on the network.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/smb/switches/cisco-200-series-smart-switches/smb1123-how-to-configure-ipv4-multicast-routing.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_address', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_address']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,1,0.9999995679800934

b. Switch and PC
c. Hub and switch
d. Router and hub
",,"b,d","b,d",,"In Ethernet networking, the type of cable used for connecting devices depends on the type of devices being connected.

This is because these devices typically have different wiring configurations, with one using the MDI (Media Dependent Interface) standard and the other using MDI-X (Media Dependent Interface Crossover). Since a switch and a PC fall into different categories (one is an end device and the other is a networking device), they require a straight-through cable. Similarly, a router and a hub also require a straight-through cable because a hub is considered a passive device, while a router is an active networking device.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/smb/routers/cisco-rv-series-small-business-routers/smb4284-types-of-network-cables-and-network-cable-connectors.html', 'https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/straight-through-cable.htm']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,0.95,0.4484950205488961

d. Forwarding IP packets based on a packet’s destination IP address
",,"a,b","a,b",,"Routing protocols have two main functions: learning routes from other routers and advertising routes to other routers. Option 'a' is correct because routing protocols learn routes from advertisements sent by neighboring routers and then place those routes in the routing table. Option 'b' is also correct as routing protocols advertise known routes to neighboring routers to inform them of networks that can be reached through the advertising router. Option 'c' is not a function of routing protocols because the router learns routes for directly connected subnets through its own interface configuration, not through a routing protocol. Option 'd' is the function of the routing process, not the routing protocol itself.
