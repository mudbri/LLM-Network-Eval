25,What could be the operational steps behind the AT&T's IRSCP (a commercial version of the Routing Control Platform) for detecting malicious traffic? Select all that apply.,"a. The controller sees all traffic passing through the network, detects an attack, and installs a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where the attack traffic is originating.
b. The end host changes its IP address so that it is no longer the target of the attack traffic.
c. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to re-route traffic through a deep-packet inspection device.
d. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to install a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where attack traffic is originating.
e. A victim end host sends an alert to an on-path firewall about the source and nature of an attack, at which point the firewall installs a null route to drop the traffic at the entry point where the attack is originating.
",,"c,d","a,c,d",,"AT&T's IRSCP (Integrated Routing and Service Control Point) is designed to enhance network control and security. Given the options, the following could be operational steps in detecting and mitigating malicious traffic within such a system: 

a. The controller having visibility of all network traffic is a key feature of SDN (Software Defined Networking), allowing it to detect attacks and install null routes to prevent the attack traffic from flowing through the network. 

c. A measurement system detecting an attack and instructing a controller to reroute traffic for further inspection is a plausible step, as it involves the detection and subsequent action to mitigate the attack. Deep-packet inspection devices are commonly used for more detailed analysis of traffic, which is consistent with the principles of SDN where network control is centralized and programmable. 

d. Similar to option a, a measurement system could detect an attack and identify the entry point, after which a controller could install a null route to drop attack traffic. This is a common approach to quickly mitigate attacks by stopping malicious traffic at the network's edge. 

Options b and e are less likely to be operational steps in AT&T's IRSCP. Changing an end host's IP address (b) is not a scalable or practical solution for a network controller dealing with high volumes of traffic, and it does not involve the controller's active participation in mitigating the attack. Option e suggests that an end host directly communicates with a firewall, which does not align with the centralized control mechanism of an SDN system where the controller would typically manage such security measures.","['https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/whats-software-defined-networking/', 'https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221516875_Software_Defined_Networking', 'https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi14/nsdi14-paper-gember-jacobson.pdf']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.9,0.9570871722034677

c. Better security properties.
d. Better scaling properties.
e. Better load balancing properties.
",,b,"b,d,e",,"Layer-2 forwarding in a data center is often motivated by several factors: b) Easier configuration/administration is a key motivation because Layer-2 networks do not require the configuration of IP addresses and subnets for the devices connected to the network, which simplifies the setup process. d) Better scaling properties are also a motivation since Layer-2 forwarding can handle a large number of hosts within the same broadcast domain, and the use of technologies like VXLAN can extend Layer-2 networks over Layer-3 infrastructures. e) Better load balancing properties can be achieved at Layer-2 with the use of multiple paths and techniques like Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routing, which can distribute traffic across multiple network paths. However, a) is incorrect because Layer-2 forwarding uses MAC addresses, not IP routing protocols, to establish paths between hosts. c) is not necessarily correct as Layer-2 networks can be less secure due to the potential for broadcast storms and the lack of inherent segmentation offered by Layer-3 networks.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/sw/design/vxlan_design/vxlan_design_guide.html', 'https://www.networkworld.com/article/2224729/what-is-layer-2-and-layer-3-in-networking-.html', 'https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/evpn-vxlan/topics/topic-map/evpn-vxlan-load-balancing.html']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.95,0.9288852365265818
28,How does the separation of the control and data plane make networking in data centers easier?,"a. Virtual machines can be migrated within the network without renumbering entire portions of the network or re-assigning network services to different IP addresses.
b. The control plane allows traffic to be forwarded using Layer 2 addresses, thus allowing automatic load balance across the topology.
c. The separation allows fewer switches to be used in the data center topology, thus lowering costs.
d. All routes can be controlled and monitored from a central point of control.
e. A network controller can permit the renumbering of end hosts to have topology-dependent Layer 2 MAC addresses.

Option (a) is correct because with a centralized control plane, virtual machines can be migrated seamlessly without the need for renumbering or re-assigning network services, as the SDN controller can dynamically update the network configuration. Option (d) is also correct because having a central point of control allows for centralized routing decisions and monitoring, which simplifies network management. Option (b) is incorrect because the control plane does not forward traffic based on Layer 2 addresses; that is the function of the data plane.

Incorrect operation when one controller fails (d) can happen if the failover mechanisms are not properly synchronized. Forwarding loops (e) can be created if inconsistent or out-of-sync routing information is propagated by the controllers.

b. Keeping a ""hot spare"" replica that has a complete view of the network state.
c. Only keeping a subset of the network state in memory at any time.
d. Using different controllers for independent parts of the network.
e. Having multiple controllers install forwarding table entries on the same router and resolving the conflict on the router itself.
",,"a,b,c,d","a,b,d",,"In the context of Software Defined Networking (SDN), consistency across controller replicas is important to ensure that the network operates correctly and efficiently. Here's why the selected options are valid approaches to maintaining consistency across controller replicas: 

a. Running a consistency protocol across controller replicas is a standard approach to ensure that all replicas have the same view of the network state. This could be achieved through consensus algorithms like Raft or Paxos.

b. Keeping a 'hot spare' replica means that there is a fully updated backup controller ready to take over in case the primary controller fails. This helps in maintaining a consistent network state during failovers.

d. Using different controllers for independent parts of the network can help in reducing the complexity of maintaining consistency because each controller is responsible for a smaller, manageable portion of the network, and inconsistencies are less likely to propagate across the entire network.

Option c is not an approach to coping with inconsistency; it could actually introduce inconsistency if not managed properly. Option e is also not a typical approach to handling inconsistency, as resolving conflicts on the router itself can be complex and might not align with the centralized control plane paradigm of SDN.","['https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6602306', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140366416301820', 'https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303383214_Software_Defined_Networking_A_Comprehensive_Survey']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.95,0.774775182106906

b. Only performing control-plane operations for a limited set of network operations.
c. Eliminating redundant data structures.
d. Sending all traffic through the controller to minimize forwarding decisions that the routers and switches must make.
e. Running multiple controllers, and having each controller only manage a part of the network.
",,"a,b,c,e","a,b,c,e",,"Scalability is a significant concern in Software Defined Networking (SDN) due to the centralization of the control plane. Here are the reasons for choosing the given options: 

a. Caching forwarding decisions in the data plane can indeed reduce the control plane's load as switches and routers can handle packets locally according to the cached rules without querying the controller for each new flow. 

b. Limiting control-plane operations to a subset of network functions can help in reducing the load on the controller and hence improve scalability. 

c. Eliminating redundant data structures can optimize memory usage and processing time, contributing to better scalability. 

e. Using multiple controllers, each managing a different segment of the network, is a common approach to scale SDN architectures. This method, known as distributed control, allows for horizontal scaling of the network control plane. 

d. Sending all traffic through the controller is not a scalability solution; in fact, it would create a bottleneck and is contrary to the principle of SDN where the data plane should handle forwarding decisions once the rules are set by the control plane.","['https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/software-defined-networking', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-the-definition-of-software-defined-networking-sdn/', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6602305']",1,4_control_and_data_separation,0.95,0.4038950265727382
32,"Which property guarantees that each RCP replica continues to install correct forwarding state in the network data plane, even in the case of a partition in the data plane?","a. Each controller has a complete view of the portion of the network that it is controlling, and therefore can guarantee consistent routing within that partition.
b. The controller cannot see many of the routers in the network anyway, so there is no way for it to install incorrect routing state in the routers that it is not connected to.
c. The controllers are partitioned from the network routers, and the routers will fall back to running a distributed routing protocol.
d. Running the network from a single high-level control plane guarantees that network partitions and loops never occur in the first place.
",,a,a,,"The property described in the question is related to the ability of a Software Defined Networking (SDN) controller to maintain a consistent view of the network, or at least the portion it controls, despite network partitions. Option 'a' is correct because if each controller maintains a complete and accurate view of its controlling partition, it can ensure that the forwarding state it installs is consistent within that partition. This does not mean that the controller can prevent or resolve partitions, but it can maintain correct operation within its scope of control. The other options either misunderstand the capabilities of SDN controllers ('b' and 'd') or describe a fallback to traditional distributed routing rather than a property of the controller itself ('c').","['Open Networking Foundation.
