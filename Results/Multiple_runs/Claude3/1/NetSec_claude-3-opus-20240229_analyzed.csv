",,d,d,,"The Domain Name System (DNS) protocol can be exploited in an amplification attack by abusing its recursive lookup feature. In a DNS amplification attack, the attacker sends DNS lookup requests to open DNS resolvers with the source IP spoofed to be the target's IP. The DNS servers then send their responses to the target. By crafting the requests to elicit a much larger response than the request itself, the attacker can overwhelm the target with a flood of traffic. The other protocols listed (HTTPS, LDAP, HTTP, SMTP) are not as susceptible to amplification attacks in this manner.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/dns-amplification-ddos-attack/', 'https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-088A', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Amplification']",1,NetSec,0.95,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
33,Which type of attack forces a machine to respond to a SYN message by sending a packet to itself on the same port it received the SYN? Select one choice.,"a. Smurf
b. Land attack
c. Amplification attack
d. Reflection attack
",,b,b,,"A land attack involves sending a SYN packet to a target machine with the source IP spoofed to be the same as the target IP. The target machine then responds to the SYN by sending a SYN-ACK to itself on the same port it received the original SYN. This causes the machine to get stuck in a loop responding to itself, consuming resources.","['CISSP All-in-One Exam Guide, 8th Edition by Shon Harris and Fernando Maymi', 'https://www.imperva.com/learn/ddos/land-attack/']",1,NetSec,0.95,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
34,A Layer 2 redirect or spoofing attack can be referred to as what type of attack? Select one choice.,"a. ARP attack
b. DHCP attack
c. NetBios attack
d. SSID attack
",,a,a,,"A Layer 2 redirect or spoofing attack is commonly referred to as an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) attack. In an ARP attack, the attacker sends falsified ARP messages over a local area network to associate their MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network. This allows the attacker to intercept, modify or block traffic intended for that IP address.","['CISCO: Understanding ARP Spoofing Attacks - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/switches/what-is-arp-spoofing.html', 'Imperva: Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Spoofing - https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/arp-spoofing/']",1,NetSec,0.95,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
35,Which one of the following options is the illegitimate DHCP server that is referred to in the context of a DHCP server-based attack? Select one choice.,"a. A sitting duck server
b. A rogue DHCP server
c. A target server
d. An erroneous server
",,b,b,,"In the context of a DHCP server-based attack, a rogue DHCP server is the illegitimate DHCP server. A rogue DHCP server is an unauthorized DHCP server on a network that can provide incorrect IP addressing and configuration information to DHCP clients, potentially redirecting them to malicious servers or causing network disruption.","['CISSP Study Guide by Eric Conrad, Seth Misenar, and Joshua Feldman (2015)', 'CompTIA Security+ SY0-601 Exam Cram by Diane Barrett and Martin Weiss (2021)']",1,NetSec,0.95,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

b. MAC address security
c. DHCP snooping
d. DHCP authentication""
",,c,c,,"DHCP snooping is a Cisco switch feature that can help mitigate DHCP attacks. It works by acting as a firewall between untrusted hosts and trusted DHCP servers. The switch builds and maintains a DHCP snooping binding database, which contains information about hosts with leased IP addresses. Incoming DHCP messages are filtered based on this database. This helps prevent malicious actors from attacking the DHCP server or attempting to exhaust the DHCP address pool.","['Cisco - Configuring DHCP Snooping (https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12-2SX/configuration/guide/book/snoodhcp.html)', 'Cisco Press - CCNP and CCIE Enterprise Core ENCOR 350-401 Official Cert Guide, Chapter 6: Securing Network Devices']",1,NetSec,0.95,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
