95,What are some benefits to using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Host configuration is simpler, since all hosts are visible from a single large Ethernet topology.
b. Forwarding on physical MAC addresses is simpler, since both the data center network topology and hosts' physical MAC addresses are hierarchical.
c. IP routing does not need to be reconfigured when physical or virtual machines move from one part of the network to another.
d. Scaling problems are simpler, since all hosts are configured on a single, flat topology.
e. Load balancing is easier on a layer-2 topology than on a layer 3 topology.",,"a,c","a,c",,"Using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center provides benefits in terms of simpler host configuration, since all hosts are visible on a single large Ethernet topology. This also means that IP routing does not need to be reconfigured when physical or virtual machines move within the network. However, forwarding based on physical MAC addresses is not necessarily simpler in a large flat topology compared to a hierarchical one. Scaling can also be more challenging with a single flat topology due to broadcast domains and MAC address table limitations. Load balancing is not inherently easier at layer-2 compared to layer-3.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-7000-series-switches/white_paper_c11-522337.html', 'https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/layer-2-switching/topics/concept/layer-2-switching-overview.html']",1,13_SDN_use_cases,0.8,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
96,"In PortLand, what are the reasons for assigning hosts pseudo-MAC addresses, as opposed to simply forwarding traffic on physical MAC addresses? Select all that apply.","a. Hosts in the data-center network topology are more vulnerable to attack if they expose their actual physical MAC addresses, rather than having a layer of indirection.
b. It is very difficult to load balance traffic using physical MAC addresses; pseudo MAC addresses make it possible to assign traffic to destination IP addresses.
c. Without pseudo-MAC addresses, switches would have to update forwarding state whenever hosts with a particular MAC address moved from one portion of the topology to another.
d. Forwarding loops are be more common in a flat layer-2 topology than they are in a topology with hierarchical pseudo MAC addresses.
e. In a flat layer-2 topology, switches cannot know on which port to forward traffic without maintaining switch tables for each MAC address, since MAC addresses are flat, not hierarchical.",,"c,e","c,e",,"Pseudo-MAC addresses are used in PortLand for two main reasons:1) Without pseudo-MAC addresses that encode location information, switches would need to update forwarding state whenever a host moves in the network, since the flat physical MAC addresses provide no information about location (c).  2) In a flat layer-2 topology using physical MAC addresses, switches cannot determine the appropriate outgoing port for a frame just by looking at the destination MAC address, since MAC addresses are flat.

97,What are the steps involved in the Proxy ARP process that PortLand's Fabric Manager runs?,"a. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns returns PMAC directly to the end host.
b. Edge switch sends ARP query to fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch updates its local PMAC mapping table.
c. Host sends ARP query, fabric manager intercepts ARP query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to end host.
d. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to the host.

",,e,e,,"In the PortLand architecture, the Proxy ARP process involves the following steps: (1) The host sends an ARP query to resolve the MAC address of the destination. (2) The edge switch intercepts this ARP query and redirects it to the fabric manager. (3) The fabric manager consults its PMAC (Pseudo MAC) mapping table to determine the PMAC address corresponding to the destination IP. (4) The fabric manager returns this PMAC address to the edge switch. (5) Finally, the edge switch sends the PMAC address back to the requesting host in an ARP reply.

b. Routing and forwarding decisions are only based on IP prefix, not on a broader range of traffic flow attributes.
c. ISPs can only influence route selection through indirect mechanisms (e.g., prepending), rather than directly manipulating the forwarding table entries in switches.
