43,Which of the following statements are true about the OpenFlow specification? Select all that apply.,"a. If a switch does not contain a flow table entry that matches a particular packet, the switch forwards the packet to the controller for handling.
b. The main purpose of the OpenFlow control channel is to update flow table entries on switches.
c. The OpenFlow specification provides mechanisms to perform Layer 2 learning across a network of switches.
d. Once a switch has sent one packet for a flow, it must also send all subsequent packets for that flow to the controller.
e. Some versions of the OpenFlow specification allow for performing more than one action on a single packet.",,"a,b,e","a,b,e",,"The correct statements about the OpenFlow specification are: a) If a switch does not have a matching flow entry for a packet, it sends the packet to the controller to determine how to handle it. b) The main purpose of the OpenFlow control channel is indeed to allow the controller to update flow table entries on the switches.  e) Later versions of OpenFlow (1.1+) introduced the ability to apply multiple actions to a single packet. Statement c is incorrect because Layer 2 learning is not part of the core OpenFlow spec. Statement d is false; after sending the first packet of a new flow to the controller, the controller can install a flow entry allowing the switch to forward subsequent packets without involving the controller.","['https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/openflow-switch-v1.5.1.pdf', 'https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/openflow-spec-v1.0.0.pdf']",1,6_control_plane,0.95,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
44,Which of the following statements are true about dpctl? Select all that apply.,"a. dpctl is invoked from within the Mininet emulator.
b. dpctl can modify flow table entries on an OpenFlow switch.

d. dpctl is an OpenFlow controller.
e. dpctl can inspect flow table entries on an OpenFlow switch.
",,"b,e","b,e",,"dpctl is a command line utility that can be used to inspect and modify flow table entries on an OpenFlow switch. It allows direct interaction with the switch's flow tables to add, delete or modify flow entries. However, dpctl itself is not an OpenFlow controller and does not respond to network events.

45,Which of the following are reasonable considerations for the choice of controller? Select all that apply.,"a. Performance of the programming language that the controller is implemented in.
b. Support for and integration with cloud applications.
c. Ease of learning curve.
d. Need for production-quality operation.
e. Speed of prototyping.
",,"a,b,c,d,e","a,b,c,d,e",,All of the listed considerations are reasonable when choosing an SDN controller. The performance of the programming language the controller is implemented in (a) impacts its speed and efficiency. Support for integration with cloud applications (b) is important for modern networks leveraging cloud services. Ease of learning curve (c) affects how quickly network operators can become proficient with the controller. The need for production-quality operation (d) is critical for enterprise deployments. Speed of prototyping (e) enables faster innovation and testing of new network functionality. So all the factors listed are valid considerations that may be prioritized differently based on an organization's specific requirements and use cases.,"['Software Defined Networks: A Comprehensive Approach by Paul Goransson and Chuck Black, Chapter 6 - SDN Controllers', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/sdn/definitions/sdn-controllers/', 'https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-definition/']",1,6_control_plane,0.95,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

47,Which of the following are true about Pox? Select all that apply.,"a. Pox automatically determines the order to install flow table rules, to avoid inconsistent forwarding behavior.
b. Pox's _handle_PacketIn function determines how a packet should be handled when it arrives at the controller.
c. Pox provides a function to modify flow table entries at a switch.
d. Pox's performance is typically slower than NOX.
e. Pox automatically determines the priority between two conflicting rules.
",,"b,c,d","b,c,d",,"Option b is correct because in Pox, the _handle_PacketIn function is called when a packet arrives at the controller and determines how it should be processed. Option c is correct as Pox provides an API to modify flow table entries on switches. Option d is also correct since Pox is implemented in Python which typically has slower performance compared to NOX which uses C++. Options a and e are incorrect because Pox does not automatically determine flow rule order or priority - this needs to be explicitly handled by the controller application.","['https://noxrepo.github.io/pox-doc/html/', 'https://github.com/att/pox', 'https://openflow.stanford.edu/display/ONL/POX+Wiki']",1,6_control_plane,0.9,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
48,What is the difference between a hard timeout and an idle timeout?,"a. A hard timeout occurs exactly at the specified interval, whereas an idle timeout may occur slightly later than the specified interval.
b. A hard timeout expunges a flow table entry regardless of whether there have been active matches, whereas an idle timeout expunges the flow table entry only if there have been no matches for that flow within the specified interval.
c. A hard timeout expunges all flow table entry from the switch, whereas an idle timeout only expunges one flow at a time.
d. A hard timeout expunges a flow table entry for all switches in the network, whereas an idle timeout only expunges the flow table entry on the switches that have seen no matches for that flow within the specified interval.
",,b,b,,"The key difference between a hard timeout and an idle timeout is that a hard timeout expunges a flow table entry after the specified time interval regardless of whether there have been active matches for that flow. In contrast, an idle timeout only expunges the flow table entry if there have been no matches for that specific flow within the specified time interval. So the hard timeout is based purely on the elapsed time, while the idle timeout takes into account the flow activity.","['Software Defined Networks: A Comprehensive Approach, Second Edition by Paul Goransson, Chuck Black', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-is-openflow/', 'https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/openflow-spec-v1.3.1.pdf']",1,6_control_plane,0.95,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

c. A learning switch implemented in Pox can be easily extended to support firewall capabilities.
d. A learning switch implemented in Pox requires all incoming packets to be redirected to the controller.

d. drop
