1,Which of the following are true about Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)? Select all that apply.,"a. The only sizes for an IP address allocation before CIDR were 8, 16, or 24 bits.
b. The prefix length for a CIDR prefix can be anywhere in the range from 0 to 32 bits.
c. In an Internet forwarding table with CIDR, there can only be one unique matching entry for any given IP address.
d. CIDR slowed the rate of Internet routing table growth because prefixes no longer had to be allocated in fixed-size blocks.
",,"b,d","b,d",,"CIDR allows for variable-length subnet masking, meaning the prefix length can be anywhere from 0 to 32 bits (choice b). This flexible allocation of IP address blocks helped slow the growth of Internet routing tables compared to the previous classful addressing scheme that only allowed fixed-size blocks of 8, 16, or 24 bits (eliminating the need for choice a to be selected). With CIDR, a routing table can contain multiple matching entries of different prefix lengths for a given IP address, with the longest matching prefix used for forwarding (making choice c incorrect).","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross, Section 4.1.3', 'RFC 4632: Classless Inter-domain Routing (CIDR): The Internet Address Assignment and Aggregation Plan']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
2,Which of the following are true about how DNS lookups work? Select all that apply.,"a. A DNS A-record query for google.com will only return a single IP address at a time.
b. An NS-record query for a DNS lookup will return the name(s) of the authoritative name server(s) for that domain.
c. If your local DNS resolver caches an NS record for google.com for multiple days, all clients who use that DNS resolver will continue using the same IP address to reach Google’s Web server until that NS record expires.
d. An MX-record query for a DNS lookup will return the IP address of the mail server for that domain.
e. All DNS PTR records are maintained by a single organization in-addr.arpa.
",,b,b,,"Only choice b is correct. An NS-record query returns the authoritative name server(s) for a domain. Choice a is incorrect because an A-record can return multiple IP addresses. Choice c is incorrect because NS records map to name servers, not IP addresses of web servers directly. Choice d is incorrect because MX records return the hostname of the mail server, not the IP address. Choice e is incorrect because PTR records are delegated to the owners of the IP address blocks.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/', 'https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
3,Which of the following are true about traffic control with BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
b. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
c. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
d. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
",,"a,b","a,c",,"A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control outbound traffic from their AS to a destination. The local preference is used to prefer certain paths to exit the AS. A higher local preference is preferred, so setting this on outbound routes can influence outbound path selection. BGP AS path prepending can also be used to control outbound traffic by making certain paths appear longer and less preferred. By prepending its own AS number multiple times to the AS path on certain outbound routes, an AS can make those paths less likely to be selected by other ASes, thus influencing outbound traffic patterns.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/13753-25.html', 'https://www.noction.com/blog/bgp-attributes-and-route-selection', 'https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/352/notes/bgp.html']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,1
4,Which of the following are true about layering? Select all that apply.,"a. The network layer guarantees reliable, in-order delivery of packets.
b. The network layer has only a single protocol in widespread use today, representing what we call the “narrow waist”.
c. The transport layer uses port numbers.
d. The destination address in the link layer header is always the address of the next layer-3 node along an end-to-end IP path.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"The network layer does not guarantee reliable, in-order delivery of packets (that is the responsibility of the transport layer if desired). The network layer does have a 'narrow waist' with IP being the single dominant protocol in use today. The transport layer uses port numbers to multiplex/demultiplex data to/from applications. The link layer destination address is the address of the next layer-2 hop, not necessarily the next layer-3 node along the end-to-end path.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross', 'TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols by W.

5,Which of the following are not true about packet switching? Select all that apply.,"a. Once a connection is established between two endpoints in a packet switched network, the end-to-end route cannot change, or the connection must be re-established.
b. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will always experience predictable latency.
c. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will never be dropped by intermediate nodes along the path.
d. A user of a packet switched network might occasionally get a “busy signal” if there are too many users on the network.
",,"a,b,c,d","a,b,c,d",,"All of the statements about packet switching are false:a) In a packet switched network, each packet is independently routed, so the end-to-end route can change without needing to re-establish the connection.  b) Latency in a packet switched network is not predictable as it depends on factors like network congestion which can vary.c) Packets can be dropped by intermediate nodes in a packet switched network if their buffers are full due to congestion.d) Packet switched networks do not have the concept of a 'busy signal'. If the network is congested, packets may be delayed or dropped, but new connections can still be established.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
6,Which of the following are true about content distribution networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Content distribution networks can improve the performance that a client sees by reducing the network latency between the client and the content that it is downloading.
b. Content distribution networks can reduce transit expenses for a content provider by enabling much of the provider’s content to be served from a nearby network, sometimes even from a cache that is within the client’s own network.
c. Real-time content such as video streams cannot be distributed from a content distribution network.
d. Content distribution networks typically redirect Web clients to a nearby Web cache by rewriting the IP address of packets sent from the client to the IP address of the nearby Web cache.
",,"a,b","a,b",,"Content distribution networks (CDNs) can improve client performance by reducing network latency, as the content is served from a nearby cache (a). CDNs also reduce transit costs for content providers by serving content from caches closer to the client, sometimes within the client's own network (b). Real-time content like video streams can be distributed via CDNs (c is incorrect). CDNs typically redirect clients to nearby caches by rewriting URLs using DNS, not by rewriting IP addresses in packets (d is incorrect).","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross, Section 2.4', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
7,Which of the following are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control? Select all that apply.,"a. Only wireless networks can have collisions at the receiver; such collisions are not possible on wired Ethernet networks.
b. Using RTS/CTS (“request to send”, “clear to send”) control reduces the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network.
c. A wireless sender can avoid causing a collision at the receiver by performing a “carrier sense” to determine whether any other sender wants to transmit at the time that it wishes to send a packet.
d. Disabling RTS/CTS necessarily lowers the effective throughput of the wireless network, since more collisions will occur at the receiver without RTS/CTS enabled.
",,b,"b,c",,Both options b and c are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control. Using RTS/CTS control frames introduces additional overhead which reduces the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network (b). A wireless sender can avoid causing collisions at the receiver by performing carrier sensing to determine if the medium is free before transmitting (c). Option a is false because collisions can occur on both wireless and wired Ethernet networks. Option d is incorrect as disabling RTS/CTS does not necessarily lower throughput since it depends on factors like network load and packet sizes.,"['802.11 Wireless Networks: The Definitive Guide, 2nd Edition by Matthew Gast', 'Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
8,Which of the following are true about video streaming? Select all that apply.,"a. Using UDP to stream a video instead of TCP is appropriate if the client is more concerned about low delay and interactivity than it does about receiving a high-quality stream.
b. A larger playout buffer at the client allows the client more time to recover from lost packets.
c. Using TCP for video streaming could result in larger delays between transmission and playout than streaming the same video with UDP.
d. Since UDP provides no reliable delivery guarantees, a video streaming application that uses UDP as its transport cannot recover from any packet loss in the video stream.
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"Using UDP for video streaming instead of TCP is appropriate if low delay and interactivity are prioritized over receiving a high-quality stream (a). A larger playout buffer at the client provides more time to recover from lost packets by allowing retransmission or error correction (b). TCP's reliable in-order delivery can introduce larger delays compared to UDP, which has no such guarantees (c). However, (d) is incorrect because UDP-based video streaming applications can employ techniques like error correction or selective retransmission to recover from some packet loss, even though UDP itself provides no reliability.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross, Section 7.3', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_Transport_Protocol']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
9,Which of the following are true about TCP? Select all that apply.,"a. TCP guarantees that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted.
b. A TCP sender and receiver use a “three-way handshake” both to set up and to terminate the TCP connection.
c. TCP’s congestion avoidance algorithm causes the sender to reduce its sending rate by a factor of two when it sees a packet loss.
d. A TCP sender controls its sending rate by adjusting the number of unacknowledged packets that can be sent over the network at any time.
",,"a,c,d","a,d",,"TCP provides reliable, in-order delivery of a stream of bytes from sender to receiver (a). It achieves this through sequence numbers, acknowledgements, and retransmissions. TCP uses a sliding window protocol where the sender adjusts its sending rate by controlling the number of unacknowledged packets in flight (d). The three-way handshake is only used for connection establishment, not termination (b is incorrect). TCP's congestion control reduces the sending rate more gradually using the additive increase/multiplicative decrease (AIMD) algorithm rather than always halving the rate on packet loss (c is incorrect).","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross, Section 3.5', 'TCP congestion control: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
10,Which of the following are true about denial of service attacks (and defenses)? Select all that apply.,"a. If every network on the Internet performed stateless ingress filtering to defend against source IP spoofing, the DNS reflection attack would not work.
b. If every network on the Internet performed stateless egress filtering to defend against source IP address spoofing, the DNS reflection attack could not be carried out.
c. In a “SYN Flood” attack, each TCP SYN packet that a victim receives causes it to set up TCP connection state.
d. A “DNS Reflection” attack requires the attacking client to “spoof” the source IP address of the packet containing the DNS request.
",,"b,c,d","b,c,d",,"Options b, c, and d are correct about denial of service attacks and defenses:b) If every network performed egress filtering to prevent spoofed source IP addresses from leaving their network, attackers would not be able to spoof the victim's IP as the source of DNS requests in a reflection attack.  c) In a SYN flood, each received SYN causes the server to allocate resources for a half-open TCP connection, which can exhaust the server if done at scale.d) DNS reflection attacks rely on the attacker spoofing the victim's IP as the source of DNS requests, so the DNS server's responses are reflected to the victim.Option a is incorrect because ingress filtering would not prevent the spoofed DNS requests from reaching open DNS resolvers in a reflection attack.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Reflected_attack']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
