32,What are some of the reasons that it is difficult to deploy improvements to BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. Changes are necessarily incremental because of the large installed base of routers that already run BGP.
b. BGP is implemented in hardware, so deploying changes to BGP requires changes on the timescale of hardware development cycles.
c. Deplyoing changes to BGP requires coordination across potentially tens of thousands of ASes in the Internet.
d. Only a few vendors implement BGP, and deploying changes requires convincing those vendors to change the protocol.
e. Deploying changes requires coordination in standards bodies such as the IETF.
",,"a,c,e","a,c,e",,"Deploying improvements to BGP is difficult for several reasons. First, changes must be incremental due to the large installed base of routers already running BGP (a). Any significant changes would require updating a huge number of devices. Second, deploying changes requires coordination across the many autonomous systems (ASes) that make up the Internet (c), as they all need to agree on and implement protocol updates. Finally, changes must go through standardization processes in bodies like the IETF (e) to ensure interoperability. While BGP is implemented by a limited number of vendors, it is not primarily a hardware implementation (b is incorrect). And there are actually many vendors that support BGP, not just a few (d is incorrect).","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition, by Kurose and Ross, Section 4.3', 'RFC 4271 - A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/press/internet-protocol-journal/back-issues/table-contents-53/143-bgp.html']",1,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.95,1

b. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, there is no need for ASes to use BGP to exchange routes.
c. In an RCP deployment, routers no longer have to compute routes.
d. The RCP controller operates just like a route reflector would, selecting a single best route for each destination for all client routers.
e. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, a single AS can benefit from deploying RCP even if no other ASes deploy RCP.

34,"Which of the following are true about network management with BGP, in the absence of RCP? Select all that apply.","a. BGP's interaction with the underlying routing IGP routing protocol can result in persistent forwarding loops.
b. Implementing network-wide policy sometimes causes the routers themeselves to have to carry state.
c. Each router operates and makes decisions based only on a local view of network state.

e. It is not possible to perform traffic engineering with conventional BGP.
",,"a,b,c","b,c",,"In the absence of RCP, network management with BGP has the following characteristics:b) Implementing network-wide policy sometimes requires the routers themselves to maintain state in order to enforce the policy across the network.  c) With BGP, each router operates based on its own local view of the network state, without a centralized global view. Routers exchange routing information but ultimately make independent forwarding decisions.The other options are incorrect:a) While suboptimal routing can occur due to interaction between BGP and IGP, persistent forwarding loops are prevented by BGP's loop prevention mechanisms.d) BGP is distributed across routers, so there is no single point of failure. e) Traffic engineering is possible with BGP by using techniques like AS path prepending and communities to influence path selection.","['https://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2756480&seqNum=3', 'https://www.networkcomputing.com/networking/bgp-routing-basics', 'https://www.thousandeyes.com/learning/techtorials/bgp-traffic-engineering']",0,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.9,1

b. The second phase of RCP deployment offers potential benefits such as reduced routing table size.
c. In the second phase of deployment, the RCP controller sees all routes for every destination that neighboring ASes advertise.
d. The second phase of deployment requires fewer BGP sessions at the RCP controller than the first phase, thus improving scalability of the controller.
e. In the second phase of RCP deployment, ASes do not need to use BGP to exchange routes with one another.
",,"b,c","b,c,d,e",,"In the second phase of RCP deployment, the RCP controller has full visibility of all routes advertised by neighboring ASes for every destination (c). This allows the RCP to select routes on behalf of its ASes, reducing the number of routes each router must learn and store, thus reducing routing table size (b). The RCP maintains BGP sessions with neighboring ASes, but individual routers within the AS no longer need to exchange routes directly with each other using iBGP (e). Having the RCP handle external BGP peering reduces the number of sessions compared to the first phase where each router still did external peering (d).
