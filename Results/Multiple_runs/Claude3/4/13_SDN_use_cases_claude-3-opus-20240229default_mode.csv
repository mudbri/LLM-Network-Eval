95,What are some benefits to using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Host configuration is simpler, since all hosts are visible from a single large Ethernet topology.
b. Forwarding on physical MAC addresses is simpler, since both the data center network topology and hosts' physical MAC addresses are hierarchical.
c. IP routing does not need to be reconfigured when physical or virtual machines move from one part of the network to another.
d. Scaling problems are simpler, since all hosts are configured on a single, flat topology.
e. Load balancing is easier on a layer-2 topology than on a layer 3 topology.
",,"a,c","a,c",,"Using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center provides benefits in terms of simpler host configuration, since all hosts are visible from a single large Ethernet topology. This means IP addresses can remain the same when hosts move within the data center. IP routing also does not need to be reconfigured when physical or virtual machines move from one part of the network to another, as the MAC addresses remain the same. The other options are not correct benefits of using layer-2 for a data center topology.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-7000-series-switches/white_paper_c11-574984.html', 'https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/concept/layer-2-understanding.html']",1,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,1
96,"In PortLand, what are the reasons for assigning hosts pseudo-MAC addresses, as opposed to simply forwarding traffic on physical MAC addresses? Select all that apply.","a. Hosts in the data-center network topology are more vulnerable to attack if they expose their actual physical MAC addresses, rather than having a layer of indirection.
b. It is very difficult to load balance traffic using physical MAC addresses; pseudo MAC addresses make it possible to assign traffic to destination IP addresses.
c. Without pseudo-MAC addresses, switches would have to update forwarding state whenever hosts with a particular MAC address moved from one portion of the topology to another.
d. Forwarding loops are be more common in a flat layer-2 topology than they are in a topology with hierarchical pseudo MAC addresses.
e. In a flat layer-2 topology, switches cannot know on which port to forward traffic without maintaining switch tables for each MAC address, since MAC addresses are flat, not hierarchical.
",,"c,e","c,e",,"Pseudo-MAC addresses are used in PortLand for two main reasons:1) Without pseudo-MAC addresses that encode location information, switches would need to update forwarding tables whenever a host moves in the network topology, since the switch port associated with that host's MAC address would change. Pseudo-MAC addresses avoid this issue by encoding switch and port information hierarchically.2) In a flat layer-2 topology using physical MAC addresses, switches cannot determine the appropriate output port for a destination MAC address just by looking at the address, since MAC addresses are flat. Forwarding tables must be maintained for every single MAC address. Pseudo-MAC addresses solve this by encoding the switch and port hierarchically in the MAC address itself.","['R.

97,What are the steps involved in the Proxy ARP process that PortLand's Fabric Manager runs?,"a. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns returns PMAC directly to the end host.
b. Edge switch sends ARP query to fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch updates its local PMAC mapping table.
c. Host sends ARP query, fabric manager intercepts ARP query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to end host.
d. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to the host.
e. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch returns PMAC to end host.
",,e,e,,"In the PortLand architecture, the Proxy ARP process involves the following steps: The host sends an ARP query to resolve the IP address. The edge switch intercepts this query and redirects it to the fabric manager. The fabric manager consults its PMAC mapping table to find the corresponding PMAC address. It then returns this PMAC address to the edge switch. Finally, the edge switch returns the PMAC address to the originating host.","[""R. Niranjan Mysore, et al.

98,"What are some of the disadvantages of today's interdomain routing protocol, BGP? Select all that apply.","a. ISPs cannot load-balance traffic across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix.
b. Routing and forwarding decisions are only based on IP prefix, not on a broader range of traffic flow attributes.
c. ISPs can only influence route selection through indirect mechanisms (e.g., prepending), rather than directly manipulating the forwarding table entries in switches.
d. ISPs cannot express preference of one route over another, given multiple routes to a destination.
e. ISPs can only influence the routing decisions of their immediate neighbor, not the entire end-to-end path.
