46,What transport layer protocol does DNS normally use?,"a. TCP
b. IP
c. UDP
d. ICMP
",,c,c,,"DNS normally uses UDP as its transport layer protocol. UDP is a lightweight, connectionless protocol that is well-suited for the small query and response messages typically exchanged in DNS interactions. UDP allows for faster transmission compared to TCP, as it does not require the overhead of establishing and maintaining a connection. However, in some cases, such as when the DNS response exceeds the maximum UDP packet size (512 bytes), DNS may fall back to using TCP for transport.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross', 'RFC 1035 - Domain Names - Implementation and Specification, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035']",1,google_4_networking_serices,0.95,1
