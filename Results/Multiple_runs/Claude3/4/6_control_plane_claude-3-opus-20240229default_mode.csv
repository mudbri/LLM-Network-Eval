43,Which of the following statements are true about the OpenFlow specification? Select all that apply.,"a. If a switch does not contain a flow table entry that matches a particular packet, the switch forwards the packet to the controller for handling.
b. The main purpose of the OpenFlow control channel is to update flow table entries on switches.
c. The OpenFlow specification provides mechanisms to perform Layer 2 learning across a network of switches.
d. Once a switch has sent one packet for a flow, it must also send all subsequent packets for that flow to the controller.
e. Some versions of the OpenFlow specification allow for performing more than one action on a single packet.
",,"a,b,e","a,b,e",,"The correct statements about the OpenFlow specification are: a) If a switch does not have a matching flow table entry for a packet, it sends the packet to the controller to determine how to handle it. b) The OpenFlow control channel is used by the controller to add, update, and delete flow entries in the switches' flow tables.  e) Later versions of OpenFlow (1.1+) allow multiple actions to be applied to a single packet. Statement c is incorrect because the OpenFlow spec itself does not provide L2 learning mechanisms - that would be implemented by the controller. Statement d is false; subsequent packets matching an existing flow entry are handled by the switch without involving the controller.","['https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/openflow-switch-v1.5.1.pdf', 'https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/openflow-spec-v1.0.0.pdf', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/openflow-protocol']",1,6_control_plane,0.95,1
44,Which of the following statements are true about dpctl? Select all that apply.,"a. dpctl is invoked from within the Mininet emulator.
b. dpctl can modify flow table entries on an OpenFlow switch.
c. dpctl can respond to network events, such as packets sent from a switch.
d. dpctl is an OpenFlow controller.
e. dpctl can inspect flow table entries on an OpenFlow switch.
",,"b,e","b,e",,"dpctl is a command line utility that allows interaction with OpenFlow switches. It can be used to inspect and modify flow table entries on an OpenFlow switch. However, dpctl is not invoked from within Mininet, does not respond to network events like an OpenFlow controller would, and is not itself an OpenFlow controller.","['https://github.com/CPqD/ofsoftswitch13/wiki/Dpctl-Documentation', 'https://www.openvswitch.org/support/dist-docs/ovs-ofctl.8.txt']",1,6_control_plane,0.9,1
45,Which of the following are reasonable considerations for the choice of controller? Select all that apply.,"a. Performance of the programming language that the controller is implemented in.
b. Support for and integration with cloud applications.
c. Ease of learning curve.
d. Need for production-quality operation.
e. Speed of prototyping.
",,"a,b,c,d,e","a,b,d",,"When choosing an SDN controller, several factors should be considered. The performance of the programming language the controller is implemented in (a) is important for handling a large number of network events. Support for and integration with cloud applications (b) is valuable as many networks now span on-premises and cloud environments. The need for production-quality operation (d) is critical for enterprise deployments that require stability and reliability. While ease of learning curve (c) and speed of prototyping (e) are nice to have, they are less critical considerations compared to performance, cloud integration, and production-readiness when selecting a controller for real-world use.","['Software Defined Networks: A Comprehensive Approach, Second Edition by Paul Goransson, Chuck Black', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/sdn-controllers/', 'https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-definition/']",0,6_control_plane,0.9,1

b. Pox
c. CpQD
d. Floodlight
e. Ryu

47,Which of the following are true about Pox? Select all that apply.,"a. Pox automatically determines the order to install flow table rules, to avoid inconsistent forwarding behavior.
b. Pox's _handle_PacketIn function determines how a packet should be handled when it arrives at the controller.
c. Pox provides a function to modify flow table entries at a switch.
d. Pox's performance is typically slower than NOX.
e. Pox automatically determines the priority between two conflicting rules.
",,"b,c,d","b,c,d",,Pox's _handle_PacketIn function is called when a packet arrives at the controller and determines how it should be handled (b). Pox provides functions to modify flow table entries at switches (c). Pox is implemented in Python which typically has slower performance compared to NOX which uses C++ (d). Pox does not automatically determine flow rule order or priority - this needs to be explicitly specified by the controller application to avoid inconsistencies (a and e are incorrect).,"['https://noxrepo.github.io/pox-doc/html/', 'https://github.com/noxrepo/pox', 'https://openflow.stanford.edu/display/ONL/POX+Wiki']",1,6_control_plane,0.9,1
48,What is the difference between a hard timeout and an idle timeout?,"a. A hard timeout occurs exactly at the specified interval, whereas an idle timeout may occur slightly later than the specified interval.
b. A hard timeout expunges a flow table entry regardless of whether there have been active matches, whereas an idle timeout expunges the flow table entry only if there have been no matches for that flow within the specified interval.
c. A hard timeout expunges all flow table entry from the switch, whereas an idle timeout only expunges one flow at a time.
d. A hard timeout expunges a flow table entry for all switches in the network, whereas an idle timeout only expunges the flow table entry on the switches that have seen no matches for that flow within the specified interval.
",,b,b,,"The key difference between a hard timeout and an idle timeout is how they determine when to remove a flow table entry. A hard timeout will remove the entry after the specified time interval regardless of whether there have been any matches for that flow. In contrast, an idle timeout only removes the entry if there have been no matches for that particular flow within the specified time period. So the hard timeout is based purely on elapsed time, while the idle timeout also considers the activity or inactivity of the specific flow.","['OpenFlow Switch Specification Version 1.5.1, Open Networking Foundation, https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/openflow-switch-v1.5.1.pdf', 'Flowgrammable, SDN/OpenFlow Tutorial, https://flowgrammable.org/sdn/openflow/message-layer/flowmod/']",1,6_control_plane,0.95,1
49,Which of the following are true about hubs and learning switches? Select all that apply,"a. A hub implemented in Pox requires all incoming packets to be directed to the controller.
b. A learning switch requires more logic at the controller (in terms of lines of code in Pox) than a hub.
c. A learning switch implemented in Pox can be easily extended to support firewall capabilities.
d. A learning switch implemented in Pox requires all incoming packets to be redirected to the controller.
e. A hub forwards an incoming packet on all ports (except the incoming port), whereas a switch only floods an incoming packet on all ports if it does not have a table entry that determines the output port for that packet.
",,"b,c,e","c,e",,"A learning switch can be extended to support firewall capabilities by adding logic at the controller to filter packets based on predefined rules (c). A hub floods incoming packets on all ports except the incoming port, while a learning switch only floods if it doesn't have a matching entry in its forwarding table to determine the output port (e). A hub does not require all packets to be sent to the controller (a), and a learning switch requires more controller logic than a hub (b).

b. _handle_PacketIn
c. AddRule
d. init
e. launch
",,a,"a,b",,"The 'connection.addListeners' function registers the controller to listen for specific OpenFlow events, including PacketIn messages. The '_handle_PacketIn' function is the event handler that processes the PacketIn messages when they are received by the controller.

b. action
c. redirect
d. drop
e. forward
",,"a,b","a,b",,"The two key steps of an OpenFlow flow table entry are match and action. The match step determines if an incoming packet matches the criteria specified in the flow entry.

b. It only supports OpenFlow as a ""southbound"" control framework.
c. Its code shares a lot of similarities with Beacon.
d. Open Daylight only supports proprietary switches from Cisco and IBM.
e. It is slower and less scalable than some of the more lightweight SDN controllers such as Pox.
