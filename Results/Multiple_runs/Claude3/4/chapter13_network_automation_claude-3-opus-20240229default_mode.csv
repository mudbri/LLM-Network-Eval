218,Which of the following configuration management tools uses agentless architecture for managing network devices?,"a. Ansible
b. Puppet
c. Chef
d. Ansible and Puppet
e. Puppet and Chef
",,a,a,,Ansible uses an agentless architecture for managing network devices. It connects to devices over SSH or API and does not require any agent software to be installed on the managed devices. Puppet and Chef both use an agent-based architecture where an agent needs to be installed on each managed device to communicate with the central server.,"['Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Documentation: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.2/html/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_installation_guide/architecture-overview', 'Puppet Documentation: https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/architecture.html', 'Chef Documentation: https://docs.chef.io/architecture/']",1,chapter13_network_automation,0.95,1

221,A Layer 2 switch examines a frame’s destination MAC address and forwards that frame out of the port G0/2. That action occurs as part of which plane of the switch?,"a. Data plane
b. Management plane
c. Control Plane
d. None of the above
",,a,a,,"The data plane on a Layer 2 switch is responsible for forwarding frames based on the destination MAC address. When a switch receives a frame, it examines the destination MAC address and looks up the corresponding port in its MAC address table. It then forwards the frame out of that port, which in this case is G0/2. This process of frame forwarding based on MAC addresses occurs in the data plane of the switch.","['Cisco Networking Academy: Introduction to Networks v7.0 - Chapter 5: Ethernet', 'Cisco Press: CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1 - Chapter 5: Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs']",1,chapter13_network_automation,0.95,1

228,"Your company decides to move away from manual configuration methods, making changes by editing centralized configuration files. The issues you are facing with non-centralized configuration files are:

VCS allows multiple people to collaborate on the same set of files while maintaining a history of revisions. This solves the issues mentioned in the question, as it provides visibility into who made configuration changes and tracks the evolution of the files over time. VCS is commonly used for managing source code, but it can also be applied to configuration files to maintain a centralized and auditable record of changes.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control', 'https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control', 'https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-version-control']",1,chapter13_network_automation,0.95,1
