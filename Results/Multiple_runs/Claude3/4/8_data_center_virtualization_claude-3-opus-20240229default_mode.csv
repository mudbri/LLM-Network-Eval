62,Which of the following are true of “network slicing”? Select all that apply.,"a. Network operators can use slicing to test configurations on “shadow” networks that mirror a production network topology.
b. One way to slice networks is according to “flow space”, whereby different controllers might control distinct and non-overlapping traffic flows.
c. A controller can prevent one network slice from interfering with the resources of another.
d. Multi-tenant datacenters are one use case for network slicing.
e. Conventional (i.e., non-SDN) networks have no concept of network virtualization or slicing.
",,"a,b,d","a,b,c,d",,"Network slicing allows creating multiple logical networks over a shared physical infrastructure. This enables (a) testing configurations on isolated 'shadow' networks mirroring production, (b) slicing by dedicating different controllers to distinct traffic flows, (c) isolating resources between slices to prevent interference, and (d) supporting multi-tenancy in data centers. However, (e) is incorrect as conventional networks do have virtualization concepts like VLANs, although SDN enables more flexible and dynamic slicing.","['https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/nfv/definitions/what-is-network-slicing/', 'https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-definition/', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/network-slicing.html']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.95,1
63,Which of the following are true about flow spaces? Select all that apply.,"a. Two flow spaces cannot overlap.
b. One host could send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces.
c. Flow spaces can only be defined according to combinations of packet header fields.
d. Flowspace isolation separates individual virtual networks from one another but incurs some performance penalty for doing so.
e. Two controllers that write data-plane rules for non-overlapping parts of flowspace can never cause traffic from one “slice” to enter the other slice.
",,b,"b,d",,"Two flow spaces can overlap, meaning one host could send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces (b). Flow spaces are not limited to just packet header field combinations - they can be defined based on switch ports, VLAN tags, etc. (c is incorrect). Flowspace isolation does separate virtual networks but comes with a performance cost (d). Even with non-overlapping flow spaces, improper controller programming could still allow traffic to cross between slices (e is incorrect).","['https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/openflow-spec-v1.3.0.pdf', 'https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/openflow-switch-v1.5.0.pdf', 'https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos597E/papers/sdnintro.pdf']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,1
64,Which of the following describe the control-plane checks that FlowVisor implements? Select all that apply.,"a. When a packet must be forwarded to a controller, Flowvisor forwards traffic to the correct controller based on which controller “owns” the flowspace corresponding to that packet.
b. Flowvisor prevents each slice's controller from being the target of a denial of service attack from other slices.
c. Flowvisor can only instantiate network slices based on the network topology, not based on other properties, such as application traffic.
d. Flowvisor prevents a controller from writing data-plane rules to a part of flowspace that it does not own.
e. Flowvisor installs traffic shaping and quality of service rules to ensure that each network slice has guaranteed resources.
",,"a,d","a,d",,"FlowVisor implements control-plane checks to ensure each controller only operates within its assigned flowspace. It forwards packets to the correct controller based on flowspace ownership (a) and prevents controllers from writing data-plane rules to flowspace they don't own (d).

65,Which of the following are applications in a home network that network slicing could enable? Select all that apply.,"a. Quality of service for certain applications (e.g., video streaming)
b. Traceback of attack traffic to its source
c. Smart grid applications
d. Load balance of inbound traffic
e. Guest WiFi access
",,"a,c,e","a,c,e",,Network slicing in a home network could enable: a) Quality of service for certain applications like video streaming by allocating dedicated bandwidth.  c) Smart grid applications by providing a separate secure slice for energy management devices. e) Guest WiFi access by creating an isolated slice for visitors.

d. Google running Gmail and search from a common facility
e. Two enterprises hosting data in a shared facility.

c. Network virtualization requires SDN
d. SDN makes some aspects of network virtualization easier to manage
e. Network virtualization enables SDN
",,"a,d","a,d",,"SDN controllers can help manage various aspects of the network beyond just configuration, including storage and data facilities (a). Additionally, while network virtualization does not require SDN, SDN can make certain aspects of network virtualization easier to implement and manage (d).
