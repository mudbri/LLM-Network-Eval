b. MAC address
c. ARP address
d. Routing table
e. Destination IP address
f. ARP table
",,"a,b","a,b",,"In a spoofing attack, the attacker typically falsifies or 'spoofs' the source IP address and/or the MAC address. By spoofing the source IP, the attacker can hide their true identity and location. Spoofing the MAC address allows the attacker to impersonate another device on the local network. The other choices - ARP address, routing table, destination IP, and ARP table - are not commonly spoofed in these types of attacks.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Wendell Odom, Chapter 6: Fundamentals of IP Security', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/what-is-spoofing.html']",1,chapter8_security_fundamentals,0.95,1
