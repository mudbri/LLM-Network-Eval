d. 8.8.8.8
",,"c,d","c,d",,The correct answers are c (192.168.1.1) and d (8.8.8.8). These are valid IPv4 addresses because each octet (group of numbers separated by periods) is within the valid range of 0 to 255. Option a (257.70.312.49) is invalid because the first octet exceeds 255. Option b (123.456.123.456) is also invalid because the second and third octets exceed 255.,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address', 'https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry/iana-ipv4-special-registry.xhtml']",1,google_2_networking_layer,1,1

",,d,d,,CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing. It is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing Internet Protocol packets.

b. 3
c. 4
d. 2
",,c,c,,"A subnet mask has 4 octets, just like an IPv4 address. Each octet is 8 bits and represents a portion of the 32-bit address used to designate the network and host portions of the address.
