90,The protocol used to communicate network errors is known as __________.,"a. ICMP
b. Traceroute
c. TCP
d. UDP
",,a,a,,"ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is used to communicate network errors and operational information between network devices. It is not used for end-to-end data transfer like TCP or UDP, but rather for sending control messages such as error notifications when network issues occur.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross', 'RFC 792 - Internet Control Message Protocol, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc792']",1,google_6_troubleshooting_and_future_networking,0.95,1
91,The ping utility sends what message type?,"a. Echo Request
b. Echo Reply
c. Destination Network Unknown
d. Destination Network Unreachable
",,a,a,,"The ping utility sends ICMP Echo Request messages to the target host and expects ICMP Echo Reply messages in return. If the target host is reachable and functioning properly, it will respond with Echo Reply messages. This allows ping to determine the round-trip time and packet loss, thereby testing the reachability of the target host and the network path.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1, Chapter 16: IP Services, Cisco Press', 'RFC 792 - Internet Control Message Protocol, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc792']",1,google_6_troubleshooting_and_future_networking,0.95,1

b. Division
c. Subtraction
d. Addition
",,c,c,,"During a traceroute, each router that receives the packet subtracts one from the Time To Live (TTL) value before forwarding the packet to the next hop. If the TTL reaches zero, the router discards the packet and sends an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the source. This allows traceroute to map the route and measure transit delays of packets across an IP network.","['Kurose, J. F., & Ross, K. W. (2017). Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach (7th Edition).
