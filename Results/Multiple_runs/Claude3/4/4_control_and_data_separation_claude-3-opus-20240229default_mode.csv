b. Determining that a user's MAC address is authentic before allowing it to send traffic on the network.
c. Load balancing traffic across two output ports based on the hash of each packet's source IP address.
d. Determining the forwarding path that satisfies an access control policy.
e. Computing a shortest path routing tree.
",,"b,d,e","d,e",,"Control plane operations involve making decisions about how to handle network traffic. From the given choices, determining the forwarding path that satisfies an access control policy (d) and computing a shortest path routing tree (e) are control plane functions. They involve making high-level decisions about traffic forwarding based on policies and routing algorithms.

25,What could be the operational steps behind the AT&T's IRSCP (a commercial version of the Routing Control Platform) for detecting malicious traffic? Select all that apply.,"a. The controller sees all traffic passing through the network, detects an attack, and installs a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where the attack traffic is originating.
b. The end host changes its IP address so that it is no longer the target of the attack traffic.
c. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to re-route traffic through a deep-packet inspection device.
d. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to install a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where attack traffic is originating.
e. A victim end host sends an alert to an on-path firewall about the source and nature of an attack, at which point the firewall installs a null route to drop the traffic at the entry point where the attack is originating.
",,"c,d","c,d",,"The correct steps for AT&T's IRSCP in detecting and mitigating malicious traffic are:c) A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to re-route traffic through a deep-packet inspection device.

This prevents the malicious traffic from propagating further into the network.The other options are incorrect because:a) The controller does not see all traffic and directly install null routes. b) The end host changing its IP does not resolve the attack at a network level.e) The end host does not directly interact with and instruct an on-path firewall.","['https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos597E/papers/xie.pdf', 'https://www.networkworld.com/article/2297171/at-t-s-sdn-plans-include-new-approach-to-operations.html']",1,4_control_and_data_separation,0.9,1
26,What are some example network management applications that become easier with control and data plane separation? Select all that apply.,"a. Improved interdomain routing security.
b. Customer-controlled egress selection.
c. Improved logging capabilities.
d. Planned maintenance of an edge router.
e. Forecasting of network capacity.
",,"a,b,d","b,d",,"With the separation of control and data planes in SDN, certain network management tasks become easier. Customer-controlled egress selection (b) is simplified because the control plane has a global network view and can optimize egress point selection based on customer policies. Planned maintenance of an edge router (d) is also easier since the control plane can proactively reroute traffic away from the router to be serviced, minimizing disruption. While SDN may provide some benefits for the other options listed, they are not as directly impacted by control and data plane separation specifically.","['Software Defined Networks: A Comprehensive Approach by Paul Goransson and Chuck Black', 'SDN: Software Defined Networks by Thomas D.

27,What are some of the motivations for using Layer-2 forwarding in a data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Ability to use existing routing protocols to establish paths between hosts.
b. Easier configuration/administration, since there is no need to number hosts or configure subnets.
c. Better security properties.
d. Better scaling properties.
e. Better load balancing properties.
",,b,"b,d",,"The main motivations for using Layer-2 forwarding in a data center are:b) Easier configuration and administration, since there is no need to assign IP addresses to hosts or configure IP subnets. With Layer-2 forwarding, hosts can be plugged in and automatically start communicating without additional IP configuration.d) Better scaling properties. Layer-2 forwarding allows the creation of very large Layer-2 domains that can span an entire data center. This avoids the need to segment the network into smaller IP subnets, which can be administratively complex as the data center grows.The other options are not strong motivations:a) Layer-2 forwarding does not use routing protocols. c) Layer-2 forwarding does not inherently provide better security than Layer-3 IP forwarding.e) Load balancing is typically done at higher layers and is independent of Layer-2 vs Layer-3 forwarding.","['https://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2928193&seqNum=2', 'https://www.networkcomputing.com/data-centers/layer-2-vs-layer-3-data-center-designs']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.9,1
28,How does the separation of the control and data plane make networking in data centers easier?,"a. Virtual machines can be migrated within the network without renumbering entire portions of the network or re-assigning network services to different IP addresses.
b. The control plane allows traffic to be forwarded using Layer 2 addresses, thus allowing automatic load balance across the topology.
c. The separation allows fewer switches to be used in the data center topology, thus lowering costs.
d. All routes can be controlled and monitored from a central point of control.
e. A network controller can permit the renumbering of end hosts to have topology-dependent Layer 2 MAC addresses.
",,"a,d,e","a,d",,"The separation of control and data planes in software-defined networking (SDN) allows for easier management of data center networks in two key ways:  a) Virtual machines can be migrated within the network without the need to renumber IP addresses or reassign network services, because the SDN controller maintains a logical view of the network separate from the underlying physical infrastructure. This enables greater flexibility in workload placement and mobility.  d) Having a logically centralized control plane allows all routes and network policies to be managed and monitored from a single point of control, rather than having to configure each network device individually. This simplifies network operations and troubleshooting.  The other options are incorrect: b) The data plane still forwards traffic based on IP addresses at Layer 3, not Layer 2 MAC addresses.  c) SDN does not necessarily reduce the number of physical switches needed. e) Hosts still retain their original MAC addresses which are independent of network topology.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-definition/', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/data-center-virtualization/what-is-sdn.html', 'Kreutz, D., Ramos, F., Verissimo, P., Rothenberg, C.

32,"Which property guarantees that each RCP replica continues to install correct forwarding state in the network data plane, even in the case of a partition in the data plane?","a. Each controller has a complete view of the portion of the network that it is controlling, and therefore can guarantee consistent routing within that partition.
b. The controller cannot see many of the routers in the network anyway, so there is no way for it to install incorrect routing state in the routers that it is not connected to.
c. The controllers are partitioned from the network routers, and the routers will fall back to running a distributed routing protocol.
d. Running the network from a single high-level control plane guarantees that network partitions and loops never occur in the first place.
