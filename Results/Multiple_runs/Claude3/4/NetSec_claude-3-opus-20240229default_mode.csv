b. MAC address security
c. DHCP snooping
d. DHCP authentication""
",,c,c,,"DHCP snooping is a Cisco switch feature that can help mitigate DHCP attacks. It works by filtering DHCP messages based on trusted and untrusted ports. Untrusted ports are typically access ports connected to end-user devices, while trusted ports are those connected to legitimate DHCP servers. DHCP snooping builds a binding table to track valid DHCP leases and drops DHCP messages from untrusted sources that don't match the table entries. This prevents rogue DHCP servers from distributing false IP configurations and conducting DHCP starvation or spoofing attacks.","['Cisco Networking Academy: CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 2', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12-2SX/configuration/guide/book/snoodhcp.html']",1,NetSec,0.95,1
