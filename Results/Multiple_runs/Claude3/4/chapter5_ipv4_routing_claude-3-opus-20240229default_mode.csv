92,"A LAN design uses a Layer 3 EtherChannel between two switches SW1 and SW2, with port-channel interface 1 used on both switches. SW1 uses ports G0/1 and G0/2 in the channel. However, only interface G0/1 is bundled into the channel and working. Think about the configuration settings on port G0/2 that could have existed before adding G0/2 to the EtherChannel. Which answers identify a setting that could prevent IOS from adding G0/2 to the Layer 3 EtherChannel? (Choose two answers.)","a. A different STP cost (spanning-tree cost value)
b. A different access VLAN (switchport access vlan vlanid)
c. A different speed (speed value)
d. A default setting for switchport (switchport)
",,"c,d","b,d",,"A different access VLAN (b) and the default setting for switchport (d) could prevent IOS from adding port G0/2 to the Layer 3 EtherChannel. For a Layer 3 EtherChannel, the physical interfaces should not be configured as switchports (Layer 2 ports). If G0/2 is configured with a different access VLAN or as a switchport, it will not be compatible with the Layer 3 EtherChannel configuration and will not be bundled.

b. VTP on the switch removing VLAN 5 from the switch’s VLAN list
c. 1 out of 10 working VLAN 4 access ports failing due to physical problems
d. A shutdown command issued from VLAN 6 configuration mode
