54,Which of the following properties are characteristics of virtual networks (but not necessarily characteristics of SDN). Select all that apply.,"a. Separates the data and control plane.
b. Refactors network control so that network behavior is controlled from a single logically centralized controller.
c. Separates logical and physical networks.
d. Often deployed in data center networks to allow multiple tenants to share physical network infrastructure.
e. Abstracts the details of the physical network.
",,"c,d,e","c,d,e",,"Virtual networks have the following key characteristics:  c) They separate the logical network topology from the underlying physical network infrastructure. Multiple virtual networks can be overlaid on the same physical network.  d) They are commonly used in multi-tenant data center environments to allow each tenant to have their own isolated logical network while sharing the same physical network hardware. This enables better utilization of physical resources.  e) Virtual networks abstract away the details and complexity of the physical network from the logical network. The virtual network presents a simplified logical topology to the user.  While virtual networks and SDN are related concepts that are often used together, properties (a) and (b) are more specific to SDN rather than virtual networks in general. Separation of control and data planes and logically centralized control are key tenets of SDN architectures.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_network', 'https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/virtual-networking', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/switches/what-is-a-virtual-network.html']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.95,1
55,Which of the following are possible ways of creating virtual links in a virtual network? Select all that apply.,"a. A wide-area tunnel, whereby an IP packet is encapsulated in an MPLS tunnel by attaching an MPLS header to the packet.
b. Longest-prefix match forwarding on an IP router.
c. A wide-area tunnel, whereby an Ethernet packet sent between two virtual machines is encapsulated in an IP packet.
d. VLAN switching based on a VLAN tag.
e. Pairs of virtual Ethernet interfaces, where one end of the Ethernet interface pair resides in the virtual environment, and the other resides in the root namespace on the host machine.
",,"a,c,d,e","a,c,d,e",,"Virtual links in a virtual network can be created through various methods. MPLS tunneling (a) and IP encapsulation of Ethernet packets (c) enable wide-area tunnels. VLAN switching based on tags (d) and paired virtual Ethernet interfaces between the virtual environment and host (e) also allow virtual link creation. Longest-prefix match forwarding (b) is a general IP routing technique, not specific to virtual links.","['Software Defined Networks: A Comprehensive Approach by Paul Goransson, Chuck Black', 'Network Virtualization by Victor Moreno, Kumar Reddy', 'Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach by James Kurose, Keith Ross']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.95,1
56,Which of the following are true of the Mininet network emulator? Select all that apply.,"a. It requires running OpenFlow-capable switches.
b. It is difficult to use it to route traffic for real services.
c. Mininet only allows users to create three types of topologies: linear, tree, and single-switch topologies.
d. It can create an emulation that runs across multiple physically distributed nodes.
e. All of the hosts in the topology must run the same underlying operating system.
",,"b,e","b,e",,"Mininet does not require running OpenFlow-capable switches, as it can emulate OpenFlow switches in software. It is difficult to use Mininet to route traffic for real services because the emulated network runs in a single OS process by default. Mininet allows users to create custom topologies beyond just linear, tree, and single-switch. While Mininet can create an emulation that runs across multiple physically distributed nodes, this is not the default behavior. All hosts in the emulated topology must run the same underlying OS (typically a Linux distribution) since they are emulated as processes in the same OS.","['https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Introduction-to-Mininet', 'http://mininet.org/overview/', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/mininet/']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.95,1
57,"What are the benefits of emulation as opposed to, say, simulation? Select all that apply.","a. An emulation will complete faster than a simulation.
b. An emulator makes it possible to ""port"" experiments from one machine to another.
c. An emulator allows the experimenter run real software on each of the nodes in the emulation.
d. An emulation is easier to debug than a simulation.
e. Every run of the emulator will yield exactly the same results, resulting in reproducible experiments.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"The main benefits of emulation over simulation are: b) An emulator makes it possible to 'port' experiments from one machine to another. This is because an emulator replicates the hardware and software environment, allowing the same setup to be recreated on different machines.c) An emulator allows the experimenter to run real software on each of the nodes in the emulation. Unlike a simulation which models the behavior, an emulator provides an actual replica of the system where unmodified software can be run.The other options are not necessarily true. An emulation is not guaranteed to be faster, easier to debug, or yield exactly reproducible results compared to a simulation. Those attributes depend more on the specific implementation of the emulator or simulator.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator', 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-emulator-and-simulator/']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.9,1

However, Mininet is an emulation environment running on a single machine, so it cannot measure real-world latency between geographically distant hosts (a). Also, while IP addresses can be assigned, Mininet does not include a DHCP server for automatic IP assignment (c).","['Mininet Walkthrough - https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Walkthrough', 'Introduction to Mininet - https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Introduction-to-Mininet', 'Mininet FAQ - https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/FAQ']",0,7_virtual_networking,0.95,1

c. Allowing experimental protocols to coincide with a production network.
d. Central management of security policies.
e. Dynamic workload placement in multi-tenant data centers.
",,"b,d,e","b,c,d,e",,"The Nicira Network Virtualization Platform (NVP) enables several key applications in data center networks:b) It allows creating more than the 4096 virtual networks possible with VLAN tags. NVP's virtual networks are not limited by the 12-bit VLAN identifier.c) NVP supports running experimental protocols alongside production traffic by isolating them in separate virtual networks. This enables testing new protocols without impacting the production network. d) NVP provides a central control plane to manage network security policies across the entire data center fabric, rather than configuring policies on individual switches.e) For multi-tenant data centers, NVP enables agile placement and migration of tenant workloads by abstracting the physical network topology. Workloads can be dynamically placed anywhere in the data center.The one option not explicitly called out as an application of NVP is (a) easier IPv6 transition. While NVP likely simplifies some aspects of IPv6 migration, this is not a commonly stated use case in the NVP literature.","['Koponen, Teemu, et al.

61,Select the statement that is most true about the relationship between network virtualization and SDNs.,"a. Network virtualization is a potential enabler for software-defined networks, since the separation of data and control planes first requires the creation of a logical network.
b. Software-defined networking is a potential enabler for virtual networks, since separation of data and control planes makes it easier to manage a logical network topology.
c. Network virtualization is a new concept introduced by Amazon, Nicira, and industry players; it only made sense to talk about network virtualization once central SDN controllers existed.
d. Network virtualization and software-defined networking each enable the other: SDN cannot exist without network virtualization, and network virtualization cannot exist without SDN.
",,b,"a,b",,"Both statements a and b are true about the relationship between network virtualization and SDNs. Network virtualization enables the creation of logical networks separate from the underlying physical infrastructure, which is a prerequisite for separating the data and control planes in SDNs. At the same time, the separation of data and control planes in SDNs makes it easier to manage and orchestrate virtual network topologies. So network virtualization and SDN are complementary technologies that enable each other, but one is not strictly dependent on the other.","['https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/network-virtualization', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/software-defined-networking/what-is-sdn.html', 'https://www.juniper.net/us/en/products/what-is/network-virtualization.html']",0,7_virtual_networking,0.9,1
