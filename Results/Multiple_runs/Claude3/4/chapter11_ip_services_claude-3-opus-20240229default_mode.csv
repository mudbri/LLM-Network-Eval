You are responsible to find out why users are not being able to reach the Internet.","a. The cause is not related to dynamic NAT
b. The command output does not provide any clue to identify the problem
c. Dynamic NAT can't use Standard ACLs
d. The NAT pool does not have enough entries to fulfill the user's requests
",,d,d,,"The output shows that the NAT pool 'examsdigest' has a total of 10 addresses available, and all 10 have been allocated (100% utilization). Additionally, there have been 595 'misses', indicating that there were 595 attempts to allocate an address from the pool when no addresses were available. This suggests that the NAT pool is exhausted and does not have enough entries to fulfill all the users' requests, preventing some users from reaching the Internet.","['Cisco CCNA Official Cert Guide, Wendell Odom, Chapter 10: Network Address Translation', 'Cisco Documentation: Configuring Dynamic NAT - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipaddr_nat/configuration/15-mt/nat-15-mt-book/iadnat-addr-consv.html']",1,chapter11_ip_services,0.95,1

b. 3
c. 4
d. 5
",,c,c,,"In Cisco IOS, the severity level 4 corresponds to a Warning condition. Severity levels range from 0 to 7, with 0 being the most critical (Emergency) and 7 being the least critical (Debugging). A severity level of 4 indicates that a warning condition has occurred, which is not necessarily critical but should be monitored and addressed if necessary.","['Cisco IOS Configuration Fundamentals Command Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/fundamentals/command/Cisco_IOS_Configuration_Fundamentals_Command_Reference.html', 'Cisco IOS System Error Messages: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/open-shortest-path-first-ospf/200283-IOS-System-Error-Messages.html']",1,chapter11_ip_services,0.95,1

b. 6
c. 4
d. 5
",,b,b,,"Severity level 6 corresponds to informational messages in Cisco IOS. These messages are not errors, but rather provide general information about system operation or status. Severity level 1 is the highest severity and indicates a critical condition. Level 4 means a warning, while level 5 is a notification severity.

b. FALSE
",,a,a,,Message integrity is indeed one of the key features introduced in SNMPv3.

b. show cdp
c. show running-config
d. show interface brief
",,b,b,,"The 'show cdp' command is used to display information about the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) configuration and status. It will indicate whether CDP is enabled globally on the device. The other options are incorrect because: - 'show protocols' displays the status of routing protocols, not CDP - 'show running-config' displays the entire running configuration, which would include CDP status but requires parsing the full config - 'show interface brief' provides a summary of interface status and configuration, but does not include CDP information","['Cisco IOS Configuration Fundamentals Command Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/fundamentals/command/Cisco_IOS_Configuration_Fundamentals_Command_Reference.html', 'Cisco CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1, Chapter 12: CDP and LLDP']",1,chapter11_ip_services,0.95,1

Host A and host B attach to the same LAN and have correct default router settings per the FHRP configuration. Which of the following statements is true for this LAN?","a. You can't connect two routers to the same LAN subnet.
b. If one router fails, hosts can't send packets off-subnet
c. If one router fails, both hosts will use the one remaining router as a default router
d. if one router fails, only one of the two hosts will still be able to send packets off-subnet
",,c,c,,"In a LAN with two routers using a First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP) like HSRP or VRRP, if one router fails, the other router will take over as the active router. All hosts on the LAN will then use the remaining active router as their default gateway to send packets off-subnet. The FHRP ensures that there is always an active router available to forward traffic, providing redundancy and preventing a single point of failure.","['Cisco CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Chapter 16: First Hop Redundancy Protocol', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/hot-standby-router-protocol-hsrp/9234-hsrpguidetoc.html']",1,chapter11_ip_services,0.95,1

QoS can manage bandwidth (a) by allocating a minimum bandwidth guarantee to certain traffic. It can manage loss (c) through congestion avoidance mechanisms like selective dropping. QoS addresses delay (d) by prioritizing latency-sensitive traffic. Jitter (f), the variation in latency, is minimized by techniques like traffic shaping and scheduling.
