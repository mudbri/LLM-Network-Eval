1,Which of the following terms describe Ethernet addresses that can send one frame and is delivered to multiple devices on the LAN? (Choose two answers.),"a. Broadcast address
b. Multicast address
c. IP address
d. MAC address
e. Unicast address
",,"a,b","a,b",,"Broadcast and multicast addresses are used in Ethernet to send a single frame that is delivered to multiple devices on a LAN.

d. Forwarding IP packets based on a packet’s destination IP address
",,"a,b","a,b",,"The main functions of a routing protocol are to learn routes from neighboring routers and advertise known routes to those neighbors. Routing protocols enable routers to dynamically share routing information, allowing them to learn about remote networks and determine the best paths to reach those networks.

b. Data and Pad
c. Start Frame Delimiter
d. Preamble
",,a,a,,"The Frame Check Sequence (FCS) field in the Ethernet frame trailer provides a method for the receiving NIC to determine if the frame experienced transmission errors. The sending device calculates a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) value based on the frame contents and appends it to the end of the frame in the FCS field. The receiving device recalculates the CRC and compares it to the FCS value. If they match, the frame is considered error-free.
