62,Which of the following are true of “network slicing”? Select all that apply.,"a. Network operators can use slicing to test configurations on “shadow” networks that mirror a production network topology.
b. One way to slice networks is according to “flow space”, whereby different controllers might control distinct and non-overlapping traffic flows.
c. A controller can prevent one network slice from interfering with the resources of another.
d. Multi-tenant datacenters are one use case for network slicing.
e. Conventional (i.e., non-SDN) networks have no concept of network virtualization or slicing.
",,"a,b,d","a,b,c,d",,"Network slicing allows creating multiple logical networks over a shared physical infrastructure. Answers a, b, c, and d are all correct about network slicing:a. Slicing can be used to create test or 'shadow' networks that mirror production for testing configurations. b. Flow space is one way to slice networks, where different controllers handle distinct, non-overlapping traffic flows.c. Controllers can enforce isolation between slices to prevent interference.d. Multi-tenant datacenters are a key use case, allowing tenants to get isolated virtual networks.However, e is incorrect, as conventional networks do have concepts of virtualization and slicing, such as VLANs, VPNs, and virtual routers. SDN enables more flexible and dynamic slicing though.","['https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/nfv/definitions/what-is-network-slicing/', 'https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-definition/', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128618308739']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.95,1
63,Which of the following are true about flow spaces? Select all that apply.,"a. Two flow spaces cannot overlap.
b. One host could send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces.
c. Flow spaces can only be defined according to combinations of packet header fields.
d. Flowspace isolation separates individual virtual networks from one another but incurs some performance penalty for doing so.
e. Two controllers that write data-plane rules for non-overlapping parts of flowspace can never cause traffic from one “slice” to enter the other slice.
",,b,"b,d",,"Two statements are true about flow spaces:b) One host could send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces. This can happen if the traffic matches the definitions of multiple flow spaces.  d) Flowspace isolation does separate individual virtual networks but at the cost of some performance overhead to enforce the isolation.Statement a is false because flow spaces can overlap. Statement c is false because flow spaces can be defined by other attributes beyond just packet header fields, such as physical ports. Statement e is false because even with non-overlapping flow spaces, misconfiguration or bugs could cause traffic to cross from one slice to another.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/openflow-spec-v1.3.0.pdf', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/flow-space']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,1
64,Which of the following describe the control-plane checks that FlowVisor implements? Select all that apply.,"a. When a packet must be forwarded to a controller, Flowvisor forwards traffic to the correct controller based on which controller “owns” the flowspace corresponding to that packet.
b. Flowvisor prevents each slice's controller from being the target of a denial of service attack from other slices.
c. Flowvisor can only instantiate network slices based on the network topology, not based on other properties, such as application traffic.
d. Flowvisor prevents a controller from writing data-plane rules to a part of flowspace that it does not own.
e. Flowvisor installs traffic shaping and quality of service rules to ensure that each network slice has guaranteed resources.

b. Traceback of attack traffic to its source
c. Smart grid applications
d. Load balance of inbound traffic
e. Guest WiFi access
",,"a,c,e","a,c,e",,Network slicing in a home network could enable:a) Quality of service for certain applications like video streaming by dedicating specific network resources to ensure a good user experience.  c) Smart grid applications by providing a separate slice optimized for the security and reliability needs of connected energy devices and systems.e) Guest WiFi access by creating an isolated network slice for visitors that doesn't impact the main home network.Network slicing would not directly enable attack traceback (b) or inbound load balancing (d) in a typical home network scenario.,"['https://www.ericsson.com/en/blog/2021/6/network-slicing-for-home-networks', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9500694', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/network-slicing-coming-home-broadband/2021/06/']",1,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,1
