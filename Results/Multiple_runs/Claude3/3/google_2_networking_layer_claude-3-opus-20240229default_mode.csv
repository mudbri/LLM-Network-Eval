",,d,d,,CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing. It is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing Internet Protocol packets.

d. 2
",,c,c,,"A subnet mask, like an IP address, consists of 32 bits divided into four 8-bit 'octets'. Each octet represents a decimal number between 0 and 255, separated by a dot.

b. Distance-Vector Protocols
c. Hypertext Transfer Protocol
d. Transmission Control Protocol
",,"a,b","a,b",,"Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) are used for routing within an autonomous system. The two main types of IGPs are:  a) Link State Routing Protocols: These protocols, such as OSPF and IS-IS, use a complete topology of the network to calculate the best path. Each router shares information about the state of its directly connected links with all other routers in the network. b) Distance-Vector Protocols: These protocols, such as RIP, use distance (hop count) and direction (vector) to calculate the best path. Each router shares its routing table with its directly connected neighbors.  Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) are not types of routing protocols. HTTP is an application layer protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents, while TCP is a transport layer protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Wendell Odom, Cisco Press, 2020', 'Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, James Kurose, Keith Ross, Pearson, 2017']",1,google_2_networking_layer,0.95,1
