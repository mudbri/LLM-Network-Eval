23,Which of the following are examples of control plane operations? Select all that apply.,"a. Rate-limiting traffic so that the overall sending rate does not exceed a certain throughput.
b. Determining that a user's MAC address is authentic before allowing it to send traffic on the network.
c. Load balancing traffic across two output ports based on the hash of each packet's source IP address.
d. Determining the forwarding path that satisfies an access control policy.
e. Computing a shortest path routing tree.
",,"b,d,e","b,d,e",,"Control plane operations involve making decisions about how to handle network traffic. Determining if a user's MAC address is authentic before allowing it to send traffic (b), determining the forwarding path that satisfies an access control policy (d), and computing a shortest path routing tree (e) are all examples of control plane functions. They involve authentication, access control, and routing decisions respectively. In contrast, rate-limiting traffic (a) and load balancing based on packet hashing (c) are data plane operations that forward traffic according to the control plane's decisions.","['https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-is-sdn-control-plane/', 'https://www.networkcomputing.com/networking/understanding-sdn-control-plane', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-9000-series-switches/white-paper-c11-729383.html']",1,4_control_and_data_separation,0.95,1
25,What could be the operational steps behind the AT&T's IRSCP (a commercial version of the Routing Control Platform) for detecting malicious traffic? Select all that apply.,"a. The controller sees all traffic passing through the network, detects an attack, and installs a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where the attack traffic is originating.
b. The end host changes its IP address so that it is no longer the target of the attack traffic.
c. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to re-route traffic through a deep-packet inspection device.
d. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to install a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where attack traffic is originating.
e. A victim end host sends an alert to an on-path firewall about the source and nature of an attack, at which point the firewall installs a null route to drop the traffic at the entry point where the attack is originating.
",,"c,d","c,d",,"The correct steps for AT&T's IRSCP in detecting and mitigating malicious traffic are:c) A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to re-route traffic through a deep-packet inspection device.

This blocks the malicious traffic at the source.The other options are incorrect because:a) The controller does not see all traffic and detect attacks directly. b) The end host changing its IP does not mitigate the attack at the source.e) The end host does not send an alert directly to an on-path firewall.","['https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos597E/papers/IRSCP.pdf', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/software-defined-networking-sdn-definition/']",1,4_control_and_data_separation,0.9,1
26,What are some example network management applications that become easier with control and data plane separation? Select all that apply.,"a. Improved interdomain routing security.
b. Customer-controlled egress selection.
c. Improved logging capabilities.
d. Planned maintenance of an edge router.
e. Forecasting of network capacity.
",,"a,b,d","b,d",,"With the separation of control and data planes in Software Defined Networking, certain network management tasks become easier. Customer-controlled egress selection (b) is simplified as the customer can directly program the control plane to select the desired egress point, without needing to configure individual routers. Planned maintenance of an edge router (d) is also easier as the control plane can pre-emptively reroute traffic away from the router to be serviced, minimizing disruption. While SDN may offer some security and logging improvements, interdomain routing security (a) and logging capabilities (c) are not necessarily made significantly easier by control/data plane separation itself. Forecasting network capacity (e) is more of a planning/analysis task rather than a direct benefit of separating the planes.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-definition/', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/software-defined-networking/overview.html', 'https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/sdn/topics/concept/sdn-overview.html']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.8,1
27,What are some of the motivations for using Layer-2 forwarding in a data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Ability to use existing routing protocols to establish paths between hosts.
b. Easier configuration/administration, since there is no need to number hosts or configure subnets.
c. Better security properties.
d. Better scaling properties.
e. Better load balancing properties.
",,b,"b,d",,"The main motivations for using Layer-2 forwarding in a data center are:b) Easier configuration and administration, since there is no need to number hosts or configure subnets. With Layer-2 forwarding, hosts can be assigned arbitrary MAC addresses and moved around the network without needing to reconfigure IP addresses and subnets each time.d) Better scaling properties. Layer-2 networks can scale to larger sizes compared to Layer-3 networks. Routing tables do not need to be maintained for each individual host. Instead, the network scales by adding more switches and links.The other options are not strong motivations:a) Layer-2 forwarding uses MAC address learning and spanning tree rather than IP routing protocols. c) Security is orthogonal to the choice of Layer-2 vs Layer-3.e) Load balancing depends more on the overall network design and is not inherently better with Layer-2.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center_network_architecture', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-5000-series-switches/white_paper_c11-690079.html']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.9,1
28,How does the separation of the control and data plane make networking in data centers easier?,"a. Virtual machines can be migrated within the network without renumbering entire portions of the network or re-assigning network services to different IP addresses.
b. The control plane allows traffic to be forwarded using Layer 2 addresses, thus allowing automatic load balance across the topology.
c. The separation allows fewer switches to be used in the data center topology, thus lowering costs.
d. All routes can be controlled and monitored from a central point of control.
e. A network controller can permit the renumbering of end hosts to have topology-dependent Layer 2 MAC addresses.
",,"a,d,e","a,d",,"The separation of control and data planes in software defined networking allows for easier management of data center networks in two key ways:  a) Virtual machines can be migrated within the network without the need to renumber network segments or re-assign services, since the control plane maintains a logical view separate from the physical topology. This enables greater flexibility.  d) Centralizing the control plane allows all routes to be programmed and monitored from a single point of control, rather than having to configure each network device individually. This simplifies management and troubleshooting.  The other options are incorrect or not directly enabled by separating the control and data planes.","['Software Defined Networks: A Comprehensive Approach by Paul Goransson and Chuck Black', 'Software Defined Networking (SDN): Anatomy of OpenFlow by Doug Marschke']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.95,1

c. Incorrect security policies.
d. Incorrect operation when one controller fails.
e. Forwarding loops.

d. Using different controllers for independent parts of the network.
e. Having multiple controllers install forwarding table entries on the same router and resolving the conflict on the router itself.
",,"a,b,c,d","a,d",,"Two viable approaches to handle inconsistency across controller replicas in SDN are:a) Running a consistency protocol across the controller replicas to ensure they maintain a consistent network state. This allows the replicas to synchronize their state.  d) Using different controllers for independent parts or domains of the network.

32,"Which property guarantees that each RCP replica continues to install correct forwarding state in the network data plane, even in the case of a partition in the data plane?","a. Each controller has a complete view of the portion of the network that it is controlling, and therefore can guarantee consistent routing within that partition.
b. The controller cannot see many of the routers in the network anyway, so there is no way for it to install incorrect routing state in the routers that it is not connected to.
c. The controllers are partitioned from the network routers, and the routers will fall back to running a distributed routing protocol.
d. Running the network from a single high-level control plane guarantees that network partitions and loops never occur in the first place.
