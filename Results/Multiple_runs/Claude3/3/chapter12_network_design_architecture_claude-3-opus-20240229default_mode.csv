204,"The customer edge device is typically a router, that sits at a customer site on MPLS networks and connects to a provider edge router (PE router) to take communications from a customer site to a provider side.","a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",,a,a,,"The statement is true. In MPLS networks, the customer edge (CE) device, which is typically a router, resides at the customer's premises. It connects to the provider edge (PE) router, which is the entry point into the service provider's MPLS network. The CE router is responsible for forwarding customer traffic to the PE router, which then transports the traffic across the provider's MPLS backbone.","['MPLS Fundamentals by Luc De Ghein, Cisco Press', 'RFC 4364 - BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)', 'Cisco Documentation: MPLS VPN Technology Overview']",1,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,1

b. Star
c. Hybrid
d. Partial Mesh
",,a,a,,"A full mesh network topology is one where each node (device) is connected directly to every other node in the network. In a full mesh topology, there is a dedicated link between each pair of nodes, providing high redundancy and reliability. However, this also requires a large number of connections which can be costly and complex to manage as the network grows.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1 by Wendell Odom, Chapter 3: Fundamentals of LANs', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/switches/what-is-a-network-topology.html']",1,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,1

211,Your company plans to start using public cloud service and now you are considering different WAN options. Your main concern is security by keeping the data private while also providing good QoS services. Which of the following options are under consideration? (Choose two answers.),"a. Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider
b. Using an Internet connection without VPN
c. Using an Internet connection with VPN
d. Using an intercloud exchange
",,"a,d","a,c",,"When connecting to public cloud services, the two best options for maintaining data privacy and providing good QoS are: a) Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider, which offers a dedicated, secure link; and c) Using an Internet connection with VPN, which encrypts data traffic over the public Internet. Using an Internet connection without VPN (b) does not provide data privacy. An intercloud exchange (d) is used for interconnecting different cloud providers, but does not specifically address security and QoS for connecting an enterprise WAN to a public cloud.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Wendell Odom, Chapter 14: WAN Architecture', 'Cloud Connect and Cloud Exchange explained, Aryaka Networks, https://www.aryaka.com/blog/cloud-connect-cloud-exchange-explained/']",0,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,1
