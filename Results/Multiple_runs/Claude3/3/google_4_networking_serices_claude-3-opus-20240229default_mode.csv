46,What transport layer protocol does DNS normally use?,"a. TCP
b. IP
c. UDP
d. ICMP
",,c,c,,"DNS normally uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) as its transport layer protocol. UDP provides a lightweight, connectionless service that is well-suited for the small query/response nature of most DNS lookups. UDP allows for faster transmission compared to TCP, as it has lower overhead and does not require establishing a connection before sending data. However, in certain cases, such as when the DNS response data exceeds the maximum UDP packet size (512 bytes), DNS may fall back to using TCP for transport to ensure reliable delivery of the complete response.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross', 'RFC 1035 - Domain Names - Implementation and Specification, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035']",1,google_4_networking_serices,0.95,1
