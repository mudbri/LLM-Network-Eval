You are responsible to find out why users are not being able to reach the Internet.","a. The cause is not related to dynamic NAT
b. The command output does not provide any clue to identify the problem
c. Dynamic NAT can't use Standard ACLs
d. The NAT pool does not have enough entries to fulfill the user's requests
",,d,d,,"The output shows that the NAT pool 'examsdigest' has a total of 10 addresses available, and all 10 are currently allocated (100% allocated). Additionally, there have been 595 'misses', meaning there were 595 attempts to allocate an address from the pool when no addresses were available. This indicates that the NAT pool is exhausted and does not have enough entries to fulfill all the user requests, preventing some users from accessing the Internet.","['Cisco CCNA Official Cert Guide, Chapter 10: Network Address Translation', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/network-address-translation-nat/13772-12.html']",1,chapter11_ip_services,0.95,1

b. FALSE
",,a,a,,Message integrity is indeed one of the key features introduced in SNMPv3.

",,b,b,,"The 'show cdp' command is used to display information about the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) configuration and status on a Cisco device. It will show whether CDP is enabled globally and on specific interfaces. The other options are incorrect because: - 'show protocols' displays the status of routing protocols, not CDP - 'show running-config' displays the entire running configuration, which would include CDP settings but is not the most direct way to check CDP status - 'show interface brief' provides a summary of interface status and configuration, but does not include CDP information","['Cisco IOS Network Management Command Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/netmgmt/command/nm-cr-book/nm-s1.html#wp3351566760', 'Cisco CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1, Chapter 12: Infrastructure Maintenance']",1,chapter11_ip_services,0.95,1

Host A and host B attach to the same LAN and have correct default router settings per the FHRP configuration. Which of the following statements is true for this LAN?","a. You can't connect two routers to the same LAN subnet.
b. If one router fails, hosts can't send packets off-subnet
c. If one router fails, both hosts will use the one remaining router as a default router
d. if one router fails, only one of the two hosts will still be able to send packets off-subnet
",,c,c,,"When two routers are connected to the same LAN subnet and configured with a First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP) like HSRP or VRRP, they provide redundancy for the default gateway. If one router fails, the other router will take over as the active router for the FHRP group. In this scenario, both hosts A and B have their default gateway set to the virtual IP address of the FHRP group. So if one router fails, both hosts will automatically start using the remaining router as their default gateway, allowing them to continue sending packets off-subnet.","['Cisco CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Wendell Odom, Chapter 16: First Hop Redundancy Protocol', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/hot-standby-router-protocol-hsrp/9234-hsrpguidetoc.html']",1,chapter11_ip_services,0.95,1

QoS can manage bandwidth (a) by allocating a minimum amount of bandwidth for certain types of traffic. It can manage packet loss (c) by prioritizing certain types of traffic and dropping lower priority packets first when congestion occurs. QoS can manage delay (d) by prioritizing delay-sensitive traffic like voice or video. Finally, QoS can manage jitter (f), the variation in delay, by using techniques like traffic shaping and policing to smooth out traffic patterns.
