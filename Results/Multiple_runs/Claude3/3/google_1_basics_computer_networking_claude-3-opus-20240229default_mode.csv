In contrast, half duplex communication only allows data transmission in one direction at a time, so while one device is transmitting, the other can only receive, and vice versa. The choice of full duplex or half duplex is not directly related to the use of hubs or switches, and full duplex is generally faster than half duplex as it allows for simultaneous two-way communication.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/lan-switching/ethernet/10563-full-half-duplex-csma-cd.html', 'https://www.comptia.org/content/guides/a-guide-to-network-troubleshooting/duplex-mismatch']",1,google_1_basics_computer_networking,0.95,1

d. USB Cable
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"The three main categories of Twisted Pair Ethernet cable are Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP), Foiled Twisted Pair (FTP), and Shielded Twisted Pair (STP). UTP has no shielding, making it more susceptible to electromagnetic interference but also cheaper and easier to install. FTP has foil shielding around each pair of wires to reduce crosstalk. STP has a metallic braid or foil that encases each pair of wires, providing better protection against EMI and crosstalk compared to UTP and FTP.
