137,"In a spoofing attack, which of the following parameters are commonly spoofed? (Choose two answers)","a. Source IP address
b. MAC address
c. ARP address
d. Routing table
e. Destination IP address
f. ARP table
",,"a,b","a,b",,"In a spoofing attack, the attacker typically falsifies or 'spoofs' the source IP address and/or the MAC address. By spoofing the source IP, the attacker can hide their true identity and location, making it appear as if the malicious traffic is originating from a different IP address. Similarly, by spoofing the MAC address, the attacker can impersonate a legitimate device on the network. The other choices - ARP address, routing table, destination IP address, and ARP table - are not commonly spoofed parameters in a spoofing attack.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 2, by Wendell Odom (Cisco Press, 2020)', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/what-is-spoofing.html', 'https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/spoofing-attack/']",1,chapter8_security_fundamentals,0.95,1
