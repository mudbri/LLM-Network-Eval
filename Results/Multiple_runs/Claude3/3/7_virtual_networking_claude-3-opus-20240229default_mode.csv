54,Which of the following properties are characteristics of virtual networks (but not necessarily characteristics of SDN). Select all that apply.,"a. Separates the data and control plane.
b. Refactors network control so that network behavior is controlled from a single logically centralized controller.
c. Separates logical and physical networks.
d. Often deployed in data center networks to allow multiple tenants to share physical network infrastructure.
e. Abstracts the details of the physical network.
",,"c,d,e","c,d,e",,"Virtual networks have the following key characteristics:  c) They separate the logical network topology from the underlying physical network infrastructure. Multiple virtual networks can be overlaid on the same physical network.  d) They are commonly used in multi-tenant data center environments to allow different tenants (customers) to share the same physical network hardware while keeping their traffic logically isolated.   e) Virtual networks abstract away the details and complexity of the physical network from the perspective of the virtual network users/tenants.  While virtual networks and SDN are related concepts that are often used together, characteristics (a) separating data and control planes and (b) logically centralized control are more specific to SDN rather than virtual networks in general.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_network', 'https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/virtual-networking', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/switches/what-is-a-virtual-network.html']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.95,1

Emulators provide a realistic environment where actual software can be executed, as opposed to simulations which model software behavior.The other options are not correct:a) Emulations are not necessarily faster than simulations.

61,Select the statement that is most true about the relationship between network virtualization and SDNs.,"a. Network virtualization is a potential enabler for software-defined networks, since the separation of data and control planes first requires the creation of a logical network.
b. Software-defined networking is a potential enabler for virtual networks, since separation of data and control planes makes it easier to manage a logical network topology.
c. Network virtualization is a new concept introduced by Amazon, Nicira, and industry players; it only made sense to talk about network virtualization once central SDN controllers existed.
d. Network virtualization and software-defined networking each enable the other: SDN cannot exist without network virtualization, and network virtualization cannot exist without SDN.
",,b,"a,b",,"Both statements a and b are true about the relationship between network virtualization and SDNs. Network virtualization enables the creation of logical networks separate from the underlying physical infrastructure, which is a prerequisite for separating the data and control planes in SDNs. At the same time, the separation of data and control planes in SDNs makes it easier to manage and orchestrate virtual network topologies. So network virtualization and SDN are complementary technologies that enable each other, but one is not strictly dependent on the other.","['https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/software-defined-networking', 'https://www.juniper.net/us/en/research-topics/what-is-network-virtualization.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/software-defined-networking/overview.html']",0,7_virtual_networking,0.9,1
