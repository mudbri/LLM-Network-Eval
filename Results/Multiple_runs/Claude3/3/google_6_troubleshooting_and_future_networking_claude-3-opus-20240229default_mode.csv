90,The protocol used to communicate network errors is known as __________.,"a. ICMP
b. Traceroute
c. TCP
d. UDP

94,"During a traceroute, which action does a router perform to the value in the Time To Live (TTL) field?","a. Multiplication
b. Division
c. Subtraction
d. Addition
",,c,c,,"During a traceroute, each router that receives the packet subtracts one from the Time To Live (TTL) value before forwarding the packet to the next hop. When a router receives a packet with a TTL value of 1, it discards the packet and sends an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the source, indicating that the packet's TTL has expired. This process allows traceroute to map the route and measure transit delays of packets across an IP network.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross', 'RFC 1393 - Traceroute Using an IP Option']",1,google_6_troubleshooting_and_future_networking,0.95,1
