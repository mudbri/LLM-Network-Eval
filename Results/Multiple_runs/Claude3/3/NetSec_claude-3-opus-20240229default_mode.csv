",,c,c,,"DHCP snooping is a Cisco switch feature that can help mitigate DHCP attacks. It works by monitoring DHCP messages between DHCP clients and servers, and filtering out untrusted or rogue DHCP server messages. DHCP snooping builds a binding table to track legitimate DHCP leases, and drops DHCP messages from untrusted sources. This prevents attackers from setting up unauthorized DHCP servers to perform attacks like DHCP starvation or rogue DHCP server spoofing.","['Cisco Networking Academy: CCNA Routing and Switching - DHCP Snooping', 'Cisco Press: CCNA Security 210-260 Official Cert Guide - Chapter 7: Mitigating Layer 2 Attacks']",1,NetSec,0.95,1
