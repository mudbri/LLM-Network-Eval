b. Multicast address
c. IP address
d. MAC address
e. Unicast address
",,"a,b","a,b",,"Ethernet addresses that can send one frame to be delivered to multiple devices on a LAN are described by broadcast and multicast addresses. A broadcast address allows a frame to be sent to all devices on the LAN, while a multicast address enables sending a frame to a specific group of devices on the LAN. IP address, MAC address, and unicast address do not fit this description as they are used for sending frames to a single specific device.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1 by Wendell Odom (Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs)', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,0.95,1
