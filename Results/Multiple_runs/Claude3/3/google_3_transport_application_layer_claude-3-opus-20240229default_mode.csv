36,What ordering of TCP flags make up the Three-Way Handshake?,"a. SYN, ACK, FIN
b. SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK
c. FIN, FIN/ACK, ACK
d. SYN, ACK, SYN, ACK
",,b,b,,"The Three-Way Handshake in TCP connection establishment consists of SYN (synchronize), SYN/ACK (synchronize/acknowledge), and ACK (acknowledge) flags in that order. The client sends a SYN packet to initiate the connection, the server responds with a SYN/ACK to acknowledge the client's SYN and establish its own sequence number, and finally the client sends an ACK to acknowledge the server's SYN, completing the handshake.","['TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols by W.

37,"Transport layer protocols, like TCP and UDP, introduce the concept of a port. How many bits are in a port field?","a. 16
b. 4
c. 32
d. 8
",,a,a,,The port field in transport layer protocols like TCP and UDP is 16 bits long. This allows for port numbers ranging from 0 to 65535. The 16-bit size provides a balance between having a sufficient number of ports for various services while keeping the header size manageable.,"['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross', 'TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols by W.

38,A device that blocks traffic that meets certain criteria is known as a ________.,"a. Hub
b. Router
c. Switch
d. Firewall
",,d,d,,"A firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies. It acts as a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network, such as the Internet. Firewalls can block traffic that meets certain criteria, such as traffic from specific IP addresses, ports, or applications.","['NIST Special Publication 800-41 Revision 1: Guidelines on Firewalls and Firewall Policy', 'Cisco Networking Academy: Introduction to Networks v7.0 (ITN)', 'CompTIA Security+ (SY0-601) Certification Study Guide']",1,google_3_transport_application_layer,0.95,1
39,Which TCP flag is used to make the listening program respond immediately?,"a. ACK
b. PSH
c. URG
d. RST
",,b,b,,"The PSH (push) flag is used to request immediate processing of the data in the receiving program's input buffer. When the PSH flag is set, the receiving program is notified to process the buffered data immediately rather than waiting for additional incoming data or a timeout. This allows for prioritizing the delivery of certain segments to the application layer.","['TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols by W.

40,_________are identified as ports 49152 through 65535.,"a. User ports
b. Ephemeral ports
c. Sockets
d. System ports
",,b,b,,Ephemeral ports are identified as ports 49152 through 65535. These are temporary ports assigned by the client's IP stack when a client application requests an outbound connection. They are used for the duration of the client/server session and then released back into the pool when the session ends.,"['IANA Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml)', 'TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows, Chapter 4 - Transmission Control Protocol (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/tcp-ip-fundamentals)']",1,google_3_transport_application_layer,0.95,1
41,"Unlike our five-layer model, the OSI network model adds two more layers on top of the Application Layer. Select examples of these new layers below.","a. The compression layer
b. The session layer
c. The interconnection layer
d. The presentation layer
",,"b,d","b,d",,"The OSI model adds the Session layer and Presentation layer on top of the Application layer compared to the five-layer model. The Session layer manages sessions between applications, while the Presentation layer handles data formatting, encryption, and compression.

42,An example of something that operates at the application layer is:,"a. UDP
b. A router
c. TCP
d. A web browser
",,d,d,,"A web browser operates at the application layer of the OSI model. The application layer is the topmost layer that interacts directly with the user and provides services for user applications. Web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc. are software applications that retrieve, present and traverse information on the World Wide Web. They use application layer protocols like HTTP/HTTPS to communicate with web servers. UDP, TCP operate at the transport layer while routers operate at the network layer, so those choices are incorrect.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer', 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/layers-of-osi-model/']",1,google_3_transport_application_layer,0.95,1
44,Which part of the operating system does the application use to communicate the need to establish a TCP connection?,"a. Networking stack
b. ARP message
c. The source port
d. The router
",,a,a,,"The networking stack is the part of the operating system that applications use to communicate their need to establish network connections, including TCP connections. The networking stack handles the details of setting up the connection, managing the flow of data, and closing the connection when finished.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross', 'TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols by W.

45,Which of the following sections of the TCP/IP Five-Layer Network Model contain the data the application wants to send? Select all that apply.,"a. The payload section of the Ethernet frame
b. The payload section of the IP Datagram
c. The payload of the TCP segment
d. The header of the Ethernet frame
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"The payload sections of the Ethernet frame, IP datagram, and TCP segment all contain the data that the application wants to send. As data moves down the TCP/IP layers, each layer encapsulates the data from the layer above, adding its own header information. The application data remains in the payload section at each layer. The Ethernet frame header does not contain application data, only frame-specific information.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross', 'TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols by W.
