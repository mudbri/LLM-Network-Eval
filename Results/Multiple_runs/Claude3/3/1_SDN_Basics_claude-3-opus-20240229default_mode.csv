1,Which of the following are true about Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)? Select all that apply.,"a. The only sizes for an IP address allocation before CIDR were 8, 16, or 24 bits.
b. The prefix length for a CIDR prefix can be anywhere in the range from 0 to 32 bits.
c. In an Internet forwarding table with CIDR, there can only be one unique matching entry for any given IP address.
d. CIDR slowed the rate of Internet routing table growth because prefixes no longer had to be allocated in fixed-size blocks.
",,"b,d","b,d",,"CIDR allows for variable-length subnet masks, with prefix lengths ranging from 0 to 32 bits. This flexibility in prefix length allocation helped slow the growth of Internet routing tables by allowing more efficient aggregation of IP address blocks, rather than being limited to fixed sizes. While there were common fixed allocation sizes like /8, /16, and /24 before CIDR, other sizes were possible. Also, with CIDR, a given IP address can match multiple forwarding table entries, with the longest matching prefix used.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
2,Which of the following are true about how DNS lookups work? Select all that apply.,"a. A DNS A-record query for google.com will only return a single IP address at a time.
b. An NS-record query for a DNS lookup will return the name(s) of the authoritative name server(s) for that domain.
c. If your local DNS resolver caches an NS record for google.com for multiple days, all clients who use that DNS resolver will continue using the same IP address to reach Google’s Web server until that NS record expires.
d. An MX-record query for a DNS lookup will return the IP address of the mail server for that domain.
e. All DNS PTR records are maintained by a single organization in-addr.arpa.
",,b,b,,"Only choice b is correct. An NS-record query returns the name(s) of the authoritative name server(s) for the queried domain. Choice a is incorrect because an A-record can return multiple IP addresses. Choice c is wrong because NS records contain name server names, not IP addresses, so caching them does not fix the IP used to reach a web server. Choice d is incorrect as MX records contain mail server names, not IP addresses. Choice e is false because PTR records are delegated and maintained by the owner of each IP address block.","['DNS and BIND, 5th Edition by Cricket Liu and Paul Albitz', 'RFC 1035 - Domain Names - Implementation and Specification', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
3,Which of the following are true about traffic control with BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
b. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
c. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
d. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
",,"a,b","a,c",,"A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control outbound traffic from their AS to a destination. The local preference is used to prefer certain paths out of the AS over others. BGP AS path prepending can also be used to control outbound traffic by making certain paths appear longer and less preferred to other ASes, causing them to prefer alternate paths. However, a network operator cannot directly control inbound traffic to their AS using either the local preference attribute or AS path prepending. Inbound traffic control requires cooperation from other ASes.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross, Section 4.3 on inter-AS routing and BGP', 'BGP Traffic Engineering Techniques, Cisco Press, https://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2180358']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
4,Which of the following are true about layering? Select all that apply.,"a. The network layer guarantees reliable, in-order delivery of packets.
b. The network layer has only a single protocol in widespread use today, representing what we call the “narrow waist”.
c. The transport layer uses port numbers.
d. The destination address in the link layer header is always the address of the next layer-3 node along an end-to-end IP path.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"Option b is correct because the network layer, which uses IP as its core protocol, represents the 'narrow waist' of the Internet protocol stack. IP is the single protocol that enables global connectivity at the network layer. Option c is also correct as the transport layer protocols like TCP and UDP use port numbers to multiplex and demultiplex data to/from the correct application processes. Option a is incorrect because reliable, in-order delivery is the responsibility of the transport layer if using TCP, not the network layer. The network layer provides best-effort delivery. Option d is incorrect because the link layer destination address is the address of the next layer-2 hop (e.g. the next router or the final host), not necessarily the next layer-3 node.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross, Chapter 1.5', 'TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols by W.

5,Which of the following are not true about packet switching? Select all that apply.,"a. Once a connection is established between two endpoints in a packet switched network, the end-to-end route cannot change, or the connection must be re-established.
b. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will always experience predictable latency.
c. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will never be dropped by intermediate nodes along the path.
d. A user of a packet switched network might occasionally get a “busy signal” if there are too many users on the network.
",,"a,b,c,d","a,b,c,d",,"All of the given choices are false statements about packet switching:a) In packet switching, each packet is independently routed, so the end-to-end route can change without re-establishing the connection. b) Latency in packet-switched networks is variable and unpredictable due to factors like queuing delays and changing routes.c) Packets can be dropped by intermediate nodes if their buffers are full or for other reasons like congestion control.d) Packet-switched networks do not have the concept of a ""busy signal"". If the network or destination is congested, packets will be queued or dropped, but the user will not receive a busy signal.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching', 'Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach (7th Edition) by Kurose and Ross']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
6,Which of the following are true about content distribution networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Content distribution networks can improve the performance that a client sees by reducing the network latency between the client and the content that it is downloading.
b. Content distribution networks can reduce transit expenses for a content provider by enabling much of the provider’s content to be served from a nearby network, sometimes even from a cache that is within the client’s own network.
c. Real-time content such as video streams cannot be distributed from a content distribution network.
d. Content distribution networks typically redirect Web clients to a nearby Web cache by rewriting the IP address of packets sent from the client to the IP address of the nearby Web cache.
",,"a,b","a,b",,"Content distribution networks (CDNs) can improve client performance by reducing network latency, as the content is served from a nearby cache rather than the origin server which may be geographically distant (a). CDNs can also reduce transit costs for the content provider, as much of the content is served from caches within the client's network or nearby, reducing the need to transfer data over long distances (b). However, CDNs are capable of distributing real-time content like video streams (c is incorrect). CDNs typically redirect clients to a nearby cache by rewriting URLs to point to the cache's domain name, not by rewriting IP addresses (d is incorrect).","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach (7th Edition) by Kurose and Ross, Section 2.4', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/', 'https://www.akamai.com/our-thinking/cdn/what-is-a-cdn']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
7,Which of the following are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control? Select all that apply.,"a. Only wireless networks can have collisions at the receiver; such collisions are not possible on wired Ethernet networks.
b. Using RTS/CTS (“request to send”, “clear to send”) control reduces the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network.
c. A wireless sender can avoid causing a collision at the receiver by performing a “carrier sense” to determine whether any other sender wants to transmit at the time that it wishes to send a packet.
d. Disabling RTS/CTS necessarily lowers the effective throughput of the wireless network, since more collisions will occur at the receiver without RTS/CTS enabled.
",,b,"b,c",,"Both options b and c are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control. Using RTS/CTS control adds overhead and reduces the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network (b). A wireless sender can avoid causing collisions at the receiver by performing carrier sensing to determine if any other sender wants to transmit at the same time (c). Option a is false because collisions can occur on wired Ethernet networks too. Option d is false because disabling RTS/CTS does not necessarily lower throughput, as it reduces overhead which can improve throughput in some cases despite potentially more collisions.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross, Chapter 6: Wireless and Mobile Networks', 'IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN standard']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
8,Which of the following are true about video streaming? Select all that apply.,"a. Using UDP to stream a video instead of TCP is appropriate if the client is more concerned about low delay and interactivity than it does about receiving a high-quality stream.
b. A larger playout buffer at the client allows the client more time to recover from lost packets.
c. Using TCP for video streaming could result in larger delays between transmission and playout than streaming the same video with UDP.
d. Since UDP provides no reliable delivery guarantees, a video streaming application that uses UDP as its transport cannot recover from any packet loss in the video stream.
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"Using UDP for video streaming is more appropriate when low delay and interactivity are prioritized over receiving a high-quality stream, since UDP does not have the overhead of reliability mechanisms like TCP (a). A larger playout buffer at the client allows more time to recover from lost packets by smoothing out the playback (b). TCP's reliability mechanisms like retransmission of lost packets can introduce larger delays compared to UDP which has no such mechanisms (c). However, (d) is incorrect because even when using UDP, a video streaming application can employ its own techniques like error correction or selective retransmission to recover from some degree of packet loss.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross, Section 7.2', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_Transport_Protocol']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
9,Which of the following are true about TCP? Select all that apply.,"a. TCP guarantees that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted.
b. A TCP sender and receiver use a “three-way handshake” both to set up and to terminate the TCP connection.
c. TCP’s congestion avoidance algorithm causes the sender to reduce its sending rate by a factor of two when it sees a packet loss.
d. A TCP sender controls its sending rate by adjusting the number of unacknowledged packets that can be sent over the network at any time.
",,"a,c,d","a,d",,"TCP guarantees reliable, in-order delivery of a stream of bytes from sender to receiver (a). The sender controls its transmission rate by limiting the number of unacknowledged packets in flight, known as the congestion window (d). While TCP does use a three-way handshake to establish a connection, it uses a four-way handshake to terminate the connection (b is incorrect). When packet loss is detected, TCP reduces the congestion window by a factor other than two, depending on the specific congestion control algorithm in use (c is incorrect).","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross, Section 3.5', 'TCP congestion control: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
10,Which of the following are true about denial of service attacks (and defenses)? Select all that apply.,"a. If every network on the Internet performed stateless ingress filtering to defend against source IP spoofing, the DNS reflection attack would not work.
b. If every network on the Internet performed stateless egress filtering to defend against source IP address spoofing, the DNS reflection attack could not be carried out.
c. In a “SYN Flood” attack, each TCP SYN packet that a victim receives causes it to set up TCP connection state.
d. A “DNS Reflection” attack requires the attacking client to “spoof” the source IP address of the packet containing the DNS request.
",,"b,c,d","b,c,d",,"Choices b, c, and d are correct about denial of service attacks and defenses:b) If every network performed egress filtering to prevent source IP spoofing, attackers could not spoof the victim's IP as the source of DNS requests, so reflection attacks would fail.  c) In a SYN flood, each SYN packet causes the victim to allocate resources for a half-open TCP connection, potentially exhausting resources.d) DNS reflection requires the attacker to spoof the victim's IP as the source of DNS requests, so the amplified responses are directed to the victim.Choice a is incorrect because ingress filtering at the destination does not prevent reflection attacks that rely on source IP spoofing.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/ip-spoofing/', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/dns-amplification-ddos-attack/', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/syn-flood-ddos-attack/']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
