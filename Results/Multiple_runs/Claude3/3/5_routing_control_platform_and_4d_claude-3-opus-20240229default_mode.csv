32,What are some of the reasons that it is difficult to deploy improvements to BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. Changes are necessarily incremental because of the large installed base of routers that already run BGP.
b. BGP is implemented in hardware, so deploying changes to BGP requires changes on the timescale of hardware development cycles.
c. Deplyoing changes to BGP requires coordination across potentially tens of thousands of ASes in the Internet.
d. Only a few vendors implement BGP, and deploying changes requires convincing those vendors to change the protocol.
e. Deploying changes requires coordination in standards bodies such as the IETF.

34,"Which of the following are true about network management with BGP, in the absence of RCP? Select all that apply.","a. BGP's interaction with the underlying routing IGP routing protocol can result in persistent forwarding loops.
b. Implementing network-wide policy sometimes causes the routers themeselves to have to carry state.
c. Each router operates and makes decisions based only on a local view of network state.
d. BGP routing has a single point of failure.
e. It is not possible to perform traffic engineering with conventional BGP.
",,"a,b,c","b,c",,"In the absence of RCP, network management with BGP has a couple of key limitations:b) Implementing network-wide policies can require the routers themselves to maintain state in order to enforce those policies. The routers need to be configured with the policy details.  c) With BGP, each router makes routing decisions independently based on its own local view of the network state obtained from exchanging routing information with its peers. It does not have a global view of the entire network.a) While suboptimal routing can occur due to interaction between BGP and the IGP, persistent forwarding loops are unlikely as BGP has loop prevention mechanisms.d) BGP is a distributed protocol without a single point of failure. If one BGP router fails, the protocol adapts and routes around it.e) Traffic engineering is possible with BGP using techniques like AS path prepending, community tagging, and selective advertisement, although it is more complex than with a centralized controller.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross, Section 4.3 on Routing Protocols', 'RFC 4271 - A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)', 'IETF draft: BGP Traffic Engineering Techniques (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-idr-bgp-traffic-engineering/)']",0,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.85,1
