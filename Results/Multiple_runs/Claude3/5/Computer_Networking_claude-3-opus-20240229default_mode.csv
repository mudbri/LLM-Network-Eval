",,a,a,,"Ad-hoc mode allows wireless devices to connect directly to each other without the need for a central access point or router. Devices in ad-hoc mode form a peer-to-peer network where they communicate directly with one another. Infrastructure mode, on the other hand, requires devices to connect through a central access point. Mesh networking involves devices connecting to each other and the internet via multiple access points. Wi-Fi Direct is a standard that enables devices to connect directly, but it is not the same as the general concept of ad-hoc mode.","[""Wireless Networking Absolute Beginner's Guide by Michael Miller (2013)"", 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/wireless/what-is-ad-hoc-mode.html', 'https://www.lifewire.com/infrastructure-mode-in-wireless-networking-816539']",1,Computer_Networking,0.95,1

In a mesh network, the access points communicate with each other to extend the wireless coverage area and provide redundancy. If one access point fails, the others can still route traffic. Ad-hoc mode and Wi-Fi Direct are used for direct device-to-device communication without an access point. Infrastructure mode uses a central access point but the access points operate independently.","['CompTIA Network+ Certification All-in-One Exam Guide, Seventh Edition (Exam N10-007) by Mike Meyers', 'Networking All-in-One For Dummies, 7th Edition by Doug Lowe']",1,Computer_Networking,0.95,1
