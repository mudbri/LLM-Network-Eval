b. Make software routers faster by reducing the need to copy packets from the kernel into user space.
c. Send all traffic through software switches running in user space.
d. Make software routers faster by distributing software routers across clusters.
e. Make software routers faster by amortizing packet-processing costs across batches of packets.
",,"a,b,d,e","b,d,e",,"Making software routers faster can be achieved through several approaches:b) Reducing the need to copy packets between kernel and user space eliminates unnecessary data movement overhead. d) Distributing software routers across clusters allows parallel processing of traffic.e) Processing batches of packets amortizes the fixed costs associated with each packet.While custom hardware (a) is an option, the question focuses on software approaches.

",,c,c,,"In Click, elements can be composed to perform complex data plane functions like the forwarding operations of an IP router. Elements in Click are modular components that encapsulate specific packet processing functionality. By connecting elements together, Click allows building complex packet processing pipelines.

117,Why does a RouteBricks server assign one core per queue?,"a. Having multiple cores accessing the same queue would require each core to perform only one function in the packet processing pipeline, which is inefficient.
b. Having multiple cores accessing the same queue would require locking to prevent concurrent memory accesses, slowing packet forwarding performance.
c. Having multiple cores accessing the same queue might create the possibility that there is a queue that is not served by any cores.
d. Cores have heterogeneous performance, and packets are different sizes, so it makes sense to assign less powerful cores to queues that have smaller packets.
",,b,b,,"The correct answer is b. Having multiple cores accessing the same queue would require locking mechanisms to prevent concurrent memory accesses to the shared queue. This locking overhead would slow down the packet forwarding performance. By assigning one core per queue, RouteBricks avoids the need for locking and allows each core to process packets from its dedicated queue independently, maximizing throughput and efficiency.","['RouteBricks: Exploiting Parallelism to Scale Software Routers, Dobrescu et al., SOSP 2009', 'https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos597E/papers/RouteBricks09.pdf']",1,10_programmable_data_planes,0.95,1
118,What are some tricks commonly employed in software to accelerate packet forwarding? Select all that apply.,"a. Ethernet GRE tunnels
b. Large packet buffers that hold multiple packets that can be read with a single read
c. Forwarding smaller packets before larger packets
d. Avoiding lookups on the software bridge between virtual interfaces and physical interfaces
e. Batch processing
",,"a,b,d,e","b,e",,"Two common techniques used to accelerate packet forwarding in software are:b) Using large packet buffers that can hold multiple packets. This allows multiple packets to be read with a single read operation, reducing the overhead of multiple reads.  e) Batch processing packets. By processing a batch of packets together, various overheads like lookups and state updates can be amortized over the batch, improving overall throughput.The other options are not directly relevant to accelerating packet forwarding in software. Ethernet GRE tunnels, prioritizing smaller packets, and avoiding lookups on software bridges may have their use cases but are not general techniques for faster packet processing in software.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross', 'https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/scaling.html']",0,10_programmable_data_planes,0.9,1
