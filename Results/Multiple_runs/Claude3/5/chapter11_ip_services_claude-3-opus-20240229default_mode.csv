194,"Examine the following show command output on a router configured for dynamic NAT:
""â€” Inside Source
access-list 1 pool examsdigest
pool examsdigest: netmask 255.255.255.240

type generic, total addresses 10, allocated 10 (100%), misses 595""
You are responsible to find out why users are not being able to reach the Internet.","a. The cause is not related to dynamic NAT
b. The command output does not provide any clue to identify the problem
c. Dynamic NAT can't use Standard ACLs
d. The NAT pool does not have enough entries to fulfill the user's requests
",,d,d,,"The output shows that the NAT pool 'examsdigest' has a total of 10 addresses available, and all 10 have been allocated (100% utilization). Additionally, there have been 595 misses, meaning there were 595 attempts to allocate an address from the pool when no addresses were available. This indicates that the NAT pool is exhausted and does not have enough entries to fulfill all the user requests, preventing some users from reaching the Internet.","['Cisco CCNA Official Cert Guide, Chapter 10: Network Address Translation', 'Cisco Documentation: Configuring Dynamic NAT - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipaddr_nat/configuration/15-mt/nat-15-mt-book/iadnat-addr-consv.html']",1,chapter11_ip_services,0.95,1

b. 3
c. 4
d. 5
",,c,c,,"In Cisco IOS, severity level 4 corresponds to warning messages. These messages indicate a warning condition that should be monitored and addressed to prevent issues.

d. 5

198,One of the features of SNMPv3 is called message integrity.,"a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",,a,a,,Message integrity is indeed one of the key features introduced in SNMPv3. It ensures that SNMP messages have not been altered or corrupted in transit by using authentication mechanisms like HMAC-MD5 or HMAC-SHA. This provides protection against tampering and unauthorized modifications to the SNMP messages.,"['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1 by Wendell Odom', 'Network Management Fundamentals by Alexander Clemm', 'RFC 3414 - User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)']",1,chapter11_ip_services,0.95,1

b. SMTP
c. UDP
d. CDP
",,a,a,,"NTP (Network Time Protocol) is used to synchronize the clocks of computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks. It allows network devices to maintain accurate timekeeping by periodically querying a set of servers that provide a highly accurate time source. SMTP is used for email, UDP is a transport protocol, and CDP is a Cisco proprietary protocol for device discovery, none of which are used for time synchronization.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Wendell Odom, Cisco Press', 'Network Time Protocol (NTP) General Overview, Cisco Documentation']",1,chapter11_ip_services,0.95,1

Host A and host B attach to the same LAN and have correct default router settings per the FHRP configuration. Which of the following statements is true for this LAN?","a. You can't connect two routers to the same LAN subnet.
b. If one router fails, hosts can't send packets off-subnet
c. If one router fails, both hosts will use the one remaining router as a default router
d. if one router fails, only one of the two hosts will still be able to send packets off-subnet
",,c,c,,"In a LAN with two routers using a First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP) like HSRP or VRRP, if one router fails, the other router will take over as the active router. All hosts on the LAN will then use the remaining router as their default gateway to send packets off-subnet. The FHRP ensures that there is always an active router available to forward traffic, providing redundancy and preventing a single point of failure.","['Cisco CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1, Chapter 16: First Hop Redundancy Protocol', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/hot-standby-router-protocol-hsrp/9234-hsrpguidetoc.html']",1,chapter11_ip_services,0.95,1
