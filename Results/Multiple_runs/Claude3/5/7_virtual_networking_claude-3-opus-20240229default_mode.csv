54,Which of the following properties are characteristics of virtual networks (but not necessarily characteristics of SDN). Select all that apply.,"a. Separates the data and control plane.
b. Refactors network control so that network behavior is controlled from a single logically centralized controller.
c. Separates logical and physical networks.
d. Often deployed in data center networks to allow multiple tenants to share physical network infrastructure.
e. Abstracts the details of the physical network.
",,"c,d,e","c,d,e",,"Virtual networks have the following key characteristics:  c) They separate the logical network topology from the underlying physical network infrastructure. Multiple virtual networks can be overlaid on the same physical network.  d) They are commonly used in multi-tenant data center environments to allow different tenants (customers) to share the same physical network hardware while keeping their traffic isolated. Each tenant gets their own virtual network.  e) The virtual network abstracts away the details and complexity of the physical network from the perspective of the virtual network user or tenant. The virtual network presents a simplified logical topology.  While virtual networks and SDN are related concepts that are often used together, properties (a) and (b) are more specific to SDN. Separation of data and control planes and logically centralized control are key tenets of SDN but not necessarily virtual networks in general.","['https://www.networkworld.com/article/3209131/what-is-a-virtual-network-what-are-the-benefits-of-creating-one.html', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/virtualization/definitions/virtual-networking/']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.95,1
55,Which of the following are possible ways of creating virtual links in a virtual network? Select all that apply.,"a. A wide-area tunnel, whereby an IP packet is encapsulated in an MPLS tunnel by attaching an MPLS header to the packet.
b. Longest-prefix match forwarding on an IP router.
c. A wide-area tunnel, whereby an Ethernet packet sent between two virtual machines is encapsulated in an IP packet.
d. VLAN switching based on a VLAN tag.
e. Pairs of virtual Ethernet interfaces, where one end of the Ethernet interface pair resides in the virtual environment, and the other resides in the root namespace on the host machine.
",,"a,c,d,e","a,c,d,e",,"Virtual links in a virtual network can be created in several ways. Encapsulating IP packets in MPLS tunnels (a) or Ethernet packets in IP tunnels (c) enables virtual links across wide-area networks. VLAN switching based on tags (d) allows virtual links on the same physical network. Virtual Ethernet interface pairs (e) create virtual links between VMs and the host.

56,Which of the following are true of the Mininet network emulator? Select all that apply.,"a. It requires running OpenFlow-capable switches.
b. It is difficult to use it to route traffic for real services.
c. Mininet only allows users to create three types of topologies: linear, tree, and single-switch topologies.
d. It can create an emulation that runs across multiple physically distributed nodes.
e. All of the hosts in the topology must run the same underlying operating system.
",,"b,e","b,e",,"Mininet does not require running OpenFlow-capable switches, as it can emulate OpenFlow switches in software. It is difficult to use Mininet to route traffic for real services because the emulated network is contained within a single machine and has limited connectivity to the outside world. Mininet allows users to create arbitrary network topologies, not just linear, tree, and single-switch topologies. While Mininet can create an emulation that runs on a single machine, it cannot distribute the emulation across multiple physically distributed nodes. All hosts in a Mininet topology run the same underlying operating system as the machine running the emulation.","['https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Introduction-to-Mininet', 'https://www.coursera.org/lecture/sdn/mininet-overview-kAy8t']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.95,1
57,"What are the benefits of emulation as opposed to, say, simulation? Select all that apply.","a. An emulation will complete faster than a simulation.
b. An emulator makes it possible to ""port"" experiments from one machine to another.
c. An emulator allows the experimenter run real software on each of the nodes in the emulation.
d. An emulation is easier to debug than a simulation.
e. Every run of the emulator will yield exactly the same results, resulting in reproducible experiments.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"The key benefits of emulation over simulation are:b) An emulator allows experiments to be 'ported' or moved from one physical machine to another. This is because the emulator abstracts the underlying hardware, making the emulation platform-independent.  c) In an emulation, real software can be run on each emulated node. This allows testing and experimentation with actual applications and operating systems, providing a more realistic environment.Emulation is not necessarily faster than simulation (a), may not be easier to debug (d), and does not guarantee deterministic results across runs (e) as those depend on the emulated software's behavior.","['https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/emulation', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.9,1

61,Select the statement that is most true about the relationship between network virtualization and SDNs.,"a. Network virtualization is a potential enabler for software-defined networks, since the separation of data and control planes first requires the creation of a logical network.
b. Software-defined networking is a potential enabler for virtual networks, since separation of data and control planes makes it easier to manage a logical network topology.
c. Network virtualization is a new concept introduced by Amazon, Nicira, and industry players; it only made sense to talk about network virtualization once central SDN controllers existed.
d. Network virtualization and software-defined networking each enable the other: SDN cannot exist without network virtualization, and network virtualization cannot exist without SDN.
",,b,"a,b",,"Both statements a and b are true about the relationship between network virtualization and SDNs. Network virtualization enables the creation of logical networks separate from the underlying physical infrastructure, which is a prerequisite for separating the data and control planes in SDNs. At the same time, the separation of data and control planes in SDNs makes it easier to manage and orchestrate virtual network topologies. So network virtualization and SDN are complementary technologies that enable each other, rather than one being strictly dependent on the other.","['https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/software-defined-networking', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/software-defined-networking/what-is-sdn.html', 'https://www.juniper.net/us/en/research-topics/what-is-network-virtualization.html']",0,7_virtual_networking,0.9,1
