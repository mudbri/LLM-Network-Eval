62,Which of the following are true of “network slicing”? Select all that apply.,"a. Network operators can use slicing to test configurations on “shadow” networks that mirror a production network topology.
b. One way to slice networks is according to “flow space”, whereby different controllers might control distinct and non-overlapping traffic flows.
c. A controller can prevent one network slice from interfering with the resources of another.
d. Multi-tenant datacenters are one use case for network slicing.
e. Conventional (i.e., non-SDN) networks have no concept of network virtualization or slicing.
",,"a,b,d","a,b,c,d",,"Network slicing allows creating multiple logical networks over a shared physical infrastructure. Operators can use slicing to test configurations on isolated 'shadow' networks mirroring production (a). Slicing can be done based on non-overlapping traffic flows, with different controllers managing each slice (b). The controller can enforce isolation to prevent resource interference between slices (c). Multi-tenant datacenters are a key use case, enabling tenants to get their own virtual network slice (d). However, conventional networks do have forms of network virtualization like VLANs, so (e) is incorrect.","['https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/nfv/definitions/what-is-network-slicing/', 'https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-definition/', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/network-slicing/white-paper-c11-741498.html']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.95,1
63,Which of the following are true about flow spaces? Select all that apply.,"a. Two flow spaces cannot overlap.
b. One host could send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces.
c. Flow spaces can only be defined according to combinations of packet header fields.
d. Flowspace isolation separates individual virtual networks from one another but incurs some performance penalty for doing so.
e. Two controllers that write data-plane rules for non-overlapping parts of flowspace can never cause traffic from one “slice” to enter the other slice.
",,b,"b,d",,"Two flow spaces can overlap, as one host could send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces (b). Flow spaces are not limited to only packet header field combinations - they can be defined based on switch ports, VLAN tags, etc. (c is incorrect). Flowspace isolation does separate virtual networks but comes with a performance cost (d). Even with non-overlapping flow space rules, improper configuration or bugs could still allow traffic to cross between slices (e is incorrect).","['https://www.opennetworking.org/images/stories/downloads/sdn-resources/technical-reports/Flowspace-Virtualization-Principles-and-Practices.pdf', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128614003703']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,1
64,Which of the following describe the control-plane checks that FlowVisor implements? Select all that apply.,"a. When a packet must be forwarded to a controller, Flowvisor forwards traffic to the correct controller based on which controller “owns” the flowspace corresponding to that packet.
b. Flowvisor prevents each slice's controller from being the target of a denial of service attack from other slices.
c. Flowvisor can only instantiate network slices based on the network topology, not based on other properties, such as application traffic.
d. Flowvisor prevents a controller from writing data-plane rules to a part of flowspace that it does not own.
e. Flowvisor installs traffic shaping and quality of service rules to ensure that each network slice has guaranteed resources.
",,"a,d","a,d",,"FlowVisor performs two key control-plane checks:a) It forwards packets to the correct controller slice based on the flowspace ownership. This ensures each controller only receives traffic from its assigned slice.  d) It prevents a controller from modifying data-plane rules (flow entries) in switches for flowspace it doesn't own. This isolates slices from interfering with each other.b) Preventing DoS between slices is not explicitly mentioned as a FlowVisor function.c) FlowVisor can slice the network based on various flow space fields, not just topology. e) Implementing QoS and traffic shaping per slice is not a core FlowVisor responsibility.","['https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos597E/papers/flowvisor-nsdi09.pdf', 'https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/flowvisor-latest.pdf']",1,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,1

b. Traceback of attack traffic to its source
c. Smart grid applications
d. Load balance of inbound traffic
e. Guest WiFi access
",,"a,c,e","a,c,e",,Network slicing in a home network could enable:a) Quality of service for certain applications like video streaming by dedicating specific network resources to ensure a good user experience.  c) Smart grid applications by providing a separate secure slice for energy monitoring and control devices to operate on.e) Guest WiFi access by creating an isolated network slice for visitors to use without compromising the security of the main home network.Choices b and d are more relevant to service provider or enterprise networks rather than a typical home network.,"['https://www.ericsson.com/en/blog/2021/6/network-slicing-for-5g-and-beyond', 'https://www.nokia.com/networks/insights/what-is-network-slicing/', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/5g/definitions/5g-network-slicing/']",1,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,1
69,What are examples of multi-tenant datacenter applications? Select all that apply.,"a. Amazon hosting EC2 instances for customers
b. A home network owner running a private and public WiFi network
c. A retailer running a large, multi-site enterprise network across its global network of sites
d. Google running Gmail and search from a common facility
e. Two enterprises hosting data in a shared facility.
",,"a,d,e","a,d,e",,"Multi-tenant datacenter applications involve multiple customers or tenants sharing common computing resources and infrastructure. Amazon hosting EC2 instances for customers (a) is an example of multi-tenancy, where Amazon's datacenter infrastructure is shared among many EC2 customers. Similarly, Google running Gmail and search from a common facility (d) represents multi-tenancy, as the same datacenter hosts services for many end users. Two enterprises hosting data in a shared facility (e) is another case of multi-tenancy. In contrast, a home network owner running private and public WiFi (b) and a retailer's multi-site enterprise network (c) do not represent multi-tenant datacenter applications, as they involve dedicated rather than shared infrastructure.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy', 'https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/', 'https://www.citrix.com/glossary/what-is-multi-tenancy.html']",1,8_data_center_virtualization,0.95,1

d. SDN makes some aspects of network virtualization easier to manage
e. Network virtualization enables SDN
",,"a,d","a,d",,"SDN controllers can manage various aspects of the data center beyond just network configuration, including storage and data facilities (a). While network virtualization and SDN are related concepts, network virtualization does not require SDN (c) and existed before SDN (b). However, SDN can make certain aspects of managing a virtualized network easier (d), such as through centralized control and programmability.
