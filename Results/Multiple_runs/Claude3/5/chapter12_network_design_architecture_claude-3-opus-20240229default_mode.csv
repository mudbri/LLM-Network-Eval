204,"The customer edge device is typically a router, that sits at a customer site on MPLS networks and connects to a provider edge router (PE router) to take communications from a customer site to a provider side.","a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",,a,a,,"The statement is true. In MPLS networks, the customer edge (CE) device, which is typically a router, is located at the customer's premises. The CE router connects to the provider edge (PE) router, which is the entry point into the service provider's MPLS network. The CE router is responsible for forwarding customer traffic to the PE router, which then uses MPLS labels to transport the traffic across the provider's network to the destination.","['MPLS Fundamentals by Luc De Ghein, Cisco Press', 'RFC 4364 - BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)', 'Cisco Documentation: MPLS VPN-BGP Local Convergence']",1,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,1
205,____________________ is a network design that connects a link between each pair of nodes.,"a. Full Mesh
b. Star
c. Hybrid
d. Partial Mesh
",,a,a,,"A full mesh topology is a network design where there is a direct link between each pair of nodes in the network. In a full mesh topology with n nodes, there are n(n-1)/2 links. This provides high redundancy and fault tolerance, as there are multiple paths between any two nodes. However, it can be expensive and complex to implement, especially as the number of nodes increases.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1 by Wendell Odom (Chapter 3: Fundamentals of LANs)', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/lan-switching/ethernet/10561-full-mesh-topology.html']",1,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,1

211,Your company plans to start using public cloud service and now you are considering different WAN options. Your main concern is security by keeping the data private while also providing good QoS services. Which of the following options are under consideration? (Choose two answers.),"a. Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider
b. Using an Internet connection without VPN
c. Using an Internet connection with VPN
d. Using an intercloud exchange
",,"a,d","a,c",,"When connecting to public cloud services, security and privacy of data are key considerations. Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider (a) ensures data remains on a private network without traversing the public Internet. Using an Internet connection with VPN (c) encrypts the data, keeping it private even when using public Internet links. Both these options provide security while enabling QoS controls. Using the Internet without VPN (b) exposes data and lacks QoS, while an intercloud exchange (d) connects different cloud providers but doesn't directly address WAN connectivity from the company to the cloud.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Wendell Odom, Chapter 14: WAN Architecture', 'Cloud Connect and Cloud Exchange Explained, Aryaka, https://www.aryaka.com/blog/cloud-connect-and-cloud-exchange-explained/', 'What is a Cloud VPN? | Virtual Private Network, Cisco, https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/vpn-endpoint-security-clients/what-is-vpn.html']",0,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,1

b. FALSE
",,b,b,,"The statement is false. In a public cloud solution, the cloud service provider is responsible for managing, maintaining, and updating the data centers. This is one of the key advantages of using public cloud services - the provider takes care of the underlying infrastructure, allowing the customer to focus on their applications and services. In contrast, with a private cloud (on-premise) solution, the organization is responsible for managing and maintaining their own data centers.","['https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/', 'https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-a-public-cloud/', 'https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/public-cloud']",1,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,1
