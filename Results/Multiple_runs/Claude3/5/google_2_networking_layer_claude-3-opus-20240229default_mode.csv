",,d,d,,CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing. It is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing Internet Protocol packets.

These are the two main types of Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) used for routing within an autonomous system.

Distance-Vector Protocols, like RIP, determine the best path based on a metric like hop count and exchange routing information with neighboring routers. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) are not types of IGPs; they are application layer and transport layer protocols, respectively.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross', 'CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1 by Wendell Odom']",1,google_2_networking_layer,0.95,1

d. Interior gateway protocols share information with multiple autonomous systems. Exterior Gateway Protocols are used for the exchange of information between independent autonomous systems.
",,b,b,,"Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) are used for exchanging routing information within a single autonomous system (AS).
