218,Which of the following configuration management tools uses agentless architecture for managing network devices?,"a. Ansible
b. Puppet
c. Chef
d. Ansible and Puppet
e. Puppet and Chef
",,a,a,,Ansible uses an agentless architecture for managing network devices. It connects to devices over SSH or API and does not require any agent software to be installed on the managed devices. Puppet and Chef both use an agent-based architecture where an agent program needs to be installed on each managed device to communicate with the central server.,"['Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Documentation: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.2/html/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_installation_guide/architecture-overview', 'Puppet Documentation: https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/architecture.html', 'Chef Documentation: https://docs.chef.io/architecture/']",1,chapter13_network_automation,0.95,1
