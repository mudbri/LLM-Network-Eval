",,a,a,,"A Layer 2 redirect or spoofing attack is commonly referred to as an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) attack. ARP is used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses on a local network segment. In an ARP spoofing attack, a malicious actor sends forged ARP messages over a local area network to associate their MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate device or server. This allows the attacker to intercept, modify or redirect network traffic intended for that IP address.","['NIST Special Publication 800-48 Revision 1: Guide to Securing Legacy IEEE 802.11 Wireless Networks', 'CCNA Cyber Ops SECOPS 210-255 Official Cert Guide by Omar Santos, Joseph Muniz', 'CompTIA Security+ SY0-601 Exam Cram by Diane Barrett']",1,NetSec,0.95,1
35,Which one of the following options is the illegitimate DHCP server that is referred to in the context of a DHCP server-based attack? Select one choice.,"a. A sitting duck server
b. A rogue DHCP server
c. A target server
d. An erroneous server
",,b,b,,"A rogue DHCP server is the illegitimate DHCP server referred to in the context of a DHCP server-based attack. A rogue DHCP server is set up by an attacker to issue malicious DHCP leases to clients, potentially redirecting their traffic or providing incorrect network configuration. The other options do not correctly describe an illegitimate DHCP server in this context.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1 by Wendell Odom (Chapter 7: Implementing DHCP)', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_DHCP']",1,NetSec,0.95,1
36,What is one way of mitigating DHCP attacks by using a Cisco switch? Select one choice.,"a. VLAN segmentation
b. MAC address security
c. DHCP snooping
d. DHCP authentication""
",,c,c,,"DHCP snooping is a Cisco switch feature that can help mitigate DHCP attacks. It works by acting as a firewall between untrusted hosts and the DHCP server. The switch builds and maintains a DHCP snooping binding table, which contains the MAC address, IP address, lease time, binding type, and VLAN number of each host. Incoming DHCP messages are filtered based on this table. Untrusted messages, such as those coming from an attacker, are dropped. This helps prevent DHCP spoofing and starvation attacks.","['Cisco Networking Academy, CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1, Chapter 9: DHCP Snooping', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750x_3560x/software/release/12-2_55_se/configuration/guide/3750xscg/swdhcp82.html']",1,NetSec,0.95,1
