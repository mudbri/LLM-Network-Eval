32,What are some of the reasons that it is difficult to deploy improvements to BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. Changes are necessarily incremental because of the large installed base of routers that already run BGP.
b. BGP is implemented in hardware, so deploying changes to BGP requires changes on the timescale of hardware development cycles.
c. Deplyoing changes to BGP requires coordination across potentially tens of thousands of ASes in the Internet.
d. Only a few vendors implement BGP, and deploying changes requires convincing those vendors to change the protocol.
e. Deploying changes requires coordination in standards bodies such as the IETF.
",,"a,c,e","a,c,e",,"Deploying improvements to BGP is difficult for several reasons. First, changes need to be incremental due to the large installed base of BGP routers already deployed, making drastic changes infeasible (a). Second, deploying BGP changes requires coordination across the many autonomous systems that make up the Internet, which could number in the tens of thousands (c). Finally, changes to BGP need to go through the standardization process in bodies like the IETF to ensure interoperability (e). BGP is typically implemented in software, not hardware (b), and there are multiple vendors that provide BGP implementations (d), so those are not major factors impeding BGP improvements.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross, Section 4.3', 'RFC 4271 - A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/press/internet-protocol-journal/back-issues/table-contents-35/bgp-deployments.html']",1,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.95,1

c. In an RCP deployment, routers no longer have to compute routes.
