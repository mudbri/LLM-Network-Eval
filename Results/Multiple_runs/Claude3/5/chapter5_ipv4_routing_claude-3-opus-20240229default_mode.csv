91,You have noticed that a server with IP 145.45.3.2 doesn’t respond to requests. What command will you type first in order to test connectivity between your device and the server?,"a. request 145.45.3.2
b. check 145.45.3.2
c. ping 145.45.3.2
d. ping 145.45.3.2
",,c,c,,The 'ping' command is the correct choice to test connectivity between your device and the server with IP address 145.45.3.2. Ping uses ICMP echo request and echo reply messages to determine if a host is reachable and responsive on an IP network. It provides basic information about latency and packet loss. The other options listed are not valid commands for testing network connectivity.,"['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1 by Wendell Odom (Cisco Press)', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ios-nx-os-software/ios-software-releases-121-mainline/12778-ping-traceroute.html']",1,chapter5_ipv4_routing,0.95,1
92,"A LAN design uses a Layer 3 EtherChannel between two switches SW1 and SW2, with port-channel interface 1 used on both switches. SW1 uses ports G0/1 and G0/2 in the channel. However, only interface G0/1 is bundled into the channel and working. Think about the configuration settings on port G0/2 that could have existed before adding G0/2 to the EtherChannel. Which answers identify a setting that could prevent IOS from adding G0/2 to the Layer 3 EtherChannel? (Choose two answers.)","a. A different STP cost (spanning-tree cost value)
b. A different access VLAN (switchport access vlan vlanid)
c. A different speed (speed value)
d. A default setting for switchport (switchport)
",,"c,d","b,d",,"A Layer 3 EtherChannel requires that all physical interfaces have matching Layer 3 settings. Having the 'switchport' command configured on G0/2 puts it in Layer 2 mode, making it incompatible with the Layer 3 EtherChannel. Similarly, if G0/2 is configured with a different access VLAN than G0/1, it will prevent the interface from being added to the EtherChannel.

The next week, the network engineer receives a call that those same users can no longer ping each other. If the problem is with the Layer 3 switching function, which of the following could have caused the problem? (Choose two answers.)","a. A shutdown command issued from VLAN 4 configuration mode
b. VTP on the switch removing VLAN 5 from the switch’s VLAN list
c. 1 out of 10 working VLAN 4 access ports failing due to physical problems
d. A shutdown command issued from VLAN 6 configuration mode
",,"a,b","a,b",,"The most likely causes of the Layer 3 switching problem between VLANs 4 and 5 are:a) If the 'shutdown' command was issued in VLAN 4 configuration mode, it would administratively disable the SVI for VLAN 4, preventing inter-VLAN routing for that VLAN.  b) If VTP removed VLAN 5 from the switch's VLAN list, the SVI for VLAN 5 would be removed, breaking the Layer 3 connectivity between the VLANs.Choice c is incorrect because a single access port failure would only impact the host connected to that port, not routing between the VLANs.
