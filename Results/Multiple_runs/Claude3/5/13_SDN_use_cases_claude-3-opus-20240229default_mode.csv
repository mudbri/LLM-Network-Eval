95,What are some benefits to using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Host configuration is simpler, since all hosts are visible from a single large Ethernet topology.
b. Forwarding on physical MAC addresses is simpler, since both the data center network topology and hosts' physical MAC addresses are hierarchical.
c. IP routing does not need to be reconfigured when physical or virtual machines move from one part of the network to another.
d. Scaling problems are simpler, since all hosts are configured on a single, flat topology.
e. Load balancing is easier on a layer-2 topology than on a layer 3 topology.
",,"a,c","a,c",,"Using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center provides benefits in terms of simplified host configuration and IP routing. With all hosts visible on a single large Ethernet topology, configuration is simpler since there is no need to deal with multiple IP subnets. Additionally, when physical or virtual machines move within the data center network, their IP addresses remain the same, avoiding the need to reconfigure IP routing. However, forwarding based on physical MAC addresses is not necessarily simpler in a large flat topology compared to a hierarchical one. Scaling can also be more challenging with a single large broadcast domain. Load balancing depends more on the specific mechanisms used rather than the layer-2 vs layer-3 topology.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-7000-series-switches/white_paper_c11-522337.html', 'https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/concept/layer-2-understanding.html']",1,13_SDN_use_cases,0.8,1
96,"In PortLand, what are the reasons for assigning hosts pseudo-MAC addresses, as opposed to simply forwarding traffic on physical MAC addresses? Select all that apply.","a. Hosts in the data-center network topology are more vulnerable to attack if they expose their actual physical MAC addresses, rather than having a layer of indirection.
b. It is very difficult to load balance traffic using physical MAC addresses; pseudo MAC addresses make it possible to assign traffic to destination IP addresses.
c. Without pseudo-MAC addresses, switches would have to update forwarding state whenever hosts with a particular MAC address moved from one portion of the topology to another.
d. Forwarding loops are be more common in a flat layer-2 topology than they are in a topology with hierarchical pseudo MAC addresses.
e. In a flat layer-2 topology, switches cannot know on which port to forward traffic without maintaining switch tables for each MAC address, since MAC addresses are flat, not hierarchical.
",,"c,e","c,e",,"Pseudo-MAC addresses are used in PortLand for two main reasons:1) Without pseudo-MAC addresses that encode location information, switches would need to update forwarding state whenever a host moves in the network topology, since the switch port associated with that host's MAC address would change. Pseudo-MAC addresses avoid this issue by encoding switch and port information hierarchically.2) In a flat layer-2 topology using physical MAC addresses, switches cannot determine the appropriate output port for a destination MAC address just by looking at the address, since MAC addresses are flat. They would need to maintain a large table mapping every MAC address to a port. Pseudo-MAC addresses solve this by encoding the switch and port hierarchically in the MAC address itself.","[""R.

97,What are the steps involved in the Proxy ARP process that PortLand's Fabric Manager runs?,"a. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns returns PMAC directly to the end host.
b. Edge switch sends ARP query to fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch updates its local PMAC mapping table.
c. Host sends ARP query, fabric manager intercepts ARP query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to end host.
d. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to the host.

",,e,e,,"In PortLand's Proxy ARP process, the host first sends an ARP query. The edge switch intercepts this query and redirects it to the fabric manager. The fabric manager then consults its PMAC mapping table to determine the PMAC corresponding to the requested IP address. It returns this PMAC to the edge switch. Finally, the edge switch returns the PMAC to the end host that originated the ARP query.","['PortLand: A Scalable Fault-Tolerant Layer 2 Data Center Network Fabric, Mysore et al., SIGCOMM 2009', 'https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs5413/2014fa/lectures/21-portland.pdf']",1,13_SDN_use_cases,0.95,1
98,"What are some of the disadvantages of today's interdomain routing protocol, BGP? Select all that apply.","a. ISPs cannot load-balance traffic across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix.
b. Routing and forwarding decisions are only based on IP prefix, not on a broader range of traffic flow attributes.
c. ISPs can only influence route selection through indirect mechanisms (e.g., prepending), rather than directly manipulating the forwarding table entries in switches.

",,c,c,,The correct answer is c because it accurately represents the desired policy using the given syntax. The policy consists of two independent parts combined with the '+' operator. The first part matches traffic from the child's computer to Facebook IP addresses and drops it. The second part matches BitTorrent traffic from the child's computer and applies rate limiting based on the dynamic 'limitIfVOIP' policy. The '>>' operator is used to chain the match and action for each part. Options a and d incorrectly use the '+' operator to combine the match and action within each part.
