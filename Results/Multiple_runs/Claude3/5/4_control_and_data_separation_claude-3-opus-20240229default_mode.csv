23,Which of the following are examples of control plane operations? Select all that apply.,"a. Rate-limiting traffic so that the overall sending rate does not exceed a certain throughput.
b. Determining that a user's MAC address is authentic before allowing it to send traffic on the network.
c. Load balancing traffic across two output ports based on the hash of each packet's source IP address.
d. Determining the forwarding path that satisfies an access control policy.
e. Computing a shortest path routing tree.
",,"b,d,e","d,e",,"Control plane operations involve making decisions about how data traffic should be handled, rather than the actual forwarding of packets.

The other options involve data plane operations - rate limiting (a), MAC authentication (b), and load balancing (c) all manipulate or filter the data packets themselves.","['Software Defined Networks: A Comprehensive Approach, Second Edition by Paul Goransson, Chuck Black', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/inside-sdn-architecture/', 'https://www.networkcomputing.com/networking/understanding-sdn-control-plane']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.95,1
25,What could be the operational steps behind the AT&T's IRSCP (a commercial version of the Routing Control Platform) for detecting malicious traffic? Select all that apply.,"a. The controller sees all traffic passing through the network, detects an attack, and installs a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where the attack traffic is originating.
b. The end host changes its IP address so that it is no longer the target of the attack traffic.
c. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to re-route traffic through a deep-packet inspection device.
d. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to install a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where attack traffic is originating.
e. A victim end host sends an alert to an on-path firewall about the source and nature of an attack, at which point the firewall installs a null route to drop the traffic at the entry point where the attack is originating.
",,"c,d","c,d",,"The correct steps for AT&T's IRSCP in detecting and mitigating malicious traffic are: c) A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point, and instructs the controller to re-route the traffic through a deep-packet inspection device for further analysis.d) A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point, and instructs the controller to install a null route to drop the malicious traffic at the entry point.The controller itself does not see all the traffic to detect attacks (a).

26,What are some example network management applications that become easier with control and data plane separation? Select all that apply.,"a. Improved interdomain routing security.
b. Customer-controlled egress selection.
c. Improved logging capabilities.
d. Planned maintenance of an edge router.
e. Forecasting of network capacity.
",,"a,b,d","b,d",,"With the separation of control and data planes in SDN, certain network management tasks become easier. Customer-controlled egress selection (b) is simplified because the control plane has a global network view and can intelligently select egress points based on customer preferences. Planned maintenance of an edge router (d) is also easier because traffic can be rerouted by the control plane to avoid the router being serviced, minimizing disruption. While SDN may provide some security and logging benefits, interdomain routing security (a) and logging capabilities (c) are not the key advantages of control/data plane separation. Forecasting network capacity (e) is also not directly simplified by this separation.","['Software Defined Networks: A Comprehensive Approach by Paul Goransson and Chuck Black, Chapter 4: SDN Architecture and Protocols', 'https://www.networkworld.com/article/3209131/what-sdn-is-and-where-its-going.html']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.85,1
27,What are some of the motivations for using Layer-2 forwarding in a data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Ability to use existing routing protocols to establish paths between hosts.

28,How does the separation of the control and data plane make networking in data centers easier?,"a. Virtual machines can be migrated within the network without renumbering entire portions of the network or re-assigning network services to different IP addresses.
b. The control plane allows traffic to be forwarded using Layer 2 addresses, thus allowing automatic load balance across the topology.
c. The separation allows fewer switches to be used in the data center topology, thus lowering costs.
d. All routes can be controlled and monitored from a central point of control.
e. A network controller can permit the renumbering of end hosts to have topology-dependent Layer 2 MAC addresses.

e. Forwarding loops.
",,"c,e","b,c,d,e",,"Consistency problems between multiple controller replicas in the control plane of a software-defined network can lead to several issues:b.

Incorrect operation when one controller fails - If a controller fails, inconsistencies with remaining controllers can cause the network to operate incorrectly.e.

d. Using different controllers for independent parts of the network.
e. Having multiple controllers install forwarding table entries on the same router and resolving the conflict on the router itself.

32,"Which property guarantees that each RCP replica continues to install correct forwarding state in the network data plane, even in the case of a partition in the data plane?","a. Each controller has a complete view of the portion of the network that it is controlling, and therefore can guarantee consistent routing within that partition.
b. The controller cannot see many of the routers in the network anyway, so there is no way for it to install incorrect routing state in the routers that it is not connected to.
c. The controllers are partitioned from the network routers, and the routers will fall back to running a distributed routing protocol.
d. Running the network from a single high-level control plane guarantees that network partitions and loops never occur in the first place.
