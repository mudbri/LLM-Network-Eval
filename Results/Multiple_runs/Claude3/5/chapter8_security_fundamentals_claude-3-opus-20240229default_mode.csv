137,"In a spoofing attack, which of the following parameters are commonly spoofed? (Choose two answers)","a. Source IP address
b. MAC address
c. ARP address
d. Routing table
e. Destination IP address
f. ARP table
",,"a,b","a,b",,"In a spoofing attack, the two most commonly spoofed parameters are:a. Source IP address: Attackers can forge the source IP address in the packet header to make it appear as if the packets are coming from a trusted or legitimate source. This is known as IP spoofing.b. MAC address: Attackers can change the MAC address of their device to impersonate another device on the network. This is called MAC spoofing.The other choices, such as ARP address, routing table, destination IP address, and ARP table, are not typically spoofed in a spoofing attack.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Wendell Odom, Cisco Press, 2020', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/what-is-spoofing.html']",1,chapter8_security_fundamentals,0.95,1
