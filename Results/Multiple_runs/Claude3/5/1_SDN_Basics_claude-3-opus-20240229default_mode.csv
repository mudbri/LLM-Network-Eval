1,Which of the following are true about Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)? Select all that apply.,"a. The only sizes for an IP address allocation before CIDR were 8, 16, or 24 bits.
b. The prefix length for a CIDR prefix can be anywhere in the range from 0 to 32 bits.
c. In an Internet forwarding table with CIDR, there can only be one unique matching entry for any given IP address.
d. CIDR slowed the rate of Internet routing table growth because prefixes no longer had to be allocated in fixed-size blocks.
",,"b,d","b,d",,"CIDR allows for variable-length subnet masking, where the prefix length can be anywhere from 0 to 32 bits, enabling more efficient allocation of IP address blocks compared to the fixed sizes of 8, 16, or 24 bits used before CIDR. This flexibility in prefix sizes helped slow the growth of Internet routing tables. However, with CIDR, there can be multiple matching entries in the forwarding table for a given IP address, with the longest prefix match being used.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
2,Which of the following are true about how DNS lookups work? Select all that apply.,"a. A DNS A-record query for google.com will only return a single IP address at a time.
b. An NS-record query for a DNS lookup will return the name(s) of the authoritative name server(s) for that domain.
c. If your local DNS resolver caches an NS record for google.com for multiple days, all clients who use that DNS resolver will continue using the same IP address to reach Google’s Web server until that NS record expires.
d. An MX-record query for a DNS lookup will return the IP address of the mail server for that domain.
e. All DNS PTR records are maintained by a single organization in-addr.arpa.
",,b,b,,"An NS (Name Server) record query returns the authoritative name server(s) for the specified domain. The other options are incorrect: a) An A record can return multiple IP addresses, not just one at a time.   c) NS records map domain names to authoritative name servers, not IP addresses of web servers. Even if an NS record is cached, the IP address of the web server can change. d) MX records specify the mail server hostname, not its IP address.  e) PTR records map IP addresses to domain names and are maintained by the owner of the IP address block, not a single central organization.","['DNS and BIND, 5th Edition by Cricket Liu, Paul Albitz', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
3,Which of the following are true about traffic control with BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
b. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
c. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
d. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
",,"a,b","a,c",,"A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control outbound traffic from their AS to a destination. The local preference is used to prefer certain paths out of the AS over others. BGP AS path prepending can also be used to control outbound traffic by making certain paths appear longer and thus less preferred. However, AS path prepending is typically used to influence inbound traffic by making paths through the operator's AS look less attractive to other ASes. The local preference attribute has no impact on inbound traffic since it is not shared with external BGP peers.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/13753-25.html', 'https://www.noction.com/blog/bgp-path-prepending', 'Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
4,Which of the following are true about layering? Select all that apply.,"a. The network layer guarantees reliable, in-order delivery of packets.
b. The network layer has only a single protocol in widespread use today, representing what we call the “narrow waist”.
c. The transport layer uses port numbers.
d. The destination address in the link layer header is always the address of the next layer-3 node along an end-to-end IP path.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"Option b is correct because the network layer, with IP as its narrow waist, has only a single protocol in widespread use today. Option c is also correct as the transport layer protocols like TCP and UDP use port numbers to multiplex/demultiplex data to/from applications. Option a is incorrect because reliable, in-order delivery is typically the responsibility of the transport layer (e.g., TCP), not the network layer. Option d is incorrect because the link layer destination address is the address of the next layer-2 node (hop), not necessarily the next layer-3 node along an end-to-end path.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross', 'TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols by W.

5,Which of the following are not true about packet switching? Select all that apply.,"a. Once a connection is established between two endpoints in a packet switched network, the end-to-end route cannot change, or the connection must be re-established.
b. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will always experience predictable latency.
c. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will never be dropped by intermediate nodes along the path.
d. A user of a packet switched network might occasionally get a “busy signal” if there are too many users on the network.
",,"a,b,c,d","a,b,c,d",,"None of the statements about packet switching are true:a) In a packet switched network, packets can take different routes between endpoints without needing to re-establish the connection. b) Latency in packet switched networks is variable and depends on factors like network congestion and the route taken by packets.c) Packets can be dropped by intermediate nodes if buffers are full or errors occur.d) Packet switched networks do not have the concept of a ""busy signal"". If the network is congested, packets may be delayed or dropped but connections are not blocked.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching', 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/packet-switching-and-delays-in-computer-network/', 'Kurose, James F., and Keith W.

6,Which of the following are true about content distribution networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Content distribution networks can improve the performance that a client sees by reducing the network latency between the client and the content that it is downloading.
b. Content distribution networks can reduce transit expenses for a content provider by enabling much of the provider’s content to be served from a nearby network, sometimes even from a cache that is within the client’s own network.
c. Real-time content such as video streams cannot be distributed from a content distribution network.
d. Content distribution networks typically redirect Web clients to a nearby Web cache by rewriting the IP address of packets sent from the client to the IP address of the nearby Web cache.
",,"a,b","a,b",,"Content distribution networks (CDNs) can improve client performance by reducing network latency, as the content is served from a nearby cache rather than the origin server which may be geographically distant (a). CDNs can also reduce transit costs for the content provider, as much of the content is served from caches within the client's network or nearby, reducing the provider's outbound bandwidth usage (b). However, CDNs are capable of distributing real-time content like video streams (c is incorrect). Redirection to a nearby cache is typically done by DNS resolution of the content URL to the IP address of the optimal cache, not by rewriting packet IP addresses (d is incorrect).","['Content Delivery Networks: Fundamentals, Design, and Evolution.

7,Which of the following are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control? Select all that apply.,"a. Only wireless networks can have collisions at the receiver; such collisions are not possible on wired Ethernet networks.
b. Using RTS/CTS (“request to send”, “clear to send”) control reduces the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network.
c. A wireless sender can avoid causing a collision at the receiver by performing a “carrier sense” to determine whether any other sender wants to transmit at the time that it wishes to send a packet.
d. Disabling RTS/CTS necessarily lowers the effective throughput of the wireless network, since more collisions will occur at the receiver without RTS/CTS enabled.
",,b,"b,c",,"Both options b and c are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control. Using RTS/CTS does reduce overall throughput because of the additional control overhead, but it helps avoid collisions especially for larger packets (b). Wireless senders can perform carrier sensing to check if the medium is free before transmitting to avoid collisions (c). Option a is false because collisions can occur on wired Ethernet as well. Option d is false because disabling RTS/CTS does not necessarily lower throughput, as it depends on factors like network load and packet sizes.","['802.11 Wireless Networks: The Definitive Guide, 2nd Edition by Matthew Gast', 'Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11_RTS/CTS']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,1
8,Which of the following are true about video streaming? Select all that apply.,"a. Using UDP to stream a video instead of TCP is appropriate if the client is more concerned about low delay and interactivity than it does about receiving a high-quality stream.
b. A larger playout buffer at the client allows the client more time to recover from lost packets.
c. Using TCP for video streaming could result in larger delays between transmission and playout than streaming the same video with UDP.
d. Since UDP provides no reliable delivery guarantees, a video streaming application that uses UDP as its transport cannot recover from any packet loss in the video stream.
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"Using UDP for video streaming is appropriate when the client prioritizes low delay and interactivity over receiving a high-quality stream (a). A larger playout buffer at the client allows more time to recover from lost packets by smoothing out jitter and reordering packets (b). TCP's reliable delivery and congestion control mechanisms can introduce larger delays compared to UDP when streaming the same video (c). However, (d) is incorrect because even though UDP itself does not provide reliable delivery, the application layer can implement error recovery techniques to handle packet loss, such as forward error correction or retransmission requests.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross, Section 7.4', 'https://www.networkworld.com/article/3254575/why-tcp-and-udp-play-a-big-role-in-video-conferencing.html']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
9,Which of the following are true about TCP? Select all that apply.,"a. TCP guarantees that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted.
b. A TCP sender and receiver use a “three-way handshake” both to set up and to terminate the TCP connection.
c. TCP’s congestion avoidance algorithm causes the sender to reduce its sending rate by a factor of two when it sees a packet loss.
d. A TCP sender controls its sending rate by adjusting the number of unacknowledged packets that can be sent over the network at any time.
",,"a,c,d","a,d",,"TCP guarantees reliable, in-order delivery of a stream of bytes from sender to receiver (a). TCP uses a sliding window protocol where the sender controls its transmission rate by adjusting the number of unacknowledged packets that can be in transit at any given time (d). While TCP does use a three-way handshake to establish a connection, it uses a four-way handshake to terminate the connection (b is incorrect). TCP's congestion control algorithm typically halves the congestion window upon packet loss, but the actual rate reduction depends on other factors like the slow start threshold (c is not always true).","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach (7th Edition) by Kurose and Ross, Section 3.5', 'TCP congestion control: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control', 'Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc793.txt']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
10,Which of the following are true about denial of service attacks (and defenses)? Select all that apply.,"a. If every network on the Internet performed stateless ingress filtering to defend against source IP spoofing, the DNS reflection attack would not work.
b. If every network on the Internet performed stateless egress filtering to defend against source IP address spoofing, the DNS reflection attack could not be carried out.
c. In a “SYN Flood” attack, each TCP SYN packet that a victim receives causes it to set up TCP connection state.
d. A “DNS Reflection” attack requires the attacking client to “spoof” the source IP address of the packet containing the DNS request.
",,"b,c,d","b,c,d",,"Options b, c, and d are all correct regarding denial of service attacks and defenses:b) If every network performed egress filtering to prevent source IP spoofing, attackers could not spoof the victim's IP as the source of DNS requests in a reflection attack.  c) In a SYN flood, each received SYN causes the victim to allocate resources for a half-open TCP connection, potentially exhausting resources.d) DNS reflection attacks require the attacker to spoof the victim's IP as the source of DNS requests, so the DNS responses flood the victim.Option a is incorrect because ingress filtering at the destination cannot prevent spoofed source IPs used in a reflection attack.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Reflected_attack']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
