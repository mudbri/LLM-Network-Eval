90,The protocol used to communicate network errors is known as __________.,"a. ICMP
b. Traceroute
c. TCP
d. UDP
",,a,a,,"ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is used to communicate network errors and operational information. It is used by network devices like routers to send error messages and operational information indicating success or failure when communicating with another IP address. ICMP is not used to exchange data between systems, but for reporting issues and checking connectivity.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1 by Wendell Odom (Cisco Press)', 'Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach by James Kurose and Keith Ross (Pearson)', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol']",1,google_6_troubleshooting_and_future_networking,0.95,1
91,The ping utility sends what message type?,"a. Echo Request
b. Echo Reply
c. Destination Network Unknown
d. Destination Network Unreachable
",,a,a,,"The ping utility sends ICMP Echo Request messages to a specified host to test network connectivity. If the destination host receives the Echo Request and is able to communicate back, it responds with an ICMP Echo Reply message. This allows ping to determine the round-trip time and packet loss to assess the reachability of the host and performance of the network path.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1, Chapter 16: IP Services, by Wendell Odom', 'RFC 792 - Internet Control Message Protocol, September 1981']",1,google_6_troubleshooting_and_future_networking,0.95,1

b. Ping
c. Test-NetConnection
d. Tracert
",,c,c,,"Test-NetConnection is a PowerShell cmdlet in Windows that can be used to test TCP connectivity to a remote host and port. It can verify if a specific port is reachable on a target system. Ping only tests ICMP connectivity, tracert traces the route to a host, and netcat is not a built-in Windows tool.","['https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/nettcpip/test-netconnection', 'https://adamtheautomator.com/test-netconnection/']",1,google_6_troubleshooting_and_future_networking,0.95,1

94,"During a traceroute, which action does a router perform to the value in the Time To Live (TTL) field?","a. Multiplication
b. Division
c. Subtraction
d. Addition
",,c,c,,"During a traceroute, each router that receives the packet subtracts one from the Time To Live (TTL) value before forwarding the packet to the next hop. When a router receives a packet with a TTL value of 1, it discards the packet and sends an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the source, indicating that the packet's TTL has expired. This process allows traceroute to map the path a packet takes from the source to the destination by incrementing the initial TTL value by one for each successive packet sent.","['Kurose, J.
