1,Which of the following are true about Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)? Select all that apply.,"a. The only sizes for an IP address allocation before CIDR were 8, 16, or 24 bits.
b. The prefix length for a CIDR prefix can be anywhere in the range from 0 to 32 bits.
c. In an Internet forwarding table with CIDR, there can only be one unique matching entry for any given IP address.
d. CIDR slowed the rate of Internet routing table growth because prefixes no longer had to be allocated in fixed-size blocks.
",,"b,d","b,d",,"CIDR allows for variable-length subnet masks, with prefix lengths ranging from 0 to 32 bits. This enables more efficient allocation of IP addresses compared to the fixed block sizes used before CIDR. By allowing prefixes to be allocated in variable-sized blocks, CIDR helped slow the growth rate of Internet routing tables. However, there can be multiple matching entries in a forwarding table for a given IP address with CIDR, with the longest prefix match being used.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
2,Which of the following are true about how DNS lookups work? Select all that apply.,"a. A DNS A-record query for google.com will only return a single IP address at a time.
b. An NS-record query for a DNS lookup will return the name(s) of the authoritative name server(s) for that domain.
c. If your local DNS resolver caches an NS record for google.com for multiple days, all clients who use that DNS resolver will continue using the same IP address to reach Google’s Web server until that NS record expires.
d. An MX-record query for a DNS lookup will return the IP address of the mail server for that domain.
e. All DNS PTR records are maintained by a single organization in-addr.arpa.
",,b,b,,"An NS (Name Server) record query returns the authoritative name server(s) for the queried domain. The other options are incorrect: a) An A record can return multiple IP addresses, not just one at a time. c) NS records map domain names to authoritative name servers, not IP addresses of web servers. Even if an NS record is cached, the IP address can still change. d) MX records return the hostname of the mail server(s), not the IP address directly.  e) PTR records are delegated and maintained by the owner of the IP address block, not a single central organization.","['DNS and BIND, 5th Edition by Cricket Liu, Paul Albitz', 'RFC 1035 - Domain Names - Implementation and Specification', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
3,Which of the following are true about traffic control with BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
b. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
c. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
d. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
",,"a,b","a,c",,"A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control outbound traffic from their AS to a destination. The local preference is used to prefer certain paths out of the AS over others. BGP AS path prepending can also be used to control outbound traffic by making certain paths appear longer and less preferred to other ASes, causing them to prefer alternate paths. However, the local preference attribute cannot directly control inbound traffic to the AS, and AS path prepending does not control inbound traffic from the operator's own AS to a destination.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross', 'BGP: Building Reliable Networks with the Border Gateway Protocol by Iljitsch van Beijnum']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
4,Which of the following are true about layering? Select all that apply.,"a. The network layer guarantees reliable, in-order delivery of packets.
b. The network layer has only a single protocol in widespread use today, representing what we call the “narrow waist”.
c. The transport layer uses port numbers.
d. The destination address in the link layer header is always the address of the next layer-3 node along an end-to-end IP path.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"The network layer does not guarantee reliable, in-order delivery of packets (choice a is incorrect). That is the responsibility of the transport layer if using TCP. The network layer, represented by IP (Internet Protocol), is considered the 'narrow waist' as it is the single protocol that higher level protocols build upon (choice b is correct). The transport layer uses port numbers to multiplex/demultiplex data to/from the correct application (choice c is correct). The link layer destination address is the address of the next layer-2 node, not necessarily the next layer-3 node, along the path to the destination (choice d is incorrect).","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross, Chapters 1.5 and 5.4', 'TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols by W.

5,Which of the following are not true about packet switching? Select all that apply.,"a. Once a connection is established between two endpoints in a packet switched network, the end-to-end route cannot change, or the connection must be re-established.
b. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will always experience predictable latency.
c. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will never be dropped by intermediate nodes along the path.
d. A user of a packet switched network might occasionally get a “busy signal” if there are too many users on the network.
",,"a,b,c,d","a,b,c,d",,"All of the given choices are not true about packet switching: a) In a packet switched network, the route between endpoints can change dynamically without needing to re-establish the connection. b) Latency in a packet switched network is not predictable as it depends on factors like network congestion and the chosen route. c) Packets can be dropped by intermediate nodes in a packet switched network if buffers are full or errors occur. d) Packet switched networks do not have the concept of a ""busy signal"" like circuit switched networks. If the network is congested, packets may be delayed or dropped but users will not receive a busy signal.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
6,Which of the following are true about content distribution networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Content distribution networks can improve the performance that a client sees by reducing the network latency between the client and the content that it is downloading.
b. Content distribution networks can reduce transit expenses for a content provider by enabling much of the provider’s content to be served from a nearby network, sometimes even from a cache that is within the client’s own network.
c. Real-time content such as video streams cannot be distributed from a content distribution network.
d. Content distribution networks typically redirect Web clients to a nearby Web cache by rewriting the IP address of packets sent from the client to the IP address of the nearby Web cache.
",,"a,b","a,b",,"Content distribution networks (CDNs) can improve performance for clients by reducing network latency, as the content is served from a nearby cache rather than the origin server which may be farther away (a). CDNs can also reduce transit costs for content providers by serving content from caches closer to the client, even within the client's own network, thus reducing the amount of data that needs to transit through the provider's network (b). However, CDNs are capable of distributing real-time content like video streams (c is incorrect). Lastly, CDNs typically redirect clients to nearby caches by rewriting URLs or DNS entries, not by rewriting IP addresses in packets (d is incorrect).","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross, Section 2.4', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/', 'https://www.akamai.com/our-thinking/cdn/what-is-a-cdn']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
7,Which of the following are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control? Select all that apply.,"a. Only wireless networks can have collisions at the receiver; such collisions are not possible on wired Ethernet networks.
b. Using RTS/CTS (“request to send”, “clear to send”) control reduces the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network.
c. A wireless sender can avoid causing a collision at the receiver by performing a “carrier sense” to determine whether any other sender wants to transmit at the time that it wishes to send a packet.
d. Disabling RTS/CTS necessarily lowers the effective throughput of the wireless network, since more collisions will occur at the receiver without RTS/CTS enabled.
",,b,"b,c",,"Both options b and c are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control. Using RTS/CTS control frames introduces additional overhead which reduces the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network (b). A wireless sender can avoid causing collisions at the receiver by performing carrier sensing to determine if the medium is free before transmitting (c). Option a is false because collisions can occur on wired Ethernet networks as well. Option d is false because disabling RTS/CTS does not necessarily lower throughput, as it depends on factors like network load and collision probability.","['802.11 Wireless Networks: The Definitive Guide, 2nd Edition by Matthew Gast', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11_RTS/CTS', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless-mobility/80211/213737-802-11-frames-a-starter-guide-to-learn-w.html']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
8,Which of the following are true about video streaming? Select all that apply.,"a. Using UDP to stream a video instead of TCP is appropriate if the client is more concerned about low delay and interactivity than it does about receiving a high-quality stream.
b. A larger playout buffer at the client allows the client more time to recover from lost packets.
c. Using TCP for video streaming could result in larger delays between transmission and playout than streaming the same video with UDP.
d. Since UDP provides no reliable delivery guarantees, a video streaming application that uses UDP as its transport cannot recover from any packet loss in the video stream.
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"Using UDP for video streaming is appropriate when low delay and interactivity are prioritized over high quality, since UDP does not retransmit lost packets (a). A larger playout buffer gives the client more time to recover from packet loss by allowing delayed packets to still arrive in time for playout (b). TCP's reliable delivery can introduce larger delays compared to UDP due to retransmissions and congestion control (c). However, (d) is incorrect because UDP-based streaming applications can employ error recovery techniques like FEC or selective retransmission to handle some packet loss.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross, Section 7.3', 'https://www.bogotobogo.com/VideoStreaming/images/VideoStreaming_Protocols.png']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
9,Which of the following are true about TCP? Select all that apply.,"a. TCP guarantees that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted.
b. A TCP sender and receiver use a “three-way handshake” both to set up and to terminate the TCP connection.
c. TCP’s congestion avoidance algorithm causes the sender to reduce its sending rate by a factor of two when it sees a packet loss.
d. A TCP sender controls its sending rate by adjusting the number of unacknowledged packets that can be sent over the network at any time.
",,"a,c,d","a,d",,"TCP guarantees reliable, in-order delivery of a stream of bytes from sender to receiver (a). TCP also uses a sliding window protocol where the sender adjusts its sending rate based on the number of unacknowledged packets in flight (d). While TCP does use a three-way handshake to establish a connection, it uses a four-way handshake to terminate the connection (b is incorrect). TCP's congestion control algorithm reduces the sending rate by half when it detects a packet loss, not by a factor of two (c is incorrect).","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach (7th Edition) by Kurose and Ross', 'TCP congestion control: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
10,Which of the following are true about denial of service attacks (and defenses)? Select all that apply.,"a. If every network on the Internet performed stateless ingress filtering to defend against source IP spoofing, the DNS reflection attack would not work.
b. If every network on the Internet performed stateless egress filtering to defend against source IP address spoofing, the DNS reflection attack could not be carried out.
c. In a “SYN Flood” attack, each TCP SYN packet that a victim receives causes it to set up TCP connection state.
d. A “DNS Reflection” attack requires the attacking client to “spoof” the source IP address of the packet containing the DNS request.
",,"b,c,d","b,c,d",,"Options b, c, and d are correct about denial of service attacks and defenses:  b) If every network performed egress filtering to prevent source IP spoofing, attackers would not be able to spoof the victim's IP as the source in the DNS requests, so the reflection attack would fail.  c) In a SYN flood, each spoofed SYN causes the victim to allocate resources for a half-open TCP connection. This can exhaust the victim's resources if done at scale.  d) DNS reflection requires the attacker to spoof the victim's IP as the source of DNS requests. The DNS servers then send their (larger) responses to the victim, amplifying the attack traffic.  Option a is incorrect because ingress filtering at the DNS servers would not stop them from responding to spoofed requests, it would just drop the responses later.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/dns-amplification-ddos-attack/', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/syn-flood-ddos-attack/']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1
