25,What could be the operational steps behind the AT&T's IRSCP (a commercial version of the Routing Control Platform) for detecting malicious traffic? Select all that apply.,"a. The controller sees all traffic passing through the network, detects an attack, and installs a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where the attack traffic is originating.
b. The end host changes its IP address so that it is no longer the target of the attack traffic.
c. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to re-route traffic through a deep-packet inspection device.
d. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to install a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where attack traffic is originating.
e. A victim end host sends an alert to an on-path firewall about the source and nature of an attack, at which point the firewall installs a null route to drop the traffic at the entry point where the attack is originating.
",,"c,d","c,d",,"The correct operational steps for AT&T's IRSCP in detecting malicious traffic are:c) A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to re-route traffic through a deep-packet inspection device.

This prevents the malicious traffic from entering the network.The other options are incorrect because:a) The controller does not see all traffic passing through the network. It relies on the measurement system to detect attacks.b) Changing the end host's IP address does not stop the attack at the entry point.e) The victim end host does not send an alert directly to an on-path firewall.

Planned maintenance of an edge router: With a centralized control plane, traffic can be easily rerouted when an edge router needs to undergo planned maintenance.

Each controller has a complete view of the portion of the network that it is controlling, and therefore can guarantee consistent routing within that partition.
b. The controller cannot see many of the routers in the network anyway, so there is no way for it to install incorrect routing state in the routers that it is not connected to.
