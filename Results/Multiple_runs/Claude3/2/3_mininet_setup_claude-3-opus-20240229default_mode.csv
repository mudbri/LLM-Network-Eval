16,Which of the following command is used to generate an OpenFlow network topology consisting of a single switch and 8 hosts with randomly generated MAC addresses for each host?,"a. sudo mn --topo single,8  --switch ovsk --controller remote
b. sudo mn --topo single,3 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
c. sudo mn --topo single,8 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
d. sudo mn --topo linear,8  --switch ovsk --controller remote
",,a,c,,"The command 'sudo mn --topo single,8 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote' is used to generate an OpenFlow network topology with a single switch connected to 8 hosts. The '--mac' option specifies that randomly generated MAC addresses should be assigned to each host. The '--switch ovsk' option specifies using Open vSwitch, and '--controller remote' indicates the switch will be managed by a remote controller.","['Mininet Walkthrough - Mininet Documentation (https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Walkthrough)', 'Introduction to Mininet - Open Networking Foundation (https://opennetworking.org/news-and-events/blog/introduction-to-mininet/)']",0,3_mininet_setup,0.95,1
17,What is the purpose of --mac flag used in mininet?,"a. Generates random MAC addresses for the hosts.
b. Generates sequential MAC addresses for the hosts, matching their IP address.
c. Generates sequential MAC addresses for the switch ports, matching their IP address.
d. Generates random MAC addresses for the switch ports.
",,b,b,,"The --mac flag in Mininet is used to generate sequential MAC addresses for the hosts, matching their IP addresses. This means that the host MAC addresses will be predictable based on their IP, which can be useful for testing and debugging purposes. Random MAC addresses are not used by default.","['Mininet Python API Reference: https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Introduction-to-Mininet#wiki-start', 'Mininet: An Instant Virtual Network on your Laptop: https://github.com/mininet/mininet']",1,3_mininet_setup,0.95,1
20,"What is the purpose of dpctl, provided with mininet?","a. To enable visibility and control over a single switchâ€™s flow table.
b. To enable visibility and control over multiple switch flow table.
c. Is an OpenFlow controller.
",,a,a,,"The purpose of dpctl, provided with Mininet, is to enable visibility and control over a single switch's flow table. It allows interacting with the flow table of an individual OpenFlow switch, such as viewing and modifying flow entries.","['Mininet Documentation: http://mininet.org/walkthrough/#dpctl-commands', 'OpenFlow Switch Specification: https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/openflow-spec-v1.3.0.pdf']",1,3_mininet_setup,0.9,1
