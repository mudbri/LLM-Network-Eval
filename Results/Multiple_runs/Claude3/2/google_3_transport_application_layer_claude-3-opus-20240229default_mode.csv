36,What ordering of TCP flags make up the Three-Way Handshake?,"a. SYN, ACK, FIN
b. SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK
c. FIN, FIN/ACK, ACK
d. SYN, ACK, SYN, ACK
",,b,b,,"The Three-Way Handshake in TCP consists of the following flag sequence: SYN (from client to server to initiate connection), SYN/ACK (from server to client to acknowledge the SYN and establish connection parameters), and ACK (from client to server to acknowledge the SYN/ACK and complete the connection establishment).","['TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols by W.

37,"Transport layer protocols, like TCP and UDP, introduce the concept of a port. How many bits are in a port field?","a. 16
b. 4
c. 32
d. 8
",,a,a,,The port field in the TCP and UDP headers is 16 bits long. This allows for port numbers ranging from 0 to 65535. The 16-bit size provides a sufficient number of ports for various services while keeping the header size manageable.,"['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross', 'TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols by W.

38,A device that blocks traffic that meets certain criteria is known as a ________.,"a. Hub
b. Router
c. Switch
d. Firewall
",,d,d,,"A firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies. It acts as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks, such as the Internet. Firewalls block traffic that meets certain predefined criteria to prevent unauthorized access to or from a network.","['NIST Special Publication 800-41 Revision 1: Guidelines on Firewalls and Firewall Policy', 'Cisco Networking Academy: Introduction to Networks v7.0 - Chapter 8: Network Security Concepts']",1,google_3_transport_application_layer,0.95,1
39,Which TCP flag is used to make the listening program respond immediately?,"a. ACK
b. PSH
c. URG
d. RST
",,b,b,,"The PSH (push) flag is used to request immediate processing of the data in the receiver's buffer up to the location indicated by the current sequence number. When the PSH flag is set, the receiving program is notified to process the buffered data immediately, rather than waiting for additional data or a timeout. The ACK flag acknowledges received data, URG indicates urgent data, and RST resets the connection, but none of these force immediate processing by the receiving application like the PSH flag does.","['TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols by W.

40,_________are identified as ports 49152 through 65535.,"a. User ports
b. Ephemeral ports
c. Sockets
d. System ports
",,b,b,,Ephemeral ports are identified as ports 49152 through 65535. These are temporary ports dynamically allocated by the client's operating system for communication sessions initiated by the client. They are used for the client side of a client-server connection after the initial connection request to a well-known port.,"['IANA Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml)', 'TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols by W.

41,"Unlike our five-layer model, the OSI network model adds two more layers on top of the Application Layer. Select examples of these new layers below.","a. The compression layer
b. The session layer
c. The interconnection layer
d. The presentation layer
",,"b,d","b,d",,"The OSI model adds two layers on top of the Application Layer compared to the five-layer model: the Session Layer and the Presentation Layer. The Session Layer manages dialogues (connections) between communicating hosts, while the Presentation Layer provides independence from differences in data representation by translating between application and network formats.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross', 'CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1 by Wendell Odom']",1,google_3_transport_application_layer,0.95,1
42,An example of something that operates at the application layer is:,"a. UDP
b. A router
c. TCP
d. A web browser
",,d,d,,"A web browser operates at the application layer of the OSI model. The application layer is the topmost layer where user applications like web browsers, email clients, and messaging apps reside. These applications rely on the underlying transport layer protocols like TCP and UDP to establish connections and exchange data with remote hosts, but the applications themselves function at the application layer. Routers operate at the network layer to forward packets between networks.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross', 'CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1 by Wendell Odom']",1,google_3_transport_application_layer,0.95,1
44,Which part of the operating system does the application use to communicate the need to establish a TCP connection?,"a. Networking stack
b. ARP message
c. The source port
d. The router
",,a,a,,"The application uses the networking stack of the operating system to communicate the need to establish a TCP connection. The networking stack is responsible for handling the communication protocols, including TCP, and provides an interface for applications to initiate network connections.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross', 'TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols by W.

45,Which of the following sections of the TCP/IP Five-Layer Network Model contain the data the application wants to send? Select all that apply.,"a. The payload section of the Ethernet frame
b. The payload section of the IP Datagram
c. The payload of the TCP segment
d. The header of the Ethernet frame
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"The payload sections of the Ethernet frame, IP datagram, and TCP segment all contain the data that the application wants to send. As data moves down the TCP/IP layers, each layer encapsulates the data from the layer above, with the application data ultimately being carried in the payload section at each layer. The Ethernet frame header does not contain application data, as it holds frame-specific information like MAC addresses.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross, Chapter 1: Computer Networks and the Internet', 'TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols by W.
