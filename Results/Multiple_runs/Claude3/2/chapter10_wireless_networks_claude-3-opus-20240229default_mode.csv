179,"When APs are placed at different geographic locations, they can all be interconnected by a switched infrastructure. The 802.11 standard calls this an extended service set (ESS).","a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",,a,a,,"The statement is true. When access points (APs) are placed at different geographic locations, they can be interconnected by a switched infrastructure to form an extended service set (ESS). An ESS is a set of one or more interconnected basic service sets (BSSs) and their associated APs, which appear as a single BSS to the logical link control layer at any station associated with one of those BSSs. This allows users to roam freely between APs while maintaining seamless connectivity.","['CCNA Wireless 200-355 Official Cert Guide, Chapter 1: Introduction to Wireless Networking Concepts', 'IEEE 802.11-2016 - IEEE Standard for Information technology—Telecommunications and information exchange between systems Local and metropolitan area networks—Specific requirements - Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications']",1,chapter10_wireless_networks,0.95,1
