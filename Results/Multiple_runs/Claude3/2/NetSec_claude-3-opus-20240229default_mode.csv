In an ARP spoofing attack, a malicious actor sends falsified ARP messages over a local area network to associate their MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate device or server. This allows the attacker to intercept, modify or redirect network traffic intended for that IP address.","['CISSP All-in-One Exam Guide, 8th Edition by Shon Harris and Fernando Maymi', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/what-is-arp-spoofing.html', 'https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/arp-spoofing/']",1,NetSec,0.95,1
35,Which one of the following options is the illegitimate DHCP server that is referred to in the context of a DHCP server-based attack? Select one choice.,"a. A sitting duck server
b. A rogue DHCP server
c. A target server
d. An erroneous server
",,b,b,,"In the context of a DHCP server-based attack, a rogue DHCP server is the illegitimate DHCP server. A rogue DHCP server is an unauthorized DHCP server on a network that can provide incorrect IP addressing and configuration information to DHCP clients, potentially redirecting them to malicious servers or causing network disruption.","['CISSP Study Guide by Eric Conrad, Seth Misenar, and Joshua Feldman (2015)', 'CompTIA Security+ SY0-601 Exam Cram by Diane Barrett and Martin Weiss (2021)', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-6500-series-switches/212371-Rogue-DHCP-Server-Detection-and-Mitigati.html']",1,NetSec,0.95,1
36,What is one way of mitigating DHCP attacks by using a Cisco switch? Select one choice.,"a. VLAN segmentation
b. MAC address security
c. DHCP snooping
d. DHCP authentication""
",,c,c,,"DHCP snooping is a security feature on Cisco switches that can help mitigate DHCP attacks. It works by filtering DHCP messages based on trusted and untrusted ports. Untrusted ports are typically access ports where end devices connect. The switch will only allow DHCP requests from untrusted ports and DHCP replies from trusted ports, which are usually uplinks to DHCP servers. This prevents rogue DHCP servers from distributing IP addresses and potential man-in-the-middle attacks.","['Cisco Networking Academy: CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 2', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750x_3560x/software/release/12-2_55_se/configuration/guide/3750xscg/swdhcp82.html']",1,NetSec,0.95,1
