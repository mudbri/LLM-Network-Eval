54,Which of the following properties are characteristics of virtual networks (but not necessarily characteristics of SDN). Select all that apply.,"a. Separates the data and control plane.
b. Refactors network control so that network behavior is controlled from a single logically centralized controller.
c. Separates logical and physical networks.
d. Often deployed in data center networks to allow multiple tenants to share physical network infrastructure.
e. Abstracts the details of the physical network.
",,"c,d,e","c,d,e",,"Virtual networks have the following key characteristics:  c) They separate the logical network topology from the underlying physical network infrastructure. Multiple virtual networks can be overlaid on the same physical network.  d) They are commonly used in multi-tenant data center environments to allow different tenants (customers) to share the same physical network hardware while maintaining isolation between their networks.  e) The physical network details are abstracted and hidden from the virtual networks built on top. The virtual network operates independently of the specifics of the underlying physical network.  While virtual networks and SDN are related concepts that are often used together, properties (a) separating data and control planes, and (b) logically centralized control, are more specific to SDN rather than virtual networks in general.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_network', 'https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/virtual-networking', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/switches/what-is-a-virtual-network.html']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.95,1

",,"a,c,d,e","a,c,d,e",,Virtual links in a virtual network can be created through various methods. Wide-area tunnels using MPLS (a) or IP encapsulation of Ethernet packets (c) enable virtual links across networks.

56,Which of the following are true of the Mininet network emulator? Select all that apply.,"a. It requires running OpenFlow-capable switches.
b. It is difficult to use it to route traffic for real services.
c. Mininet only allows users to create three types of topologies: linear, tree, and single-switch topologies.
d. It can create an emulation that runs across multiple physically distributed nodes.
e. All of the hosts in the topology must run the same underlying operating system.
",,"b,e","b,d",,"Mininet is a network emulator that runs a collection of end-hosts, switches, routers, and links on a single Linux kernel. It does not require running OpenFlow-capable switches (a) as it can emulate them. While it is easy to create various network topologies in Mininet, it is not limited to just linear, tree, and single-switch topologies (c). Mininet can create an emulation that runs across multiple physically distributed nodes (d). However, it is difficult to use Mininet to route traffic for real services (b) as it is primarily designed for testing and research purposes.

b. An emulator makes it possible to ""port"" experiments from one machine to another.
c. An emulator allows the experimenter run real software on each of the nodes in the emulation.
d. An emulation is easier to debug than a simulation.
e. Every run of the emulator will yield exactly the same results, resulting in reproducible experiments.

The emulation environment can be packaged and moved to different hardware, allowing experiments to be reproduced on other machines.  c) An emulator allows the experimenter to run real software on each of the nodes in the emulation. Unlike a simulation which models software behavior, an emulator provides a realistic environment where actual software can be run on emulated hardware.The other options are not necessarily benefits of emulation:a) An emulation may not necessarily complete faster than a simulation, it depends on the complexity. d) An emulation is not necessarily easier to debug than a simulation.e) Emulator runs are not guaranteed to yield exactly the same results each time, as there can still be some variability.","['Emulation vs Simulation: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-emulation-and-simulation/', 'Benefits of Network Emulation: https://www.gns3.com/software/what-is-network-emulation']",1,7_virtual_networking,0.8,1

61,Select the statement that is most true about the relationship between network virtualization and SDNs.,"a. Network virtualization is a potential enabler for software-defined networks, since the separation of data and control planes first requires the creation of a logical network.
b. Software-defined networking is a potential enabler for virtual networks, since separation of data and control planes makes it easier to manage a logical network topology.
c. Network virtualization is a new concept introduced by Amazon, Nicira, and industry players; it only made sense to talk about network virtualization once central SDN controllers existed.
d. Network virtualization and software-defined networking each enable the other: SDN cannot exist without network virtualization, and network virtualization cannot exist without SDN.
",,b,"a,b",,"Both statements a and b are true about the relationship between network virtualization and SDNs. Network virtualization enables the creation of logical networks separate from the underlying physical infrastructure, which is a prerequisite for implementing SDNs that decouple the control and data planes. At the same time, SDN principles like the separation of control and data planes make it easier to manage and orchestrate virtual network topologies. So network virtualization and SDN are complementary technologies that enable and strengthen each other, but one is not strictly dependent on the other.","['https://www.networkworld.com/article/3247792/network-virtualization-and-sdn-whats-the-difference.html', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/virtualization/definitions/whats-network-virtualization/']",0,7_virtual_networking,0.9,1
