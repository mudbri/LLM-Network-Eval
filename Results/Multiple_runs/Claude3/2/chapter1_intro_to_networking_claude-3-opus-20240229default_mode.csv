1,Which of the following terms describe Ethernet addresses that can send one frame and is delivered to multiple devices on the LAN? (Choose two answers.),"a. Broadcast address
b. Multicast address
c. IP address
d. MAC address
e. Unicast address
",,"a,b","a,b",,"Broadcast and multicast addresses are used to send Ethernet frames to multiple devices on a LAN. A broadcast address (FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF) sends the frame to all devices, while a multicast address sends the frame to a specific group of devices that have subscribed to that multicast group. IP addresses operate at Layer 3 and are not used for Layer 2 Ethernet addressing. MAC addresses and unicast addresses refer to a single device on the LAN.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Wendell Odom, Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,0.95,1

b. CSMA/CA
c. TCP/IP
d. TCP/UDP
",,a,a,,"CSMA/CD, which stands for Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection, is a set of rules that determines how network devices respond when two devices send data at the same time on the same network segment, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, the devices stop transmitting, wait for a random time interval, and then retry the transmission. This helps to minimize collisions and ensures efficient use of the network medium.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1 by Wendell Odom (Chapter 3: Fundamentals of LANs)', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/lan-switching/ethernet/5234-csma-cd.html']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,0.95,1

b. FALSE
",,a,a,,"The statement is true. When a user enters a hostname like www.examsdigest.com in a web browser, the computer does not directly send an IP packet to that hostname.

The computer sends a DNS query to a DNS server, which then returns the IP address associated with the hostname. Once the computer has the IP address, it can then send the IP packet to that address to establish communication with the web server.","['Cisco CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1, Chapter 3: Fundamentals of WANs and IP Routing', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,1,1
