91,You have noticed that a server with IP 145.45.3.2 doesn’t respond to requests. What command will you type first in order to test connectivity between your device and the server?,"a. request 145.45.3.2
b. check 145.45.3.2
c. ping 145.45.3.2
d. ping 145.45.3.2
",,c,c,,"The 'ping' command is the standard tool used to test the reachability of a host on an IP network and measure the round-trip time for messages sent from the originating host to a destination computer. It works by sending ICMP 'echo request' packets to the target host and waiting for an ICMP 'echo reply'. So to test connectivity to the server at 145.45.3.2, you would use the command 'ping 145.45.3.2'.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1, Chapter 16: IP Services, Cisco Press', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ios-nx-os-software/ios-software-releases-121-mainline/12778-ping-traceroute.html']",1,chapter5_ipv4_routing,0.95,1

However, only interface G0/1 is bundled into the channel and working. Think about the configuration settings on port G0/2 that could have existed before adding G0/2 to the EtherChannel. Which answers identify a setting that could prevent IOS from adding G0/2 to the Layer 3 EtherChannel? (Choose two answers.)","a. A different STP cost (spanning-tree cost value)
b. A different access VLAN (switchport access vlan vlanid)
c. A different speed (speed value)
d. A default setting for switchport (switchport)
