72,"In NFV, which of the following is the function of steering?","a. Finding the best location to place a single network function in an enterprise or wide area network.
b. Installing custom packet processing code on servers in the network.
c. Placing middleboxes at places throughout the network to minimize network load.
d. Installing custom packet processing code on switches in the network.
e. Installing flow table entries in switches to forward traffic through network functions or middleboxes that are installed in the network
",,e,e,,"In Network Function Virtualization (NFV), steering refers to the process of directing network traffic flows through a sequence of network functions or middleboxes. This is typically achieved by installing flow table entries in the switches of the network. These flow table entries match on certain packet header fields and specify the next hop for the matched packets, which could be a network function, middlebox, or the next switch in the path. By setting up the appropriate flow table entries, the network can steer traffic through the desired set of network functions before delivering it to the final destination.","['Network Function Virtualization (NFV) Explained, SDxCentral, https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/nfv/definitions/whats-network-functions-virtualization-nfv/', 'Network Functions Virtualization - Everything You Need to Know, A10 Networks, https://www.a10networks.com/blog/network-functions-virtualization-everything-you-need-to-know/']",1,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.95,1
74,What are some advantages of Docker containers over virtual machines? Select all that apply.,"a. Containers can be connected to build a virtual network, whereas virtual machines cannot.
b. Performance in containers may be better since they invoke OS system calls directly, rather than through an emulated machine.
c. Containers require less storage and memory per-instance, and require less time to instantiate than virtual machines.
d. Containers provide more flexibility in the choice of operating system.
e. Containers provide better isolation than virtual machines.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"Containers can provide better performance than virtual machines since they invoke OS system calls directly rather than going through an emulated machine (b). Containers also typically require less storage, memory, and startup time compared to virtual machines since they share the host OS kernel and libraries (c). While containers can be networked together (a), virtual machines can also be networked. Containers actually provide less flexibility in OS choice (d) since they must use the same OS kernel as the host. And virtual machines generally provide stronger isolation than containers (e).","['https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/', 'https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/containers-vs-vms', 'https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/containers-vs-vms']",1,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.95,1
75,Which of the following commands is used to instantiate a new Docker container by invoking a command in that container?,"a. docker stop
b. docker attach
c. docker commit
d. docker pull
e. docker run
",,e,e,,The 'docker run' command is used to create and start a new container from an image. It allows you to specify the image to use and the command to run inside the container when it starts. The other options are incorrect because: - 'docker stop' is used to stop a running container. - 'docker attach' is used to attach to a running container. - 'docker commit' is used to create a new image from a container's changes. - 'docker pull' is used to pull an image from a registry.,"['https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/', 'https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#docker-objects']",1,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.95,1
76,Which of the following is true about networking Docker containers? Select all that apply.,"a. Docker containers can be networked to each other via the native Docker bridge or Open vSwitch.
b. A Docker container can never expose a low port (e.g., port 80) to the external Internet; Internet hosts must always reach a Docker service by a high port (e.g., 8080).
c. Docker containers running in different virtual machines cannot be networked together.
d. Connecting Docker containers requires setting up GRE tunnels between the containers.
e. Docker containers are not reachable from the external Internet by default.
",,"a,e","a,e",,"Docker containers can be networked to each other using the native Docker bridge or Open vSwitch (a). By default, Docker containers are not directly reachable from the external Internet for security reasons (e). However, Docker containers can be configured to expose any port, including low ports like 80, to the external Internet by publishing the port (b is incorrect). Docker containers running on different VMs can be networked together using various methods like overlay networks (c is incorrect). Connecting Docker containers does not require setting up GRE tunnels specifically (d is incorrect).","['https://docs.docker.com/network/', 'https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/', 'https://www.docker.com/blog/understanding-docker-networking-drivers-use-cases/']",1,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.95,1
