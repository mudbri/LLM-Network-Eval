194,"Examine the following show command output on a router configured for dynamic NAT:
""â€” Inside Source

type generic, total addresses 10, allocated 10 (100%), misses 595""
You are responsible to find out why users are not being able to reach the Internet.","a. The cause is not related to dynamic NAT
b. The command output does not provide any clue to identify the problem
c. Dynamic NAT can't use Standard ACLs
d. The NAT pool does not have enough entries to fulfill the user's requests
",,d,d,,"The output shows that the NAT pool 'examsdigest' has a total of 10 addresses available, and all 10 have been allocated (100% utilization). Additionally, there have been 595 'misses', meaning there were 595 attempts to allocate an address from the pool when none were available. This indicates the NAT pool is exhausted and does not have enough entries to fulfill all the requests from users trying to access the Internet.","['Cisco CCNA Official Cert Guide, Chapter 10: Network Address Translation', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/network-address-translation-nat/13772-12.html']",1,chapter11_ip_services,0.95,1

b. 3
c. 4
d. 5
",,c,c,,"In Cisco IOS, severity level 4 corresponds to Warning messages. These indicate a warning condition that should be monitored and may require attention, but do not necessarily impact the functioning of the device.

c. 4
d. 5
",,b,b,,"Severity level 6 corresponds to informational messages in Cisco IOS. These messages are not errors, but rather provide information about normal system operation and status.

b. FALSE
",,a,a,,Message integrity is one of the key features introduced in SNMPv3.

b. show cdp
c. show running-config
d. show interface brief
",,b,b,,"The 'show cdp' command is used to display the status and global configuration of Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) on a Cisco device. It will indicate whether CDP is enabled or disabled globally on the device. The other options are incorrect because: - 'show protocols' displays the status of routing protocols, not CDP. - 'show running-config' displays the entire running configuration, which would include CDP settings but not directly show the CDP status. - 'show interface brief' provides a summary of interface statuses but does not include CDP information.","['Cisco IOS Network Management Command Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/netmgmt/command/nm-cr-book/nm-s1.html#wp3893078360', 'Cisco CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Chapter 11: IP Services, CDP section']",1,chapter11_ip_services,0.95,1

Host A and host B attach to the same LAN and have correct default router settings per the FHRP configuration. Which of the following statements is true for this LAN?","a. You can't connect two routers to the same LAN subnet.
b. If one router fails, hosts can't send packets off-subnet
c. If one router fails, both hosts will use the one remaining router as a default router
d. if one router fails, only one of the two hosts will still be able to send packets off-subnet
",,c,c,,"In a LAN with two routers using a First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP) like HSRP or VRRP, if one router fails, the other router will take over as the active router. All hosts on the LAN will then use the remaining active router as their default gateway to send packets off-subnet.
