",,c,c,,"Mesh networking allows multiple wireless access points to work together as a single network. In a mesh network, the access points communicate with each other to extend the wireless coverage area. If one access point fails, the others can still communicate with each other, providing a level of fault tolerance. Mesh networks are self-healing and can be easily expanded by adding more nodes.","['Cisco Networking Academy: Introduction to Networks v7.0 - Chapter 7: Wireless Networks', 'CompTIA Network+ Certification All-in-One Exam Guide, Seventh Edition (Exam N10-007) by Mike Meyers', 'IEEE 802.11s - Mesh Networking standard']",1,Computer_Networking,0.95,1

b. Infrastructure mode
c. Mesh networking
d. Wi-Fi Direct
",,b,b,,"Infrastructure mode is the wireless technology that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network. In this mode, wireless devices communicate with each other through an access point, which acts as a central hub to connect them to the wired network infrastructure. Ad-hoc mode allows wireless devices to communicate directly with each other without an access point, while mesh networking and Wi-Fi Direct are technologies for device-to-device communication without necessarily connecting to a wired network.","['CompTIA Network+ Certification All-in-One Exam Guide, Seventh Edition (Exam N10-007) by Mike Meyers', 'Cisco Networking Academy: Introduction to Networks v7.0', 'IEEE 802.11-2016 - IEEE Standard for Information technology—Telecommunications and information exchange between systems Local and metropolitan area networks—Specific requirements - Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications']",1,Computer_Networking,0.95,1

",,b,b,,NFC (Near Field Communication) is the wireless technology commonly used for contactless payment systems. NFC operates at very short ranges (typically a few centimeters) and allows secure communication between a payment terminal and a contactless card or mobile device. This makes it well-suited for applications like mobile payments where the user simply taps their card or phone on the payment terminal.,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication', 'https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/near-field-communication-nfc.asp']",1,Computer_Networking,0.95,1
