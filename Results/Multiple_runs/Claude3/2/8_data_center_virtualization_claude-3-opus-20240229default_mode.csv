62,Which of the following are true of “network slicing”? Select all that apply.,"a. Network operators can use slicing to test configurations on “shadow” networks that mirror a production network topology.
b. One way to slice networks is according to “flow space”, whereby different controllers might control distinct and non-overlapping traffic flows.
c. A controller can prevent one network slice from interfering with the resources of another.
d. Multi-tenant datacenters are one use case for network slicing.
e. Conventional (i.e., non-SDN) networks have no concept of network virtualization or slicing.
",,"a,b,d","a,b,c,d",,"Network slicing allows creating multiple logical networks over a shared physical infrastructure. Slices can be used to test configurations on shadow networks mirroring production (a), can be sliced by distinct non-overlapping traffic flows (b), and controllers can isolate resources between slices (c). Multi-tenant datacenters are indeed a key use case for slicing (d). However, conventional networks do have some virtualization and slicing concepts like VLANs and VRFs, so (e) is incorrect.","['https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/nfv/definitions/what-is-network-slicing/', 'https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-definition/', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/ios-nx-os-software/virtual-routing-forwarding-vrf/index.html']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.95,1
63,Which of the following are true about flow spaces? Select all that apply.,"a. Two flow spaces cannot overlap.
b. One host could send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces.
c. Flow spaces can only be defined according to combinations of packet header fields.
d. Flowspace isolation separates individual virtual networks from one another but incurs some performance penalty for doing so.
e. Two controllers that write data-plane rules for non-overlapping parts of flowspace can never cause traffic from one “slice” to enter the other slice.
",,b,"b,d",,"Two statements are true about flow spaces:b) One host could indeed send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces, depending on how the flow spaces are defined. For example, if flow spaces are defined based on destination IP ranges, and a host sends traffic to IPs in both ranges, its traffic would end up in both flow spaces.  d) Flowspace isolation does separate individual virtual networks but incurs a performance penalty to enforce this separation. The isolation requires additional processing and rule checking to ensure traffic stays within its designated flow space.The other statements are false:a) Flow spaces can overlap. In fact, overlapping flow spaces are sometimes used to enable communication between virtual networks when needed.c) Flow spaces can be defined by other attributes beyond just packet header fields, such as physical ports. e) Two controllers writing rules for non-overlapping flow spaces could still cause traffic to cross if the flow space definitions are incorrect or there are bugs in the controller software.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/images/stories/downloads/sdn-resources/technical-reports/TR_SDN_ARCH_1.0_06062014.pdf', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128613001345']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,1
64,Which of the following describe the control-plane checks that FlowVisor implements? Select all that apply.,"a. When a packet must be forwarded to a controller, Flowvisor forwards traffic to the correct controller based on which controller “owns” the flowspace corresponding to that packet.
b. Flowvisor prevents each slice's controller from being the target of a denial of service attack from other slices.
c. Flowvisor can only instantiate network slices based on the network topology, not based on other properties, such as application traffic.
d. Flowvisor prevents a controller from writing data-plane rules to a part of flowspace that it does not own.
e. Flowvisor installs traffic shaping and quality of service rules to ensure that each network slice has guaranteed resources.
",,"a,d","a,d",,"FlowVisor performs control-plane checks to ensure that each controller only operates on its own slice or flowspace. This includes (a) forwarding packets to the correct controller based on flowspace ownership, and (d) preventing controllers from writing data-plane rules to flowspaces they do not own. The other options are incorrect: (b) DoS protection is not a core function of FlowVisor, (c) FlowVisor can slice the network based on various properties beyond just topology, and (e) traffic shaping/QoS is handled separately from FlowVisor's core slicing functionality.","['https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/papers/flowvisor09.pdf', 'https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/flowvisor-latest.pdf']",1,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,1
65,Which of the following are applications in a home network that network slicing could enable? Select all that apply.,"a. Quality of service for certain applications (e.g., video streaming)
b. Traceback of attack traffic to its source
c. Smart grid applications
d. Load balance of inbound traffic
e. Guest WiFi access
",,"a,c,e","a,c,e",,"Network slicing could enable the following applications in a home network:  a) Quality of service for certain applications like video streaming. Network slicing allows dedicating specific network resources and performance characteristics to high-priority applications.   c) Smart grid applications. Network slicing can provide isolated, secure slices for IoT devices and applications like smart meters and energy management.   e) Guest WiFi access. A dedicated network slice can be provisioned for guest users, keeping that traffic separate from the main home network for security.   The other options, traceback of attack traffic (b) and load balancing inbound traffic (d), are more relevant to service provider or enterprise networks rather than typical home network use cases for network slicing.","['https://www.ericsson.com/en/blog/2021/11/network-slicing-future-proofing-smart-home', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9705183', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8871966/']",1,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,1
69,What are examples of multi-tenant datacenter applications? Select all that apply.,"a. Amazon hosting EC2 instances for customers
b. A home network owner running a private and public WiFi network
c. A retailer running a large, multi-site enterprise network across its global network of sites
d. Google running Gmail and search from a common facility
e. Two enterprises hosting data in a shared facility.
",,"a,d,e","a,d,e",,"Multi-tenant datacenter applications involve multiple customers or tenants sharing common computing resources and infrastructure. Amazon hosting EC2 instances for customers (a) is an example, as Amazon's cloud infrastructure is used to run virtual machines for many different customers. Similarly, Google running Gmail and search from a common facility (d) represents multi-tenancy, as the same datacenter resources are used to provide services to a large number of users. Two enterprises hosting data in a shared facility (e) is another case of multi-tenancy at the physical datacenter level. In contrast, a home network with private and public WiFi (b) and a retailer's global enterprise network (c) are single-tenant scenarios, as the network infrastructure is dedicated to a single entity in each case.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy', 'https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/', 'https://cloud.google.com/security/overview/whitepaper']",1,8_data_center_virtualization,0.95,1
70,What best describes the relationship between network virtualization and SDN? Select all that apply.,"a. SDN controllers can help manage storage and data facilities, in addition to network configuration
b. SDN predates network virtualization
c. Network virtualization requires SDN
d. SDN makes some aspects of network virtualization easier to manage
e. Network virtualization enables SDN
",,"a,d",d,,"SDN can make some aspects of network virtualization easier to manage. SDN separates the control plane from the data plane, allowing network configuration and policies to be managed centrally through software. This abstraction and programmability enables more flexible and dynamic management of virtualized network resources. However, network virtualization does not strictly require SDN and existed before SDN. SDN is also not limited to just managing network configuration, but can extend to storage and other IT infrastructure.","['https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/software-defined-networking.html', 'https://www.juniper.net/us/en/research-topics/what-is-sdn.html', 'https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization/what-is-sdn']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,1
