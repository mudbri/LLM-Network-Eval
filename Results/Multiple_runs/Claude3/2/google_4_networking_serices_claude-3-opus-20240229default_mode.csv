46,What transport layer protocol does DNS normally use?,"a. TCP
b. IP
c. UDP
d. ICMP
",,c,c,,"DNS normally uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) as its transport layer protocol. UDP is a lightweight, connectionless protocol that allows for fast transmission of small amounts of data, which is well-suited for the typically small queries and responses in DNS. TCP is used in some cases where the DNS response data exceeds a certain size threshold and is truncated over UDP, requiring the retry over TCP.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross', 'RFC 1035 - Domain Names - Implementation and Specification, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035', 'DNS Transport over TCP - Implementation Requirements, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7766']",1,google_4_networking_serices,0.95,1
