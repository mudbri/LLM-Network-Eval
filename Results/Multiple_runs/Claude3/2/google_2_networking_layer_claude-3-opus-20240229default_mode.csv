c. Class Interconnect Destination Routing
d. Classless Inter-Domain Routing
",,d,d,,CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing. It is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing Internet Protocol packets.

d. 192.168.1.0\24
",,c,c,,"CIDR notation is a compact representation of an IP address and its associated network mask. The correct format is an IP address, followed by a forward slash, and then the number of network bits.

28,How many octets does a subnet mask have?,"a. 1
b. 3
c. 4
d. 2
",,c,c,,"A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that masks an IP address and divides the IP address into network address and host address.

",,c,c,,"The subnet ID is represented by the first two octets of the subnet mask, which are 255.255 in this case. The subnet mask 255.255.0.0 indicates that the first two octets (16 bits) are used for the network ID, and the remaining two octets (16 bits) are used for host IDs within the subnet.

b. Distance-Vector Protocols
c. Hypertext Transfer Protocol
d. Transmission Control Protocol
",,"a,b","a,b",,The two main types of Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) are Link State Routing Protocols and Distance-Vector Protocols. Link State Routing Protocols like OSPF and IS-IS build a complete topology of the network and calculate the best path. Distance-Vector Protocols like RIP determine the best path based on a metric like hop count.

d. Interior gateway protocols share information with multiple autonomous systems. Exterior Gateway Protocols are used for the exchange of information between independent autonomous systems.
",,b,b,,"Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) are used for sharing routing information within a single autonomous system (AS). An autonomous system is a network or group of networks under a common administration and with common routing policies. Examples of IGPs include RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP. On the other hand, Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs) are used to exchange routing information between different autonomous systems. EGPs are designed to exchange routing information between independent systems that may have different routing policies. The primary EGP used today is the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross', 'CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1 by Wendell Odom', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/13753-25.html']",1,google_2_networking_layer,0.95,1
