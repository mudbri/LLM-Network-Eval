",,d,c,,"The subnet mask 255.255.255.0 is a /24 mask, which means that the first 24 bits are network and subnet bits, while the remaining 8 bits are host bits. In this case, the IP address 10.20.30.5 belongs to a Class A network, where the first octet (8 bits) represents the network portion. The second and third octets (16 bits) are used for subnetting, and the last octet (8 bits) is used for host addressing. Therefore, the correct distribution of bits is: Network Bits = 8, Subnet Bits = 8, and Host Bits = 16.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Wendell Odom, Cisco Press, 2020', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html']",0,chapter4_advanced_ipv4_addressing,0.95,1
