137,"In a spoofing attack, which of the following parameters are commonly spoofed? (Choose two answers)","a. Source IP address
b. MAC address
c. ARP address
d. Routing table
e. Destination IP address
f. ARP table
",,"a,b","a,b",,"In a spoofing attack, the two most commonly spoofed parameters are the source IP address and the MAC address. By spoofing the source IP address, an attacker can make it appear as if the traffic is originating from a trusted or legitimate source. Spoofing the MAC address allows the attacker to impersonate another device on the local network. The other choices, such as ARP address, routing table, destination IP address, and ARP table, are not typically spoofed in a spoofing attack.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Wendell Odom, Cisco Press, 2020', 'Network Security Essentials: Applications and Standards, William Stallings, Pearson, 2017']",1,chapter8_security_fundamentals,0.95,1
