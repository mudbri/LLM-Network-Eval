218,Which of the following configuration management tools uses agentless architecture for managing network devices?,"a. Ansible
b. Puppet
c. Chef
d. Ansible and Puppet
e. Puppet and Chef
",,a,a,,Ansible uses an agentless architecture for managing network devices. It connects to devices over SSH or API and does not require any agent software to be installed on the managed devices. Puppet and Chef both use an agent-based architecture where an agent program needs to be installed on each managed device to communicate with the central server.,"['Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Documentation: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.2/html/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_installation_guide/architecture-overview', 'Puppet Documentation: https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/architecture.html', 'Chef Documentation: https://docs.chef.io/server/architecture/']",1,chapter13_network_automation,0.95,1

b. Management plane
c. Control Plane
d. None of the above
",,a,a,,"The data plane of a switch is responsible for forwarding frames based on the destination MAC address.

228,"Your company decides to move away from manual configuration methods, making changes by editing centralized configuration files. The issues you are facing with non-centralized configuration files are:
1) You don’t know who engineer made the changes in the configuration file.
2) You don’t know the changes in the configuration file over time.
Which tool your company will use in order to solve these issues?","a. Version Control System
b. Version Control Configuration
c. Version Control Change
d. Version Control Edit
",,a,a,,"A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that helps manage changes to files over time. It allows multiple users to collaborate on the same set of files, tracking who made changes, when they were made, and what specifically was changed. VCS also maintains a history of all versions of the files, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed. This addresses the issues mentioned in the question, where you need to know who made changes to configuration files and track the changes over time. Therefore, moving to a Version Control System is the correct solution for the company's centralized configuration management needs.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control', 'https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control']",1,chapter13_network_automation,0.95,1
