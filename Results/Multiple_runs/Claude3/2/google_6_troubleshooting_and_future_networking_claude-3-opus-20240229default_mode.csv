90,The protocol used to communicate network errors is known as __________.,"a. ICMP
b. Traceroute
c. TCP
d. UDP
",,a,a,,"ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is used to communicate network errors and operational information. It is used by network devices like routers to generate error messages to the source IP address when network problems prevent delivery of IP packets. ICMP is not used to exchange data between systems, but rather to communicate network-level information.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13730-ext-ping-trace.html']",1,google_6_troubleshooting_and_future_networking,0.95,1
91,The ping utility sends what message type?,"a. Echo Request
b. Echo Reply
c. Destination Network Unknown
d. Destination Network Unreachable
",,a,a,,"The ping utility sends ICMP Echo Request messages to a specified host to test network connectivity.

94,"During a traceroute, which action does a router perform to the value in the Time To Live (TTL) field?","a. Multiplication
b. Division
c. Subtraction
d. Addition
",,c,c,,"During a traceroute, each router that receives the packet subtracts one from the Time To Live (TTL) value before forwarding the packet to the next hop. If the TTL reaches zero, the router discards the packet and sends an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the source. This process allows traceroute to map the path a packet takes from the source to the destination by incrementing the starting TTL value and tracking the ICMP Time Exceeded messages.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceroute']",1,google_6_troubleshooting_and_future_networking,0.95,1
