16,Which of the following command is used to generate an OpenFlow network topology consisting of a single switch and 8 hosts with randomly generated MAC addresses for each host?,"a. sudo mn --topo single,8  --switch ovsk --controller remote
b. sudo mn --topo single,3 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
c. sudo mn --topo single,8 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
d. sudo mn --topo linear,8  --switch ovsk --controller remote
",,a,c,,"The correct command to generate an OpenFlow network topology consisting of a single switch and 8 hosts with randomly generated MAC addresses for each host is 'sudo mn --topo single,8 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote'. This command specifies a single switch (--topo single) connected to 8 hosts (--topo single,8) with randomly generated MAC addresses (--mac), using the Open vSwitch (--switch ovsk) as the switch type and a remote controller (--controller remote).",[],0,3_mininet_setup,0.9,0.9979168644448096
17,What is the purpose of --mac flag used in mininet?,"a. Generates random MAC addresses for the hosts.
b. Generates sequential MAC addresses for the hosts, matching their IP address.
c. Generates sequential MAC addresses for the switch ports, matching their IP address.
d. Generates random MAC addresses for the switch ports.
",,b,a,,The --mac flag in Mininet is used to generate random MAC addresses for the hosts. This helps in avoiding conflicts and ensures uniqueness of MAC addresses within the network.,['https://github.com/mininet/mininet/issues/570'],0,3_mininet_setup,0.9,0.6733893753504434
20,"What is the purpose of dpctl, provided with mininet?","a. To enable visibility and control over a single switchâ€™s flow table.
b. To enable visibility and control over multiple switch flow table.
c. Is an OpenFlow controller.
",,a,a,,"The purpose of dpctl, provided with Mininet, is to enable visibility and control over a single switch's flow table. It allows users to interact with the datapath of a particular switch in a Mininet network.",[],1,3_mininet_setup,0.9,0.9969628550844032
