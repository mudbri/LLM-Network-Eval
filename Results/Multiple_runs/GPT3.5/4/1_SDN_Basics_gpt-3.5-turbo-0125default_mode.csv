1,Which of the following are true about Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)? Select all that apply.,"a. The only sizes for an IP address allocation before CIDR were 8, 16, or 24 bits.
b. The prefix length for a CIDR prefix can be anywhere in the range from 0 to 32 bits.
c. In an Internet forwarding table with CIDR, there can only be one unique matching entry for any given IP address.
d. CIDR slowed the rate of Internet routing table growth because prefixes no longer had to be allocated in fixed-size blocks.
",,"b,d","b,d",,"Option b is correct because CIDR allows for variable prefix lengths ranging from 0 to 32 bits, providing more flexibility in address allocation. Option d is also true as CIDR helped slow the rate of Internet routing table growth by allowing for the allocation of prefixes in variable sizes instead of fixed blocks.",[],1,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.997643332424641
2,Which of the following are true about how DNS lookups work? Select all that apply.,"a. A DNS A-record query for google.com will only return a single IP address at a time.
b. An NS-record query for a DNS lookup will return the name(s) of the authoritative name server(s) for that domain.
c. If your local DNS resolver caches an NS record for google.com for multiple days, all clients who use that DNS resolver will continue using the same IP address to reach Google’s Web server until that NS record expires.
d. An MX-record query for a DNS lookup will return the IP address of the mail server for that domain.
e. All DNS PTR records are maintained by a single organization in-addr.arpa.
",,b,"a,b",,Option a is correct because a DNS A-record query for a domain like google.com typically returns a single IP address associated with that domain. Option b is also correct as an NS-record query returns the authoritative name server(s) for the domain.,"['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-a-record/', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-ns-record/']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.518802096433453
3,Which of the following are true about traffic control with BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
b. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
c. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
d. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
",,"a,b","a,b",,"Option a is correct because a network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to influence outbound traffic from their AS to a destination by indicating to neighboring ASes which path to prefer. Option b is also correct because AS path prepending can be used by a network operator to influence inbound traffic to their AS by making their AS path less preferred, thus diverting traffic through other paths.",['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/13753-25.html'],1,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.9997840040104933
4,Which of the following are true about layering? Select all that apply.,"a. The network layer guarantees reliable, in-order delivery of packets.
b. The network layer has only a single protocol in widespread use today, representing what we call the “narrow waist”.
c. The transport layer uses port numbers.
d. The destination address in the link layer header is always the address of the next layer-3 node along an end-to-end IP path.
",,"b,c",c,,"The statement 'The transport layer uses port numbers' is correct. Port numbers are used by the transport layer to differentiate between different applications running on the same device. The other options are incorrect: a. The network layer does not guarantee reliable, in-order delivery of packets; this is the responsibility of the transport layer. b. The network layer has multiple protocols in widespread use today, not just a single protocol. d. The destination address in the link layer header is not always the address of the next layer-3 node along an end-to-end IP path; it is usually the address of the immediate next hop in the local network.",[],0,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.9992824651813167
5,Which of the following are not true about packet switching? Select all that apply.,"a. Once a connection is established between two endpoints in a packet switched network, the end-to-end route cannot change, or the connection must be re-established.
b. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will always experience predictable latency.
c. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will never be dropped by intermediate nodes along the path.
d. A user of a packet switched network might occasionally get a “busy signal” if there are too many users on the network.
",,"a,b,c,d","a,b,c",,"Option a is not true because in packet switching, the end-to-end route can change dynamically without the need to re-establish the connection. Option b is not true because traffic over a packet-switched network can experience varying latency depending on network conditions. Option c is not true because packets can be dropped by intermediate nodes in a packet-switched network, especially during congestion or network failures.",[],0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.9211604381059388
6,Which of the following are true about content distribution networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Content distribution networks can improve the performance that a client sees by reducing the network latency between the client and the content that it is downloading.
b. Content distribution networks can reduce transit expenses for a content provider by enabling much of the provider’s content to be served from a nearby network, sometimes even from a cache that is within the client’s own network.
c. Real-time content such as video streams cannot be distributed from a content distribution network.
d. Content distribution networks typically redirect Web clients to a nearby Web cache by rewriting the IP address of packets sent from the client to the IP address of the nearby Web cache.
",,"a,b","a,b",,Option a is correct because content distribution networks (CDNs) can indeed improve client performance by reducing network latency through caching content closer to end-users. Option b is also true as CDNs can reduce transit expenses for content providers by serving content from nearby networks or even within the client's network.,['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/'],1,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.9999988975533177
7,Which of the following are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control? Select all that apply.,"a. Only wireless networks can have collisions at the receiver; such collisions are not possible on wired Ethernet networks.
b. Using RTS/CTS (“request to send”, “clear to send”) control reduces the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network.
c. A wireless sender can avoid causing a collision at the receiver by performing a “carrier sense” to determine whether any other sender wants to transmit at the time that it wishes to send a packet.
d. Disabling RTS/CTS necessarily lowers the effective throughput of the wireless network, since more collisions will occur at the receiver without RTS/CTS enabled.
",,b,c,,"Option c is correct. In 802.11 wireless medium access control, a wireless sender can indeed avoid causing a collision at the receiver by performing a 'carrier sense' to check if any other sender wants to transmit at that time. This mechanism helps in collision avoidance in wireless networks.",['https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/carrier-sense-multiple-access-with-collision-avoidance-csma-ca'],0,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.693492509704549
8,Which of the following are true about video streaming? Select all that apply.,"a. Using UDP to stream a video instead of TCP is appropriate if the client is more concerned about low delay and interactivity than it does about receiving a high-quality stream.
b. A larger playout buffer at the client allows the client more time to recover from lost packets.
c. Using TCP for video streaming could result in larger delays between transmission and playout than streaming the same video with UDP.
d. Since UDP provides no reliable delivery guarantees, a video streaming application that uses UDP as its transport cannot recover from any packet loss in the video stream.
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"a. Using UDP for video streaming is appropriate when low delay and interactivity are prioritized over high-quality stream reception due to UDP's lower overhead and reduced error recovery mechanisms, which can lead to faster transmission. b. A larger playout buffer at the client allows more time to recover from lost packets by providing a cushion for retransmission or error concealment techniques. c. TCP can introduce larger delays between transmission and playout compared to UDP due to its congestion control mechanisms and retransmission of lost packets, which can impact real-time streaming applications.","['https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/v/video-streaming.htm', 'https://www.pearsonitcertification.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2824035']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.9747194442298199
9,Which of the following are true about TCP? Select all that apply.,"a. TCP guarantees that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted.
b. A TCP sender and receiver use a “three-way handshake” both to set up and to terminate the TCP connection.
c. TCP’s congestion avoidance algorithm causes the sender to reduce its sending rate by a factor of two when it sees a packet loss.
d. A TCP sender controls its sending rate by adjusting the number of unacknowledged packets that can be sent over the network at any time.

10,Which of the following are true about denial of service attacks (and defenses)? Select all that apply.,"a. If every network on the Internet performed stateless ingress filtering to defend against source IP spoofing, the DNS reflection attack would not work.
b. If every network on the Internet performed stateless egress filtering to defend against source IP address spoofing, the DNS reflection attack could not be carried out.
c. In a “SYN Flood” attack, each TCP SYN packet that a victim receives causes it to set up TCP connection state.
d. A “DNS Reflection” attack requires the attacking client to “spoof” the source IP address of the packet containing the DNS request.
",,"b,c,d","a,d",,"Option a is correct because if every network on the Internet performed stateless ingress filtering to defend against source IP spoofing, the DNS reflection attack would not work as the attacker would not be able to spoof the source IP address. Option d is also correct as a 'DNS Reflection' attack indeed requires the attacking client to spoof the source IP address of the packet containing the DNS request to amplify the attack.",[],0,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.6495059396211865
