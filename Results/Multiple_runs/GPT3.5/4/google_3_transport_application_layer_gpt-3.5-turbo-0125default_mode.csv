36,What ordering of TCP flags make up the Three-Way Handshake?,"a. SYN, ACK, FIN
b. SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK
c. FIN, FIN/ACK, ACK
d. SYN, ACK, SYN, ACK
",,b,b,,"The correct ordering of TCP flags in the Three-Way Handshake is SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK. In this process, the client sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server, the server responds with a SYN/ACK (synchronize-acknowledgment) packet, and finally, the client sends an ACK (acknowledgment) packet to complete the connection establishment.",['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Connection_establishment'],1,google_3_transport_application_layer,0.95,0.9999988527586581
37,"Transport layer protocols, like TCP and UDP, introduce the concept of a port. How many bits are in a port field?","a. 16
b. 4
c. 32
d. 8
",,a,a,,"The port field in TCP and UDP headers is 16 bits long. This allows for a total of 2^16 (65,536) possible port numbers, which are used to differentiate between different applications or services running on a single device.","['https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc768', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793']",1,google_3_transport_application_layer,0.9,0.9999367496503877
38,A device that blocks traffic that meets certain criteria is known as a ________.,"a. Hub
b. Router
c. Switch
d. Firewall
",,d,d,,A device that blocks traffic based on certain criteria is known as a firewall.

39,Which TCP flag is used to make the listening program respond immediately?,"a. ACK
b. PSH
c. URG
d. RST
",,b,b,,"The TCP flag used to make the listening program respond immediately is the PSH (Push) flag. When the PSH flag is set in a TCP segment, it indicates to the receiving end to deliver the data to the application immediately without buffering.",['https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-network-tcp-flags/'],1,google_3_transport_application_layer,0.9,0.4803655511633375

b. Ephemeral ports
c. Sockets
d. System ports
",,b,b,,Ports 49152 through 65535 are known as ephemeral ports. These ports are used as temporary ports for outbound connections by the operating system.,[],1,google_3_transport_application_layer,0.9,0.999978707566687
41,"Unlike our five-layer model, the OSI network model adds two more layers on top of the Application Layer. Select examples of these new layers below.","a. The compression layer
b. The session layer
c. The interconnection layer
d. The presentation layer
",,"b,d","b,d",,"The correct options are b - The session layer and d - The presentation layer. The OSI model has seven layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application. The session layer (b) manages the sessions or connections between different nodes in a network.

44,Which part of the operating system does the application use to communicate the need to establish a TCP connection?,"a. Networking stack
b. ARP message
c. The source port
d. The router
",,a,a,,"The application uses the networking stack to communicate the need to establish a TCP connection.

b. The payload section of the IP Datagram
c. The payload of the TCP segment
d. The header of the Ethernet frame
