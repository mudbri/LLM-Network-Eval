95,What are some benefits to using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Host configuration is simpler, since all hosts are visible from a single large Ethernet topology.
b. Forwarding on physical MAC addresses is simpler, since both the data center network topology and hosts' physical MAC addresses are hierarchical.
c. IP routing does not need to be reconfigured when physical or virtual machines move from one part of the network to another.
d. Scaling problems are simpler, since all hosts are configured on a single, flat topology.
e. Load balancing is easier on a layer-2 topology than on a layer 3 topology.
",,"a,c","a,b",,Using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center provides benefits such as simpler host configuration as all hosts are visible from a single large Ethernet topology (option a) and simpler forwarding based on physical MAC addresses due to the hierarchical structure of both the data center network topology and hosts' physical MAC addresses (option b).,[],0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,0.859036247985953
96,"In PortLand, what are the reasons for assigning hosts pseudo-MAC addresses, as opposed to simply forwarding traffic on physical MAC addresses? Select all that apply.","a. Hosts in the data-center network topology are more vulnerable to attack if they expose their actual physical MAC addresses, rather than having a layer of indirection.
b. It is very difficult to load balance traffic using physical MAC addresses; pseudo MAC addresses make it possible to assign traffic to destination IP addresses.
c. Without pseudo-MAC addresses, switches would have to update forwarding state whenever hosts with a particular MAC address moved from one portion of the topology to another.
d. Forwarding loops are be more common in a flat layer-2 topology than they are in a topology with hierarchical pseudo MAC addresses.
e. In a flat layer-2 topology, switches cannot know on which port to forward traffic without maintaining switch tables for each MAC address, since MAC addresses are flat, not hierarchical.
",,"c,e","a,c",,"a. Hosts in the data-center network topology are more vulnerable to attack if they expose their actual physical MAC addresses, rather than having a layer of indirection.

97,What are the steps involved in the Proxy ARP process that PortLand's Fabric Manager runs?,"a. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns returns PMAC directly to the end host.
b. Edge switch sends ARP query to fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch updates its local PMAC mapping table.
c. Host sends ARP query, fabric manager intercepts ARP query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to end host.
d. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to the host.
e. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch returns PMAC to end host.

98,"What are some of the disadvantages of today's interdomain routing protocol, BGP? Select all that apply.","a. ISPs cannot load-balance traffic across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix.
b. Routing and forwarding decisions are only based on IP prefix, not on a broader range of traffic flow attributes.
c. ISPs can only influence route selection through indirect mechanisms (e.g., prepending), rather than directly manipulating the forwarding table entries in switches.
d. ISPs cannot express preference of one route over another, given multiple routes to a destination.
e. ISPs can only influence the routing decisions of their immediate neighbor, not the entire end-to-end path.
",,"b,c,e","a,b,c,d,e",,"a. ISPs cannot load-balance traffic across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix because BGP does not support equal-cost multipath (ECMP) routing directly. b.

ISPs can only influence route selection through indirect mechanisms like AS path prepending, not by directly manipulating forwarding table entries in switches, which limits fine-grained control. d.
