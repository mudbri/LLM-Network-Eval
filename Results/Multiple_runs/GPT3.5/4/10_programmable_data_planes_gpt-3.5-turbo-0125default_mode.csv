117,Why does a RouteBricks server assign one core per queue?,"a. Having multiple cores accessing the same queue would require each core to perform only one function in the packet processing pipeline, which is inefficient.
b. Having multiple cores accessing the same queue would require locking to prevent concurrent memory accesses, slowing packet forwarding performance.
c. Having multiple cores accessing the same queue might create the possibility that there is a queue that is not served by any cores.
d. Cores have heterogeneous performance, and packets are different sizes, so it makes sense to assign less powerful cores to queues that have smaller packets.
",,b,b,,"Having multiple cores accessing the same queue would require locking to prevent concurrent memory accesses, slowing packet forwarding performance. In a multi-core system, when multiple cores access the same queue concurrently, there is a need for synchronization mechanisms like locks to prevent data corruption or race conditions. This synchronization overhead can slow down the packet processing performance.",['https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/routebricks-sosp09.pdf'],1,10_programmable_data_planes,0.9,0.9531712583626256
