32,What are some of the reasons that it is difficult to deploy improvements to BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. Changes are necessarily incremental because of the large installed base of routers that already run BGP.
b. BGP is implemented in hardware, so deploying changes to BGP requires changes on the timescale of hardware development cycles.
c. Deplyoing changes to BGP requires coordination across potentially tens of thousands of ASes in the Internet.
d. Only a few vendors implement BGP, and deploying changes requires convincing those vendors to change the protocol.
e. Deploying changes requires coordination in standards bodies such as the IETF.
",,"a,c,e","a,c,d",,"The reasons that make it difficult to deploy improvements to BGP include: a) Changes are necessarily incremental due to the large installed base of routers running BGP, making widespread immediate changes challenging. c) Deploying changes to BGP requires coordination across potentially tens of thousands of ASes (Autonomous Systems) in the Internet, which adds complexity and time to the process. d) Only a few vendors implement BGP, and convincing them to change the protocol can be a significant challenge, impacting the deployment of improvements.",[],0,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.9,0.5822596041934451
33,Which of the following are true about the RCP? Select all that apply.,"a. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, the RCP controller for an AS sees all routes for all destinations that an AS learns from neighboring ASes.
b. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, there is no need for ASes to use BGP to exchange routes.
c. In an RCP deployment, routers no longer have to compute routes.
d. The RCP controller operates just like a route reflector would, selecting a single best route for each destination for all client routers.
e. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, a single AS can benefit from deploying RCP even if no other ASes deploy RCP.
",,"c,e","a,b,e",,"a. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, the RCP controller for an AS sees all routes for all destinations that an AS learns from neighboring ASes. This is true as the RCP controller in Phase 1 has complete visibility of all routes learned by the AS from neighboring ASes. b. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, there is no need for ASes to use BGP to exchange routes. This is true because in RCP deployment, the RCP controller takes over the route computation and distribution tasks, eliminating the need for ASes to use BGP for route exchange. e. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, a single AS can benefit from deploying RCP even if no other ASes deploy RCP. This is true as even if other ASes do not deploy RCP, a single AS deploying RCP can still benefit from improved route computation and management within its own network.",['https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi14/nsdi14-paper-gember-jutla.pdf'],0,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.9,0.18770850119865165
34,"Which of the following are true about network management with BGP, in the absence of RCP? Select all that apply.","a. BGP's interaction with the underlying routing IGP routing protocol can result in persistent forwarding loops.
b. Implementing network-wide policy sometimes causes the routers themeselves to have to carry state.

d. BGP routing has a single point of failure.
e. It is not possible to perform traffic engineering with conventional BGP.

b. The second phase of RCP deployment offers potential benefits such as reduced routing table size.
c. In the second phase of deployment, the RCP controller sees all routes for every destination that neighboring ASes advertise.

e. In the second phase of RCP deployment, ASes do not need to use BGP to exchange routes with one another.
",,"b,c","b,c",,Option b is correct because the second phase of RCP deployment offers potential benefits such as reduced routing table size by allowing the RCP controller to see all routes for every destination that neighboring ASes advertise (Option c).
