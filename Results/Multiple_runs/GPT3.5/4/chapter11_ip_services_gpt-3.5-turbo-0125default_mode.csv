You are responsible to find out why users are not being able to reach the Internet.","a. The cause is not related to dynamic NAT
b. The command output does not provide any clue to identify the problem
c. Dynamic NAT can't use Standard ACLs
d. The NAT pool does not have enough entries to fulfill the user's requests
",,d,d,,"The issue seems to be related to the NAT pool not having enough entries to fulfill the user's requests. The output shows that all 10 addresses in the NAT pool have been allocated (allocated 10 (100%)), which means there are no more available addresses for new translations.",[],1,chapter11_ip_services,0.9,0.9965611191417935

Host A and host B attach to the same LAN and have correct default router settings per the FHRP configuration. Which of the following statements is true for this LAN?","a. You can't connect two routers to the same LAN subnet.
b. If one router fails, hosts can't send packets off-subnet
