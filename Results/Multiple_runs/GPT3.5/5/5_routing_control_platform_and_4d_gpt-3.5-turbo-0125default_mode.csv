32,What are some of the reasons that it is difficult to deploy improvements to BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. Changes are necessarily incremental because of the large installed base of routers that already run BGP.
b. BGP is implemented in hardware, so deploying changes to BGP requires changes on the timescale of hardware development cycles.
c. Deplyoing changes to BGP requires coordination across potentially tens of thousands of ASes in the Internet.
d. Only a few vendors implement BGP, and deploying changes requires convincing those vendors to change the protocol.
e. Deploying changes requires coordination in standards bodies such as the IETF.
",,"a,c,e","a,c,d",,"The reasons that make it difficult to deploy improvements to BGP include: a) Changes are necessarily incremental due to the large installed base of routers running BGP, making widespread immediate changes challenging. c) Deploying changes to BGP requires coordination across potentially tens of thousands of ASes (Autonomous Systems) in the Internet, which adds complexity and time to the deployment process. d) Since only a few vendors implement BGP, convincing these vendors to change the protocol to adopt improvements can be a slow and challenging process.",[],0,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.9,0.45572390746312563
33,Which of the following are true about the RCP? Select all that apply.,"a. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, the RCP controller for an AS sees all routes for all destinations that an AS learns from neighboring ASes.
b. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, there is no need for ASes to use BGP to exchange routes.
c. In an RCP deployment, routers no longer have to compute routes.
d. The RCP controller operates just like a route reflector would, selecting a single best route for each destination for all client routers.
e. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, a single AS can benefit from deploying RCP even if no other ASes deploy RCP.
",,"c,e","a,b,e",,"a. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, the RCP controller for an AS sees all routes for all destinations that an AS learns from neighboring ASes. This is true as the RCP controller needs to have a global view of all routes learned from neighboring ASes.
b. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, there is no need for ASes to use BGP to exchange routes. This is true because RCP takes over the route computation and distribution tasks, eliminating the need for BGP in Phase 1.
e. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, a single AS can benefit from deploying RCP even if no other ASes deploy RCP. This is true as even if other ASes do not deploy RCP, a single AS can still benefit from the simplification of route computation within its own network.",[],0,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.9,0.1757434768595165
34,"Which of the following are true about network management with BGP, in the absence of RCP? Select all that apply.","a. BGP's interaction with the underlying routing IGP routing protocol can result in persistent forwarding loops.
b. Implementing network-wide policy sometimes causes the routers themeselves to have to carry state.
c. Each router operates and makes decisions based only on a local view of network state.
d. BGP routing has a single point of failure.
e. It is not possible to perform traffic engineering with conventional BGP.
",,"a,b,c","b,c",,"Option b is correct because implementing network-wide policy in BGP can cause routers to carry state information that can lead to increased complexity and potential issues. Option c is correct because in BGP, each router operates independently based on its local view of network state without having a global view, which can lead to suboptimal routing decisions.",[],0,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.9,0.7525709761062647
35,Which of the following is true about the second phase of RCP deployment? Select all that apply.,"a. The second phase of RCP deployment requires no coordination with neighboring ASes.
b. The second phase of RCP deployment offers potential benefits such as reduced routing table size.
c. In the second phase of deployment, the RCP controller sees all routes for every destination that neighboring ASes advertise.
d. The second phase of deployment requires fewer BGP sessions at the RCP controller than the first phase, thus improving scalability of the controller.
e. In the second phase of RCP deployment, ASes do not need to use BGP to exchange routes with one another.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"Option b is correct because the second phase of RCP deployment offers benefits such as reduced routing table size by allowing the RCP controller to aggregate routes. Option c is also correct as in the second phase of deployment, the RCP controller sees all routes for every destination that neighboring ASes advertise.",[],1,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.9,0.8288463763679407

38,What are some examples of how a separate decision plane in the 4D architecture can amortize system overhead? Select all that apply.,"a.

c. Keeping track of topology information.
d. Performing route computation on behalf of all the routers in the AS.
