87,Which of the following reasons make programming OpenFlow switches difficult? Select all that apply.,"a. An OpenFlow controller only sees events for packets that the switches do not know how to handle.
b. OpenFlow networks require a single, centralized network controller.
c. Networks often have switches from multiple hardware vendors.
d. OpenFlow switches control switches at a low level of abstraction.
e. Network policies involve many independent tasks that may have conflicting behaviors.
",,"a,d,e","a,c,d,e",,"Programming OpenFlow switches can be challenging due to various reasons. 
- Option a is correct because OpenFlow switches only send events to the controller for packets they cannot handle, making it difficult to have a complete view of the network state. 
- Option c is correct as networks often consist of switches from different vendors, which can lead to interoperability issues. 
- Option d is valid because OpenFlow switches operate at a low level of abstraction, requiring detailed configuration and management. 
- Option e is accurate as network policies involve multiple independent tasks that may conflict, making it complex to ensure consistent behavior across the network.",[],0,12_programming_SDNs,0.9,0.5668170260636939
89,"Suppose that a network operator wants to express a policy that drops all traffic except for traffic from a specific IP prefix (i.e., group of IP addresses).  What problems exist with expressing this policy as a set of OpenFlow rules? Select all that apply.","a. Switches have limited room for flow table entries and cannot store rules for all IP addresses in a prefix by default.
b. The controller may see more than the first packet for a flow that it has already installed.
c. If the controller installs the rules in the wrong order, all traffic might be dropped, instead of allowing the permitted traffic.
d. If the operator starts adding more IP addresses that are permitted to send traffic, performance of the switch might suffer as the number of entries in the switch table grows.
e. Flow table entries can only perform exact matches on IP addresses, so installing rules that operate on groups of IP addresses will take many flow-table entries in the switch.
",,"a,b,c,d","a,d,e",,"a. Switches have limited room for flow table entries, so storing rules for all IP addresses in a prefix may not be feasible due to space constraints. d. As more IP addresses are added to the permitted list, the switch table grows, potentially affecting switch performance. e. Flow table entries in OpenFlow can only perform exact matches on IP addresses, making it challenging to express policies for groups of IP addresses efficiently.",['https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-resources/onf-specifications/openflow/'],0,12_programming_SDNs,0.9,0.9923761838884111
90,Which of the following have examples of sequential composition? Select all that apply.,"a. Block all port 80 traffic and count the number of packets that are blocked.
b. Load balance traffic based on whether the traffic matches a particular destination IP prefix.
c. Block all traffic except port 80 and count the number of packets that are blocked.
d. Block all traffic except port 80 traffic, and load balance port 80 traffic across three destination IP addresses.
e. Block all traffic except port 80 and count the number of packets that are not blocked.
",,"b,d,e","c,e",,"Sequential composition refers to a sequence of operations where the output of one operation becomes the input of the next operation.

91,Which of the following have examples of parallel composition? Select all that apply.,"a. Perform load balancing on any traffic that arrives from prefix 130.207.0.0/16 or is destined to port 80.
b. Perform MAC learning on all traffic that is not blocked by a firewall rule.
c. Count all port 80 traffic.
d. Block all traffic whose source IP address is contained in a list of blocked IP addresses.
e. Load balance traffic across multiple destination IP addresses and perform routing to the resulting destination IP addresses.
",,"a,c,d","a,e",,"Options a and e involve examples of parallel composition in Software Defined Networking. Parallel composition refers to the ability to perform multiple operations concurrently or in parallel. In option a, performing load balancing on traffic from a specific prefix or destined to a specific port can happen simultaneously.

92,Which of the following is the appropriate Pyretic rule for matching traffic that sends packets from either 10.0.0.1 or 10.0.0.2 to IP address 1.2.3.4?,"a. (match(srcip=10.0.0.1) >> match(srcip=10.0.0.2)) + mod(dstip=1.2.3.4)

",,c,c,,The correct Pyretic rule for matching traffic that sends packets from either 10.0.0.1 or 10.0.0.2 to IP address 1.2.3.4 is to use the logical OR operator (+) between the two source IP matches and then use the logical AND operator (>>) between the combined source IP match and the modification of the destination IP address.,[],1,12_programming_SDNs,0.9,0.8323349375495701

",,b,b,,"Option b is the correct choice. In Pyretic, the '>>' operator is used for sequencing, which means the second rule is applied after the first rule.

b. Drop all traffic arriving from source IP addresses in prefix 10.0.0.0/8.
