43,Which of the following statements are true about the OpenFlow specification? Select all that apply.,"a. If a switch does not contain a flow table entry that matches a particular packet, the switch forwards the packet to the controller for handling.
b. The main purpose of the OpenFlow control channel is to update flow table entries on switches.
c. The OpenFlow specification provides mechanisms to perform Layer 2 learning across a network of switches.
d. Once a switch has sent one packet for a flow, it must also send all subsequent packets for that flow to the controller.
e. Some versions of the OpenFlow specification allow for performing more than one action on a single packet.
",,"a,b,e","a,b,e",,"a. Correct - If a switch does not have a matching flow table entry, it can forward the packet to the controller for instructions.
b. Correct - The primary purpose of the OpenFlow control channel is to update flow table entries on switches.
e. Correct - Certain versions of the OpenFlow specification support performing multiple actions on a single packet.",[],1,6_control_plane,0.9,0.9686760674479409

",,"b,e","b,e",,"Option b is correct because dpctl can indeed modify flow table entries on an OpenFlow switch. Option e is also correct as dpctl can inspect flow table entries on an OpenFlow switch. The other options are incorrect: a) dpctl is not invoked from within the Mininet emulator, c) dpctl does not respond to network events like packets sent from a switch, and d) dpctl is not an OpenFlow controller.",[],1,6_control_plane,0.9,0.7312959652134664

b. Support for and integration with cloud applications.
c. Ease of learning curve.
d. Need for production-quality operation.
e. Speed of prototyping.
",,"a,b,c,d,e","a,c,d",,The considerations for the choice of controller should include: a) Performance of the programming language that the controller is implemented in - as it can impact the overall performance of the SDN network; c) Ease of learning curve - to ensure that administrators can quickly adapt and manage the network effectively; d) Need for production-quality operation - to guarantee stability and reliability of the network in a live environment.,[],0,6_control_plane,0.9,0.4456068221622728
46,Which of the following controllers support OpenStack integration? Select all that apply.,"a. NOX
b. Pox
c. CpQD
d. Floodlight
e. Ryu
",,"d,e","c,d,e",,"The controllers CpQD, Floodlight, and Ryu support OpenStack integration. CpQD is an SDN controller developed by CPqD in Brazil, which has been integrated with OpenStack.

Ryu is another open-source SDN controller that can be integrated with OpenStack.",[],0,6_control_plane,0.9,0.43736429244503305
47,Which of the following are true about Pox? Select all that apply.,"a. Pox automatically determines the order to install flow table rules, to avoid inconsistent forwarding behavior.
b. Pox's _handle_PacketIn function determines how a packet should be handled when it arrives at the controller.
c. Pox provides a function to modify flow table entries at a switch.
d. Pox's performance is typically slower than NOX.
e. Pox automatically determines the priority between two conflicting rules.
",,"b,c,d","b,c",,Option b is correct because Pox's _handle_PacketIn function is responsible for determining how a packet should be handled when it arrives at the controller. Option c is also correct as Pox does provide a function to modify flow table entries at a switch.,[],0,6_control_plane,0.9,0.9954410223861514
48,What is the difference between a hard timeout and an idle timeout?,"a. A hard timeout occurs exactly at the specified interval, whereas an idle timeout may occur slightly later than the specified interval.
b. A hard timeout expunges a flow table entry regardless of whether there have been active matches, whereas an idle timeout expunges the flow table entry only if there have been no matches for that flow within the specified interval.
c. A hard timeout expunges all flow table entry from the switch, whereas an idle timeout only expunges one flow at a time.
d. A hard timeout expunges a flow table entry for all switches in the network, whereas an idle timeout only expunges the flow table entry on the switches that have seen no matches for that flow within the specified interval.
",,b,b,,"A hard timeout expunges a flow table entry regardless of whether there have been active matches, whereas an idle timeout expunges the flow table entry only if there have been no matches for that flow within the specified interval. This means that a hard timeout is based on a fixed time interval, while an idle timeout is based on the absence of activity for a specific flow.",['https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7426'],1,6_control_plane,0.9,0.996343686053952
49,Which of the following are true about hubs and learning switches? Select all that apply,"a. A hub implemented in Pox requires all incoming packets to be directed to the controller.
b. A learning switch requires more logic at the controller (in terms of lines of code in Pox) than a hub.
c. A learning switch implemented in Pox can be easily extended to support firewall capabilities.
d. A learning switch implemented in Pox requires all incoming packets to be redirected to the controller.
e. A hub forwards an incoming packet on all ports (except the incoming port), whereas a switch only floods an incoming packet on all ports if it does not have a table entry that determines the output port for that packet.
",,"b,c,e","b,e",,"Option b is correct because a learning switch requires more logic at the controller compared to a hub due to the additional functionality of learning and updating the forwarding table. Option e is correct because a hub forwards incoming packets on all ports except the incoming port, whereas a switch only floods an incoming packet on all ports if it does not have a table entry for that packet.",[],0,6_control_plane,0.9,0.40689711939195766

b. action
c. redirect
d. drop
e. forward
",,"a,b","a,b",,"The two key steps of an OpenFlow flow table entry are matching and action. Matching involves comparing incoming packets against the flow table entry to determine if there is a match.
