62,Which of the following are true of “network slicing”? Select all that apply.,"a. Network operators can use slicing to test configurations on “shadow” networks that mirror a production network topology.
b. One way to slice networks is according to “flow space”, whereby different controllers might control distinct and non-overlapping traffic flows.
c. A controller can prevent one network slice from interfering with the resources of another.
d. Multi-tenant datacenters are one use case for network slicing.
e. Conventional (i.e., non-SDN) networks have no concept of network virtualization or slicing.
",,"a,b,d","b,c,d",,Option b is correct because slicing networks according to flow space allows for different controllers to manage separate and non-overlapping traffic flows efficiently. Option c is true as a controller in network slicing can ensure that one slice does not impact the resources or performance of another slice. Option d is also accurate as multi-tenant datacenters benefit from network slicing to provide isolated and customized network services to different tenants.,[],0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,0.5900238278319638
63,Which of the following are true about flow spaces? Select all that apply.,"a. Two flow spaces cannot overlap.
b. One host could send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces.
c. Flow spaces can only be defined according to combinations of packet header fields.
d. Flowspace isolation separates individual virtual networks from one another but incurs some performance penalty for doing so.
e. Two controllers that write data-plane rules for non-overlapping parts of flowspace can never cause traffic from one “slice” to enter the other slice.

64,Which of the following describe the control-plane checks that FlowVisor implements? Select all that apply.,"a. When a packet must be forwarded to a controller, Flowvisor forwards traffic to the correct controller based on which controller “owns” the flowspace corresponding to that packet.
b. Flowvisor prevents each slice's controller from being the target of a denial of service attack from other slices.
c. Flowvisor can only instantiate network slices based on the network topology, not based on other properties, such as application traffic.
d. Flowvisor prevents a controller from writing data-plane rules to a part of flowspace that it does not own.
e. Flowvisor installs traffic shaping and quality of service rules to ensure that each network slice has guaranteed resources.
",,"a,d","a,b,d",,"FlowVisor implements the following control-plane checks: 
a. When a packet must be forwarded to a controller, Flowvisor forwards traffic to the correct controller based on which controller 'owns' the flowspace corresponding to that packet. This ensures proper handling of packets by the respective controllers. 
b. Flowvisor prevents each slice's controller from being the target of a denial of service attack from other slices. This security measure helps in maintaining the stability and integrity of the network slices. 
d. Flowvisor prevents a controller from writing data-plane rules to a part of flowspace that it does not own. This restriction ensures that controllers operate within their designated flowspace boundaries, enhancing network segmentation and control.",[],0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,0.9879711879533746
65,Which of the following are applications in a home network that network slicing could enable? Select all that apply.,"a. Quality of service for certain applications (e.g., video streaming)

70,What best describes the relationship between network virtualization and SDN? Select all that apply.,"a. SDN controllers can help manage storage and data facilities, in addition to network configuration
b. SDN predates network virtualization
c. Network virtualization requires SDN
d. SDN makes some aspects of network virtualization easier to manage
e. Network virtualization enables SDN
",,"a,d","c,d",,"Network virtualization and SDN are closely related concepts, where network virtualization is a key component enabled by SDN. SDN provides the programmability and control necessary for network virtualization to create multiple virtual networks on a single physical network infrastructure. Therefore, network virtualization requires SDN to function effectively.
