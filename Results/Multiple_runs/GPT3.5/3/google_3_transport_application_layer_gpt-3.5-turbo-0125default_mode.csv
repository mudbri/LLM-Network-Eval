36,What ordering of TCP flags make up the Three-Way Handshake?,"a. SYN, ACK, FIN
b. SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK
c. FIN, FIN/ACK, ACK
d. SYN, ACK, SYN, ACK
",,b,b,,"The correct ordering of TCP flags in the Three-Way Handshake is SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK. In this process, the client sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server, the server responds with a SYN/ACK (synchronize-acknowledgment) packet, and finally, the client sends an ACK (acknowledgment) packet to complete the connection establishment.",['https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-3-way-handshake-process/'],1,google_3_transport_application_layer,0.95,0.9999987335551019
37,"Transport layer protocols, like TCP and UDP, introduce the concept of a port. How many bits are in a port field?","a. 16
b. 4
c. 32
d. 8
",,a,a,,"The port field in TCP and UDP headers is 16 bits long. This allows for a total of 2^16 (65,536) possible port numbers, which are used to differentiate between different applications or services running on a single device.","['https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc768', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793']",1,google_3_transport_application_layer,0.9,0.9999331737729718
38,A device that blocks traffic that meets certain criteria is known as a ________.,"a. Hub
b. Router
c. Switch
d. Firewall
",,d,d,,A device that blocks traffic based on certain criteria is known as a firewall. Firewalls are network security devices that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.,['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/firewalls/what-is-a-firewall.html'],1,google_3_transport_application_layer,0.9,0.9999995679800934
39,Which TCP flag is used to make the listening program respond immediately?,"a. ACK
b. PSH
c. URG
d. RST
",,b,b,,"The TCP flag used to make the listening program respond immediately is the PSH (Push) flag. When the PSH flag is set in a TCP segment, it indicates to the receiving end to deliver the data to the application immediately without buffering.",['https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-network-tcp-flags/'],1,google_3_transport_application_layer,0.9,0.6015730527415961
40,_________are identified as ports 49152 through 65535.,"a. User ports
b. Ephemeral ports
c. Sockets
d. System ports
",,b,b,,Ports 49152 through 65535 are known as ephemeral ports. These ports are used as temporary ports for outbound connections by the operating system.,[],1,google_3_transport_application_layer,0.9,0.9999924157887603
41,"Unlike our five-layer model, the OSI network model adds two more layers on top of the Application Layer. Select examples of these new layers below.","a. The compression layer
b. The session layer
c. The interconnection layer
d. The presentation layer
",,"b,d",b,,The OSI network model adds two more layers on top of the Application Layer: the Presentation Layer and the Session Layer. The Session Layer manages communication sessions between computers.,['https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/layers-of-osi-model/'],0,google_3_transport_application_layer,0.9,0.999995276659155
42,An example of something that operates at the application layer is:,"a. UDP
b. A router
c. TCP
d. A web browser
",,d,d,,A web browser operates at the application layer of the OSI model. It is responsible for interacting with websites and displaying web content to users.,[],1,google_3_transport_application_layer,0.9,0.9999998063873687
44,Which part of the operating system does the application use to communicate the need to establish a TCP connection?,"a. Networking stack
b. ARP message
c. The source port
d. The router
",,a,a,,"The application uses the networking stack to communicate the need to establish a TCP connection. The networking stack is responsible for handling communication protocols, including TCP/IP, and manages network communication tasks for applications.",[],1,google_3_transport_application_layer,0.9,0.9997752702855062
45,Which of the following sections of the TCP/IP Five-Layer Network Model contain the data the application wants to send? Select all that apply.,"a. The payload section of the Ethernet frame
b. The payload section of the IP Datagram
c. The payload of the TCP segment
d. The header of the Ethernet frame
",,"a,b,c",c,,The data that the application wants to send is contained in the payload of the TCP segment. The TCP segment encapsulates the application data and adds TCP header information for reliable delivery.,['https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-model/'],0,google_3_transport_application_layer,0.9,0.9547815272023744
