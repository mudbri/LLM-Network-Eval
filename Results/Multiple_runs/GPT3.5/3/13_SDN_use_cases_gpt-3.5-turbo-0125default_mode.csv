95,What are some benefits to using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Host configuration is simpler, since all hosts are visible from a single large Ethernet topology.
b. Forwarding on physical MAC addresses is simpler, since both the data center network topology and hosts' physical MAC addresses are hierarchical.
c. IP routing does not need to be reconfigured when physical or virtual machines move from one part of the network to another.
d. Scaling problems are simpler, since all hosts are configured on a single, flat topology.
e. Load balancing is easier on a layer-2 topology than on a layer 3 topology.
",,"a,c","a,b",,Options a and b are correct. Using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center simplifies host configuration as all hosts are visible from a single large Ethernet topology (a). Forwarding on physical MAC addresses is also simpler because both the data center network topology and hosts' physical MAC addresses are hierarchical (b). The other options do not accurately represent the benefits of using a layer-2 MAC topology.,[],0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,0.822260072552634
96,"In PortLand, what are the reasons for assigning hosts pseudo-MAC addresses, as opposed to simply forwarding traffic on physical MAC addresses? Select all that apply.","a. Hosts in the data-center network topology are more vulnerable to attack if they expose their actual physical MAC addresses, rather than having a layer of indirection.
b. It is very difficult to load balance traffic using physical MAC addresses; pseudo MAC addresses make it possible to assign traffic to destination IP addresses.
c. Without pseudo-MAC addresses, switches would have to update forwarding state whenever hosts with a particular MAC address moved from one portion of the topology to another.
d. Forwarding loops are be more common in a flat layer-2 topology than they are in a topology with hierarchical pseudo MAC addresses.
e. In a flat layer-2 topology, switches cannot know on which port to forward traffic without maintaining switch tables for each MAC address, since MAC addresses are flat, not hierarchical.
",,"c,e","a,c",,"a. Hosts in the data-center network topology are more vulnerable to attack if they expose their actual physical MAC addresses, rather than having a layer of indirection. Assigning pseudo-MAC addresses adds a layer of security by not revealing the actual MAC addresses of hosts. c. Without pseudo-MAC addresses, switches would have to update forwarding state whenever hosts with a particular MAC address moved from one portion of the topology to another. Pseudo-MAC addresses provide a level of abstraction that avoids frequent updates in the forwarding state when hosts move within the network.",[],0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,0.9724484700388335
97,What are the steps involved in the Proxy ARP process that PortLand's Fabric Manager runs?,"a. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns returns PMAC directly to the end host.
b. Edge switch sends ARP query to fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch updates its local PMAC mapping table.
c. Host sends ARP query, fabric manager intercepts ARP query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to end host.
d. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to the host.
e. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch returns PMAC to end host.

98,"What are some of the disadvantages of today's interdomain routing protocol, BGP? Select all that apply.","a. ISPs cannot load-balance traffic across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix.
b. Routing and forwarding decisions are only based on IP prefix, not on a broader range of traffic flow attributes.
c. ISPs can only influence route selection through indirect mechanisms (e.g., prepending), rather than directly manipulating the forwarding table entries in switches.
d. ISPs cannot express preference of one route over another, given multiple routes to a destination.
e. ISPs can only influence the routing decisions of their immediate neighbor, not the entire end-to-end path.
",,"b,c,e","a,b,c,d,e",,"All of the given options are disadvantages of BGP. 
a. ISPs cannot load-balance traffic across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix because BGP selects only a single best path based on its attributes. 
b. Routing and forwarding decisions in BGP are primarily based on the destination IP prefix and not on other traffic flow attributes, limiting the granularity of control. 
c. ISPs can only influence route selection through indirect mechanisms like AS path prepending, rather than directly manipulating forwarding table entries in switches, which limits control. 
d. BGP does not inherently provide a way for ISPs to express a preference for one route over another when multiple routes to the same destination exist. 
e. BGP influences routing decisions only with directly connected neighbors, not the entire end-to-end path, which can limit control over the entire route.",[],0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,0.4863480350364981
101,What are some of the features that an SDX enables that today's IXPs cannot support? Select all that apply.,"a. Application of different business relationships across different regions of the world (e.g., peering only in a specific geographic region).
b. Application-specific peering
c. Wide-area load balancing using DNS-based redirection
d. On-the-fly redirection to middleboxes
e. Wide-area load balancing using IP packet rewriting
",,"b,d,e","b,d,e",,"SDX (Software Defined Exchange) enables features that traditional IXPs (Internet Exchange Points) cannot support. Application-specific peering (option b) allows for tailored peering agreements based on specific applications or services. On-the-fly redirection to middleboxes (option d) is a capability of SDX to redirect traffic to specialized middleboxes for functions like security, caching, or deep packet inspection. Wide-area load balancing using IP packet rewriting (option e) is another feature that SDX can provide, which involves rewriting IP packet headers for load balancing purposes.",[],1,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,0.46725785408705967
103,What are some of the motivations for applying software defined networking in home networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Better performance, since control decisions can be made from a well-provisioned server, as opposed to an under-provisioned router.
b. Ability to better user interfaces to control home network behavior, independent of the interfaces that ship with home router devices.
c. Ability to allow multiple service providers access to the home network infrastructure for different applications and services.
d. Outsourcing control and management of the home network to a third party.
e. More fine-grained control over the forwarding behavior of individual devices as conditions in the network change (e.g., a device uses too much bandwidth or data).

104,"Suppose that an operator of a home network wants to write the following policy:
1. Block all traffic to Facebook from my child's computer.
2. Rate limit BitTorrent traffic from my child's computer if the VoIP client on my desktop is active.
Which of the following most closely approximates the policy?
