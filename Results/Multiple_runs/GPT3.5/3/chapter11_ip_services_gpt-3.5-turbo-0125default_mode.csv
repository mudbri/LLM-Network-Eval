194,"Examine the following show command output on a router configured for dynamic NAT:
""â€” Inside Source
access-list 1 pool examsdigest
pool examsdigest: netmask 255.255.255.240

You are responsible to find out why users are not being able to reach the Internet.","a. The cause is not related to dynamic NAT
b. The command output does not provide any clue to identify the problem
c. Dynamic NAT can't use Standard ACLs
d. The NAT pool does not have enough entries to fulfill the user's requests
",,d,d,,"The output shows that all 10 addresses in the NAT pool have been allocated (100%), which means there are no more available addresses for new translations. This lack of available addresses in the NAT pool is likely the reason why users are unable to reach the Internet.",[],1,chapter11_ip_services,0.9,0.9941806305097851

198,One of the features of SNMPv3 is called message integrity.,"a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",,a,a,,The statement is TRUE. SNMPv3 provides message integrity to ensure that the data has not been tampered with during transmission. This is achieved through the use of hashing algorithms like MD5 or SHA.,['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/snmp/configuration/xe-16-5/snmp-xe-16-5-book/snmp-v3.html'],1,chapter11_ip_services,0.9,0.9999988527586581

201,"R1 and R2 are attached to the same Ethernet VLAN, with subnet 192.168.1.0/24, and addresses 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2 respectively. The routers use an FHRP. Host A and host B attach to the same LAN and have correct default router settings per the FHRP configuration. Which of the following statements is true for this LAN?","a. You can't connect two routers to the same LAN subnet.
b. If one router fails, hosts can't send packets off-subnet
c. If one router fails, both hosts will use the one remaining router as a default router
d. if one router fails, only one of the two hosts will still be able to send packets off-subnet
",,c,c,,"In this scenario, R1 and R2 are configured with an FHRP (First Hop Redundancy Protocol) such as HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) or VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol).

d. Delay
e. CoS
f. Jitter
",,"a,c,d,f","a,b,c,d,e,f",,"Quality of Service (QoS) can manage various characteristics of network traffic including: 
a. Bandwidth: QoS can prioritize and allocate bandwidth to different types of traffic. 
b. LLQ (Low Latency Queuing): QoS mechanism that provides strict priority queuing for delay-sensitive data like voice and video. 
c. Loss: QoS can help mitigate packet loss by prioritizing critical traffic. 
d. Delay: QoS can manage and reduce delays for time-sensitive applications.
