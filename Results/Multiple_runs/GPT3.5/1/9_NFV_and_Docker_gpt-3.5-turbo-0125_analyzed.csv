72,"In NFV, which of the following is the function of steering?","a. Finding the best location to place a single network function in an enterprise or wide area network.
b. Installing custom packet processing code on servers in the network.
c. Placing middleboxes at places throughout the network to minimize network load.
d. Installing custom packet processing code on switches in the network.
e. Installing flow table entries in switches to forward traffic through network functions or middleboxes that are installed in the network
",,e,a,,The function of steering in NFV involves finding the best location to place a single network function in an enterprise or wide area network. This process helps in optimizing the network by determining the most suitable location for specific network functions to improve efficiency and performance.,[],0,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.9,0.971209822452679,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,Doesnâ€™t know what steering does,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0.0,,,,,1.0,1.0,Not knowing what steering means,0.0,NFV,misinformation,Minor,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,0.1999999999999999
74,What are some advantages of Docker containers over virtual machines? Select all that apply.,"a. Containers can be connected to build a virtual network, whereas virtual machines cannot.
b. Performance in containers may be better since they invoke OS system calls directly, rather than through an emulated machine.
c. Containers require less storage and memory per-instance, and require less time to instantiate than virtual machines.
d. Containers provide more flexibility in the choice of operating system.
e. Containers provide better isolation than virtual machines.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"Option b is correct because containers have better performance compared to virtual machines as they invoke OS system calls directly without the need for emulation. Option c is also correct as containers require less storage, memory per-instance, and time to instantiate than virtual machines.",['https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container'],1,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.9,0.999992341380677,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0
75,Which of the following commands is used to instantiate a new Docker container by invoking a command in that container?,"a. docker stop
b. docker attach
c. docker commit
d. docker pull
e. docker run
",,e,e,,The correct command to instantiate a new Docker container by invoking a command in that container is the 'docker run' command. This command creates and starts a new container based on the specified image and can also run a specific command inside the container at the time of creation.,['https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/'],1,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.95,0.999996230284605,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0
76,Which of the following is true about networking Docker containers? Select all that apply.,"a. Docker containers can be networked to each other via the native Docker bridge or Open vSwitch.
b. A Docker container can never expose a low port (e.g., port 80) to the external Internet; Internet hosts must always reach a Docker service by a high port (e.g., 8080).
c. Docker containers running in different virtual machines cannot be networked together.
d. Connecting Docker containers requires setting up GRE tunnels between the containers.
e. Docker containers are not reachable from the external Internet by default.",,"a,e","a,e",,"a. Docker containers can be networked to each other via the native Docker bridge or Open vSwitch: This is true. Docker provides networking capabilities through the Docker bridge network or third-party solutions like Open vSwitch. These options allow containers to communicate with each other.
e. Docker containers are not reachable from the external Internet by default: This statement is generally true. By default, Docker containers are isolated from external networks for security reasons. To make a container reachable from the external Internet, specific networking configurations need to be implemented.",['https://docs.docker.com/network/'],1,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.9,0.999896506964074,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0
