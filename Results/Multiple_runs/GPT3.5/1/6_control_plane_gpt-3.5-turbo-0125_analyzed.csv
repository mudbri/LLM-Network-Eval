43,Which of the following statements are true about the OpenFlow specification? Select all that apply.,"a. If a switch does not contain a flow table entry that matches a particular packet, the switch forwards the packet to the controller for handling.

c. The OpenFlow specification provides mechanisms to perform Layer 2 learning across a network of switches.
