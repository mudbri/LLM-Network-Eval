5,Which of the following are not true about packet switching? Select all that apply.,"a. Once a connection is established between two endpoints in a packet switched network, the end-to-end route cannot change, or the connection must be re-established.
b. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will always experience predictable latency.

6,Which of the following are true about content distribution networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Content distribution networks can improve the performance that a client sees by reducing the network latency between the client and the content that it is downloading.
b. Content distribution networks can reduce transit expenses for a content provider by enabling much of the provider’s content to be served from a nearby network, sometimes even from a cache that is within the client’s own network.
c. Real-time content such as video streams cannot be distributed from a content distribution network.
d. Content distribution networks typically redirect Web clients to a nearby Web cache by rewriting the IP address of packets sent from the client to the IP address of the nearby Web cache.
",,"a,b","a,b",,"a. Content distribution networks can improve performance for clients by reducing network latency through caching content closer to the end-users, which helps in faster content delivery.

7,Which of the following are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control? Select all that apply.,"a. Only wireless networks can have collisions at the receiver; such collisions are not possible on wired Ethernet networks.
b. Using RTS/CTS (“request to send”, “clear to send”) control reduces the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network.
c. A wireless sender can avoid causing a collision at the receiver by performing a “carrier sense” to determine whether any other sender wants to transmit at the time that it wishes to send a packet.
d. Disabling RTS/CTS necessarily lowers the effective throughput of the wireless network, since more collisions will occur at the receiver without RTS/CTS enabled.
",,b,c,,"Option c is correct. In 802.11 wireless medium access control, a wireless sender can indeed avoid causing a collision at the receiver by performing a 'carrier sense' to check if any other sender wants to transmit at that time. This process helps in reducing collisions and improving efficiency in wireless communication. Options a, b, and d are incorrect. Option a is false as collisions can occur in both wired and wireless networks. Option b is false because while RTS/CTS adds some overhead, it helps in reducing collisions and can improve throughput in certain scenarios. Option d is also false because disabling RTS/CTS does not necessarily lead to lower throughput; it depends on the network environment and traffic patterns.",['https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/carrier-sense.htm'],0,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.992255297457256,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,"The subtle confusion in this question was the description of the choice.

8,Which of the following are true about video streaming? Select all that apply.,"a. Using UDP to stream a video instead of TCP is appropriate if the client is more concerned about low delay and interactivity than it does about receiving a high-quality stream.
b. A larger playout buffer at the client allows the client more time to recover from lost packets.
c. Using TCP for video streaming could result in larger delays between transmission and playout than streaming the same video with UDP.
d. Since UDP provides no reliable delivery guarantees, a video streaming application that uses UDP as its transport cannot recover from any packet loss in the video stream.
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"a. Using UDP for video streaming is appropriate when low delay and interactivity are more critical than receiving a high-quality stream because UDP's lack of congestion control and error recovery mechanisms can lead to faster transmission but with the possibility of packet loss.
 b. A larger playout buffer at the client helps in recovering from lost packets by providing additional time for retransmissions or error concealment techniques, improving the overall quality of the stream.
 c. TCP, due to its congestion control mechanisms and retransmission of lost packets, can lead to larger delays between transmission and playout compared to UDP, which prioritizes speed over reliability in real-time applications like video streaming.","['https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc793.txt', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5405']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.971812299188672,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0
9,Which of the following are true about TCP? Select all that apply.,"a. TCP guarantees that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted.
b. A TCP sender and receiver use a “three-way handshake” both to set up and to terminate the TCP connection.
c. TCP’s congestion avoidance algorithm causes the sender to reduce its sending rate by a factor of two when it sees a packet loss.
d. A TCP sender controls its sending rate by adjusting the number of unacknowledged packets that can be sent over the network at any time.

b. If every network on the Internet performed stateless egress filtering to defend against source IP address spoofing, the DNS reflection attack could not be carried out.
c. In a “SYN Flood” attack, each TCP SYN packet that a victim receives causes it to set up TCP connection state.

",,"b,c,d","a,d",,"a. If every network on the Internet performed stateless ingress filtering to defend against source IP spoofing, the DNS reflection attack would not work: This statement is true. In a DNS reflection attack, the attacker spoofs the source IP address, making it appear as if the DNS request is coming from the victim's IP address.
