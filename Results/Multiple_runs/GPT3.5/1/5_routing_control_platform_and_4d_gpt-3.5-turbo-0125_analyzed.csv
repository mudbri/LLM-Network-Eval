32,What are some of the reasons that it is difficult to deploy improvements to BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. Changes are necessarily incremental because of the large installed base of routers that already run BGP.
b. BGP is implemented in hardware, so deploying changes to BGP requires changes on the timescale of hardware development cycles.
c. Deplyoing changes to BGP requires coordination across potentially tens of thousands of ASes in the Internet.
d. Only a few vendors implement BGP, and deploying changes requires convincing those vendors to change the protocol.
e. Deploying changes requires coordination in standards bodies such as the IETF.
",,"a,c,e","a,c,e",,"a. Changes are necessarily incremental because of the large installed base of routers that already run BGP: BGP has a vast installed base, and any changes need to be backward compatible to ensure smooth transitions.
c. Deploying changes to BGP requires coordination across potentially tens of thousands of ASes in the Internet: BGP operates across numerous Autonomous Systems (ASes), making it challenging to coordinate changes across all these entities.
