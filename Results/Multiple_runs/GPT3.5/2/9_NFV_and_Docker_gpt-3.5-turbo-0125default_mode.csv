72,"In NFV, which of the following is the function of steering?","a. Finding the best location to place a single network function in an enterprise or wide area network.
b. Installing custom packet processing code on servers in the network.
c. Placing middleboxes at places throughout the network to minimize network load.
d. Installing custom packet processing code on switches in the network.
e. Installing flow table entries in switches to forward traffic through network functions or middleboxes that are installed in the network
",,e,a,,"In NFV (Network Function Virtualization), the function of steering involves finding the best location to place a single network function in an enterprise or wide area network. This process helps optimize the network's performance by strategically placing network functions where they can be most effective.",[],0,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.9,0.9637236814114236
74,What are some advantages of Docker containers over virtual machines? Select all that apply.,"a. Containers can be connected to build a virtual network, whereas virtual machines cannot.
b. Performance in containers may be better since they invoke OS system calls directly, rather than through an emulated machine.
c. Containers require less storage and memory per-instance, and require less time to instantiate than virtual machines.
d. Containers provide more flexibility in the choice of operating system.
e. Containers provide better isolation than virtual machines.

Containers share the host OS kernel, which can lead to better performance compared to virtual machines.', 'c': 'Containers require less storage and memory per-instance, and require less time to instantiate than virtual machines. This efficiency is due to containers not needing a full OS per instance like virtual machines.', 'e': 'Containers provide better isolation than virtual machines. While virtual machines have their own OS, containers share the host OS kernel but still provide isolation through namespaces and control groups.'}",['https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container'],0,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.9,0.9981342788395638
75,Which of the following commands is used to instantiate a new Docker container by invoking a command in that container?,"a. docker stop
b. docker attach
c. docker commit
d. docker pull
e. docker run
",,e,e,,The correct command to instantiate a new Docker container by invoking a command in that container is 'docker run'. This command creates and starts a new container based on the specified image and allows you to run a specific command inside that container.,['https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/'],1,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.95,0.9999975415208221
76,Which of the following is true about networking Docker containers? Select all that apply.,"a. Docker containers can be networked to each other via the native Docker bridge or Open vSwitch.
b. A Docker container can never expose a low port (e.g., port 80) to the external Internet; Internet hosts must always reach a Docker service by a high port (e.g., 8080).
c. Docker containers running in different virtual machines cannot be networked together.
d. Connecting Docker containers requires setting up GRE tunnels between the containers.
e. Docker containers are not reachable from the external Internet by default.
",,"a,e","a,e",,Option a is correct because Docker containers can be networked to each other using the native Docker bridge or Open vSwitch. Option e is also correct as Docker containers are not reachable from the external Internet by default due to their isolated nature.,['https://docs.docker.com/network/'],1,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.9,0.9997975977265046
