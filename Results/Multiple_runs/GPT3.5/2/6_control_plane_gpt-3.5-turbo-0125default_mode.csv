43,Which of the following statements are true about the OpenFlow specification? Select all that apply.,"a. If a switch does not contain a flow table entry that matches a particular packet, the switch forwards the packet to the controller for handling.
b. The main purpose of the OpenFlow control channel is to update flow table entries on switches.
c. The OpenFlow specification provides mechanisms to perform Layer 2 learning across a network of switches.
d. Once a switch has sent one packet for a flow, it must also send all subsequent packets for that flow to the controller.
e. Some versions of the OpenFlow specification allow for performing more than one action on a single packet.
",,"a,b,e","a,b,e",,"a. If a switch does not contain a flow table entry that matches a particular packet, the switch forwards the packet to the controller for handling. This is true as per the OpenFlow specification. b. The main purpose of the OpenFlow control channel is to update flow table entries on switches. This is correct as the control channel is used to communicate between the controller and the switches to update flow table entries. e. Some versions of the OpenFlow specification allow for performing more than one action on a single packet. This statement is true as certain OpenFlow versions support multiple actions on a single packet.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-resources/onf-specifications/openflow/', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7426']",1,6_control_plane,0.9,0.9697043257556623
44,Which of the following statements are true about dpctl? Select all that apply.,"a. dpctl is invoked from within the Mininet emulator.

d. dpctl is an OpenFlow controller.
e. dpctl can inspect flow table entries on an OpenFlow switch.
",,"b,e","b,e",,"Option b is correct because dpctl can indeed modify flow table entries on an OpenFlow switch. Option e is also correct as dpctl can inspect flow table entries on an OpenFlow switch. The other options are incorrect: a) dpctl is not invoked from within the Mininet emulator, c) dpctl does not respond to network events like packets sent from a switch, and d) dpctl is not an OpenFlow controller.",[],1,6_control_plane,0.9,0.6713199057078485
45,Which of the following are reasonable considerations for the choice of controller? Select all that apply.,"a. Performance of the programming language that the controller is implemented in.
b. Support for and integration with cloud applications.
c. Ease of learning curve.
d. Need for production-quality operation.
e. Speed of prototyping.
",,"a,b,c,d,e","a,c,d",,The considerations for the choice of controller should include: a) Performance of the programming language that the controller is implemented in - as it can impact the overall performance of the SDN network; c) Ease of learning curve - to ensure that administrators can quickly adapt and manage the network effectively; d) Need for production-quality operation - to guarantee stability and reliability of the network in a live environment.,[],0,6_control_plane,0.9,0.5285132566610012
46,Which of the following controllers support OpenStack integration? Select all that apply.,"a. NOX
b. Pox
c. CpQD
d. Floodlight
e. Ryu
",,"d,e","c,d,e",,"The controllers CpQD, Floodlight, and Ryu support OpenStack integration. CpQD is an SDN controller developed by CPqD in Brazil, which has been integrated with OpenStack. Floodlight is an open-source SDN controller that supports integration with OpenStack.

47,Which of the following are true about Pox? Select all that apply.,"a. Pox automatically determines the order to install flow table rules, to avoid inconsistent forwarding behavior.
b. Pox's _handle_PacketIn function determines how a packet should be handled when it arrives at the controller.
c. Pox provides a function to modify flow table entries at a switch.
d. Pox's performance is typically slower than NOX.
e. Pox automatically determines the priority between two conflicting rules.
",,"b,c,d","b,c",,Option b is correct because Pox's _handle_PacketIn function is responsible for determining how a packet should be handled when it arrives at the controller. Option c is also correct as Pox does provide a function to modify flow table entries at a switch.,[],0,6_control_plane,0.9,0.996071383845239
48,What is the difference between a hard timeout and an idle timeout?,"a. A hard timeout occurs exactly at the specified interval, whereas an idle timeout may occur slightly later than the specified interval.
b. A hard timeout expunges a flow table entry regardless of whether there have been active matches, whereas an idle timeout expunges the flow table entry only if there have been no matches for that flow within the specified interval.
c. A hard timeout expunges all flow table entry from the switch, whereas an idle timeout only expunges one flow at a time.
d. A hard timeout expunges a flow table entry for all switches in the network, whereas an idle timeout only expunges the flow table entry on the switches that have seen no matches for that flow within the specified interval.
",,b,b,,"A hard timeout expunges a flow table entry regardless of whether there have been active matches, whereas an idle timeout expunges the flow table entry only if there have been no matches for that flow within the specified interval. This means that a hard timeout is based on a fixed time interval, while an idle timeout is based on the absence of activity for a specific flow.",['https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7426'],1,6_control_plane,0.9,0.9982844071147873
49,Which of the following are true about hubs and learning switches? Select all that apply,"a. A hub implemented in Pox requires all incoming packets to be directed to the controller.
b. A learning switch requires more logic at the controller (in terms of lines of code in Pox) than a hub.
c. A learning switch implemented in Pox can be easily extended to support firewall capabilities.
d. A learning switch implemented in Pox requires all incoming packets to be redirected to the controller.
e. A hub forwards an incoming packet on all ports (except the incoming port), whereas a switch only floods an incoming packet on all ports if it does not have a table entry that determines the output port for that packet.
",,"b,c,e","b,e",,"Option b is correct because a learning switch requires more logic at the controller compared to a hub due to the additional functionality of learning and updating the forwarding table based on incoming packets. Option e is correct because a hub forwards incoming packets on all ports except the incoming port, while a switch floods an incoming packet on all ports only if it does not have a table entry for that packet.",[],0,6_control_plane,0.9,0.4418775979371552
