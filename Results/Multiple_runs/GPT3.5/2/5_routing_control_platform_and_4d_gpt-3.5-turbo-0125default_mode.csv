32,What are some of the reasons that it is difficult to deploy improvements to BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. Changes are necessarily incremental because of the large installed base of routers that already run BGP.
b. BGP is implemented in hardware, so deploying changes to BGP requires changes on the timescale of hardware development cycles.
c. Deplyoing changes to BGP requires coordination across potentially tens of thousands of ASes in the Internet.
d. Only a few vendors implement BGP, and deploying changes requires convincing those vendors to change the protocol.
e. Deploying changes requires coordination in standards bodies such as the IETF.
",,"a,c,e","a,c,e",,"a. Changes are necessarily incremental because of the large installed base of routers that already run BGP. Deploying significant changes to BGP all at once is challenging due to the vast number of existing routers using BGP. c. Deploying changes to BGP requires coordination across potentially tens of thousands of ASes in the Internet. BGP operates in a decentralized manner, and any changes need to be coordinated across numerous Autonomous Systems (ASes) in the Internet. e. Deploying changes requires coordination in standards bodies such as the IETF. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) plays a significant role in developing and standardizing protocols like BGP, making coordination through standards bodies essential for deploying improvements to BGP.",['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/25229-bgpfaq-00.html'],1,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.9,0.5832656436694393
33,Which of the following are true about the RCP? Select all that apply.,"a. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, the RCP controller for an AS sees all routes for all destinations that an AS learns from neighboring ASes.
b. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, there is no need for ASes to use BGP to exchange routes.
c. In an RCP deployment, routers no longer have to compute routes.
d. The RCP controller operates just like a route reflector would, selecting a single best route for each destination for all client routers.
e. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, a single AS can benefit from deploying RCP even if no other ASes deploy RCP.
",,"c,e","a,b,e",,"a. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, the RCP controller for an AS sees all routes for all destinations that an AS learns from neighboring ASes. This is true as the RCP controller needs to have a global view of all routes learned from neighboring ASes.
b. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, there is no need for ASes to use BGP to exchange routes. This is true because RCP takes over the route computation and distribution tasks, eliminating the need for BGP in Phase 1.
e. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, a single AS can benefit from deploying RCP even if no other ASes deploy RCP. This is true as even within a single AS, RCP can provide benefits such as centralized route computation and optimization.",[],0,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.9,0.2436117900737684

d. The second phase of deployment requires fewer BGP sessions at the RCP controller than the first phase, thus improving scalability of the controller.
e. In the second phase of RCP deployment, ASes do not need to use BGP to exchange routes with one another.
",,"b,c","b,c",,Option b is correct because the second phase of RCP deployment offers potential benefits such as reduced routing table size by allowing the RCP controller to see all routes for every destination that neighboring ASes advertise (Option c).

38,What are some examples of how a separate decision plane in the 4D architecture can amortize system overhead? Select all that apply.,"a. Maintaining a single table in memory of AS paths that are learned across all BGP sessions in the AS, and using references into that table for specific routers (and routing decisions), to save memory.
