62,Which of the following are true of “network slicing”? Select all that apply.,"a. Network operators can use slicing to test configurations on “shadow” networks that mirror a production network topology.
b. One way to slice networks is according to “flow space”, whereby different controllers might control distinct and non-overlapping traffic flows.
c. A controller can prevent one network slice from interfering with the resources of another.
d. Multi-tenant datacenters are one use case for network slicing.
e. Conventional (i.e., non-SDN) networks have no concept of network virtualization or slicing.
",,"a,b,d","b,c,d",,"Option b is correct because slicing networks according to flow space allows different controllers to manage separate traffic flows, ensuring better isolation and control. Option c is true as a controller in network slicing can enforce isolation between slices to prevent interference with each other. Option d is also accurate as multi-tenant datacenters can benefit from network slicing to create virtual networks for different tenants.",[],0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,0.5857421997679276
63,Which of the following are true about flow spaces? Select all that apply.,"a. Two flow spaces cannot overlap.
b. One host could send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces.
c. Flow spaces can only be defined according to combinations of packet header fields.
d. Flowspace isolation separates individual virtual networks from one another but incurs some performance penalty for doing so.
e. Two controllers that write data-plane rules for non-overlapping parts of flowspace can never cause traffic from one “slice” to enter the other slice.
",,b,"b,d",,"{'b': 'One host could send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces. This is possible when the traffic from a single host satisfies the matching criteria for rules in two different flow spaces.', 'd': 'Flowspace isolation separates individual virtual networks from one another but incurs some performance penalty for doing so. While flowspace isolation provides network segmentation benefits, it can introduce performance overhead due to the need for additional processing to enforce the isolation.'}",[],0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,0.9732483273171223
64,Which of the following describe the control-plane checks that FlowVisor implements? Select all that apply.,"a. When a packet must be forwarded to a controller, Flowvisor forwards traffic to the correct controller based on which controller “owns” the flowspace corresponding to that packet.
b. Flowvisor prevents each slice's controller from being the target of a denial of service attack from other slices.
c. Flowvisor can only instantiate network slices based on the network topology, not based on other properties, such as application traffic.
d. Flowvisor prevents a controller from writing data-plane rules to a part of flowspace that it does not own.
e. Flowvisor installs traffic shaping and quality of service rules to ensure that each network slice has guaranteed resources.
",,"a,d","a,b,d",,"FlowVisor implements the following control-plane checks: 
a. When a packet must be forwarded to a controller, Flowvisor forwards traffic to the correct controller based on which controller 'owns' the flowspace corresponding to that packet. This ensures proper handling of packets by the respective controllers. 
b. Flowvisor prevents each slice's controller from being the target of a denial of service attack from other slices. This security measure is crucial to maintain the integrity and availability of the network slices. 
d. Flowvisor prevents a controller from writing data-plane rules to a part of flowspace that it does not own. This restriction helps in maintaining the isolation and security of network slices.",[],0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,0.9892982498239536
65,Which of the following are applications in a home network that network slicing could enable? Select all that apply.,"a. Quality of service for certain applications (e.g., video streaming)
b. Traceback of attack traffic to its source
c. Smart grid applications
d. Load balance of inbound traffic
e. Guest WiFi access
",,"a,c,e","a,c,e",,"Network slicing in a home network can enable various applications such as providing quality of service for specific applications like video streaming (a), supporting smart grid applications (c), and segregating resources to allow for services like guest WiFi access (e).

69,What are examples of multi-tenant datacenter applications? Select all that apply.,"a. Amazon hosting EC2 instances for customers
b. A home network owner running a private and public WiFi network

d. Google running Gmail and search from a common facility
e. Two enterprises hosting data in a shared facility.
",,"a,d,e","a,c,d,e",,"The correct examples of multi-tenant datacenter applications are: a. Amazon hosting EC2 instances for customers - where Amazon provides virtual instances to multiple customers on shared physical infrastructure, c. A retailer running a large, multi-site enterprise network across its global network of sites - where multiple sites of the retailer share the same network infrastructure, d.

70,What best describes the relationship between network virtualization and SDN? Select all that apply.,"a. SDN controllers can help manage storage and data facilities, in addition to network configuration
b. SDN predates network virtualization
c. Network virtualization requires SDN
d. SDN makes some aspects of network virtualization easier to manage
e. Network virtualization enables SDN
",,"a,d","c,d,e",,"Network virtualization and SDN are closely related concepts. Network virtualization relies on SDN to create and manage virtual networks efficiently. SDN simplifies the management of network functions, making aspects of network virtualization easier to handle.

71,Which of the following are true about NVP? Select all that apply.,"a. NVP allows tenants to configure logical datapaths on their own virtual hosts.
b. NVP relies on switches with custom hardware.
c. NVP allows tenants to configure switches in the middle of the network for portions of flowspace that they own.
d. Exact matches for policies in NVP must always be performed in user space on the host.
e. In NVP, most of the “intelligence” for datapath processing lies in virtual hosts, not in switches.

c. NVP allows tenants to configure switches in the middle of the network for portions of flowspace that they own: This is true as NVP enables tenants to configure switches in the network for their specific flowspace.
e. In NVP, most of the 'intelligence' for datapath processing lies in virtual hosts, not in switches: This is true as NVP architecture places intelligence in virtual hosts rather than switches.",[],0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,0.678874875093208
