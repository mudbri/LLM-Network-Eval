91,You have noticed that a server with IP 145.45.3.2 doesn’t respond to requests. What command will you type first in order to test connectivity between your device and the server?,"a. request 145.45.3.2
b. check 145.45.3.2
c. ping 145.45.3.2
d. ping 145.45.3.2
",,c,d,,The correct command to test connectivity between your device and the server with IP 145.45.3.2 is 'ping 145.45.3.2'. The ping command sends ICMP echo request packets to the destination IP address and waits for ICMP echo reply packets in response. This helps in determining if the server is reachable and responsive.,['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13730-7.html'],0,chapter5_ipv4_routing,0.95,0.6594524562647444
92,"A LAN design uses a Layer 3 EtherChannel between two switches SW1 and SW2, with port-channel interface 1 used on both switches. SW1 uses ports G0/1 and G0/2 in the channel. However, only interface G0/1 is bundled into the channel and working. Think about the configuration settings on port G0/2 that could have existed before adding G0/2 to the EtherChannel. Which answers identify a setting that could prevent IOS from adding G0/2 to the Layer 3 EtherChannel? (Choose two answers.)","a. A different STP cost (spanning-tree cost value)
b. A different access VLAN (switchport access vlan vlanid)
c. A different speed (speed value)
d. A default setting for switchport (switchport)
",,"c,d","a,c",,"The different STP cost (spanning-tree cost value) and a different speed value on port G0/2 could prevent IOS from adding G0/2 to the Layer 3 EtherChannel.

93,"A network engineer has configured a Layer 3 switch with SVIs for VLANs 4 and 5. Hosts in the subnets using VLANs 4 and 5 can ping each other with the Layer 3 switch routing the packets. The next week, the network engineer receives a call that those same users can no longer ping each other. If the problem is with the Layer 3 switching function, which of the following could have caused the problem? (Choose two answers.)","a. A shutdown command issued from VLAN 4 configuration mode
b. VTP on the switch removing VLAN 5 from the switch’s VLAN list
c. 1 out of 10 working VLAN 4 access ports failing due to physical problems
d. A shutdown command issued from VLAN 6 configuration mode
",,"a,b","a,c",,"Option a could have caused the problem if a shutdown command was issued from VLAN 4 configuration mode, which would bring down the SVI for VLAN 4, causing communication issues for hosts in that VLAN. Option c could also be a reason if 1 out of 10 working VLAN 4 access ports failed due to physical problems, leading to connectivity problems for hosts in that VLAN.",[],0,chapter5_ipv4_routing,0.9,0.8317196059845898
