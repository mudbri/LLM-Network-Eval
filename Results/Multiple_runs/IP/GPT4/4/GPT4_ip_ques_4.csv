Therefore, the default mask for the network in the context of this question is 255.255.255.0, which is typical for a subnetted Class B network. The network ID is not 172.0.0.0 as that would be incorrect for a Class B address, and the broadcast address of the network would not be 172.255.255.255 unless the network were using the default Class B mask, which is not indicated in the question. The number of host bits in the unsubnetted network is 16, which is true for a Class B network, but the question specifies 'in the unsubnetted network', and since the network appears to be subnetted with a 255.255.255.0 mask, this would not be applicable.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classful_network', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork']",0,chapter3_ipv4_addressing,0.95,0.6619273441285533

Class A addresses are defined by a leading bit pattern of 0, which means any address from 0.0.0.0 up to 127.255.255.255 is considered Class A. Although 200.0.0.0 is higher than 127, the question refers to it as a 'network ID,' which suggests that we are to consider the default classful behavior without subnetting. In a classful context, 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255 would be Class B, and 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255 would be Class C. Therefore, 200.0.0.0 would not fit into Classes B or C. However, given the context of the question, this might be a mistake, and the address actually falls into the Class C range when considering classful addressing.
