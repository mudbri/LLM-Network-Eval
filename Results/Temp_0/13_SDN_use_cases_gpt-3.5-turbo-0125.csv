95,What are some benefits to using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Host configuration is simpler, since all hosts are visible from a single large Ethernet topology.
b. Forwarding on physical MAC addresses is simpler, since both the data center network topology and hosts' physical MAC addresses are hierarchical.
c. IP routing does not need to be reconfigured when physical or virtual machines move from one part of the network to another.
d. Scaling problems are simpler, since all hosts are configured on a single, flat topology.
e. Load balancing is easier on a layer-2 topology than on a layer 3 topology.
",,"a,c","a,b",,"a. Using a layer-2 MAC topology makes host configuration simpler as all hosts are visible from a single large Ethernet topology, reducing complexity. This simplification is due to the flat nature of layer-2 networks. b. Forwarding on physical MAC addresses is simpler in a layer-2 MAC topology because both the data center network topology and hosts' physical MAC addresses are hierarchical, making forwarding decisions more straightforward.",['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/data-center-virtualization/application-centric-infrastructure/white-paper-c11-731302.html'],0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,0.9426189981177198,0.1999999999999999
96,"In PortLand, what are the reasons for assigning hosts pseudo-MAC addresses, as opposed to simply forwarding traffic on physical MAC addresses? Select all that apply.","a. Hosts in the data-center network topology are more vulnerable to attack if they expose their actual physical MAC addresses, rather than having a layer of indirection.
b. It is very difficult to load balance traffic using physical MAC addresses; pseudo MAC addresses make it possible to assign traffic to destination IP addresses.
c. Without pseudo-MAC addresses, switches would have to update forwarding state whenever hosts with a particular MAC address moved from one portion of the topology to another.
d. Forwarding loops are be more common in a flat layer-2 topology than they are in a topology with hierarchical pseudo MAC addresses.
e. In a flat layer-2 topology, switches cannot know on which port to forward traffic without maintaining switch tables for each MAC address, since MAC addresses are flat, not hierarchical.
",,"c,e","a,c,e",,"a. Assigning hosts pseudo-MAC addresses adds a layer of security by not exposing the actual physical MAC addresses, reducing vulnerability to attacks. This is a common practice in SDN for security reasons. c. Pseudo-MAC addresses help in maintaining network stability by avoiding frequent updates of forwarding state in switches when hosts move within the network. e. In a flat layer-2 topology, switches need to maintain switch tables for each MAC address to know where to forward traffic, which is simplified by using hierarchical pseudo-MAC addresses.","['https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/PortLand.pdf', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140366416301145']",0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.95,0.7095343539149668,0.6000000000000001
97,What are the steps involved in the Proxy ARP process that PortLand's Fabric Manager runs?,"a. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns returns PMAC directly to the end host.
b. Edge switch sends ARP query to fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch updates its local PMAC mapping table.
c. Host sends ARP query, fabric manager intercepts ARP query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to end host.
d. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to the host.
e. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch returns PMAC to end host.
",,e,a,,"In the Proxy ARP process that PortLand's Fabric Manager runs, the correct sequence of steps involves the host sending an ARP query, the edge switch intercepting the query and redirecting it to the fabric manager, and then the fabric manager consulting the PMAC mapping table and returning the PMAC directly to the end host.

98,"What are some of the disadvantages of today's interdomain routing protocol, BGP? Select all that apply.","a. ISPs cannot load-balance traffic across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix.
b. Routing and forwarding decisions are only based on IP prefix, not on a broader range of traffic flow attributes.
c. ISPs can only influence route selection through indirect mechanisms (e.g., prepending), rather than directly manipulating the forwarding table entries in switches.
d. ISPs cannot express preference of one route over another, given multiple routes to a destination.
e. ISPs can only influence the routing decisions of their immediate neighbor, not the entire end-to-end path.
",,"b,c,e","a,b,c,d,e",,"a. BGP does not support traffic load balancing across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix effectively. It typically selects a single best path based on its attributes. Load balancing is a challenge in BGP.
b. BGP makes routing decisions based on the destination IP prefix and does not consider a broader range of traffic flow attributes, limiting its ability to optimize routing based on various factors.
c. ISPs can influence route selection indirectly in BGP through techniques like AS path prepending but cannot directly manipulate forwarding table entries in switches, which limits fine-grained control over routing.
d. BGP lacks the ability to express a preference for one route over another when multiple routes to a destination exist. It typically selects the best path based on its attributes without considering other factors.
e. In BGP, ISPs can influence the routing decisions of their immediate neighbors through BGP attributes and policies but have limited control over the entire end-to-end path, which can lead to suboptimal routing decisions.","['https://blog.thousandeyes.com/bgp-routing-protocol-basics-and-why-its-important/', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/13753-25.html']",0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.95,0.5406090487613215,0.1999999999999999
