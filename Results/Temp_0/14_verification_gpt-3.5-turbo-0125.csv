106,Which of the following are true about configuration verification? Select all that apply.,"a. Configuration verification can only detect errors after the configuration is installed on production routers.
b. Configuration verification cannot detect incorrect protocol behavior that may result from faulty hardware.
c. Verifying the correctness of network behavior based on configuration requires a model of protocol behavior.

e. Configuration verification cannot detect incorrect protocol behavior that may result from buggy software.
",,"b,c,e",c,,Verifying the correctness of network behavior based on configuration requires a model of protocol behavior.

b. The current settings of link weights will result in all routers being connected.
c. The configuration of route reflectors and clients ensures that any route learned from a neighboring AS will propagate to all routers in the topology.
d. There is no traffic pattern that would ever result in a stateful firewall dropping traffic.
e. Any time that an infection occurs, hosts are automatically quarantined.

b. By verifying the current settings of link weights, it can be determined if all routers are indeed connected as intended. This is a network connectivity verification that can be done through configuration checks. 
c. Configuration verification can confirm that the setup of route reflectors and clients is correctly configured to propagate routes learned from neighboring AS to all routers in the network.

108,Which of the following are true about data-plane verification? Select all that apply.,"a. Data-plane verification techniques such as header-space analysis typically operate on a single ""snapshot"" of data-plane state.
b. Data plane verification can only operate on the forwarding table of a single router or switch; network-wide analysis is not possible.
c. Data-plane verification may detect errors that configuration analysis can miss in the cases of buggy control-plane software.
d. Data-plane verification requires accurate modeling of network protocols, including which bits are present in which part of the packet header.
e. Header-space analysis can only provide verification/analysis for specific packets; it cannot answer questions for general parts of flowspace.
",,"a,c","a,c,d",,"a. Data-plane verification techniques like header-space analysis typically work on a single 'snapshot' of data-plane state to analyze packet forwarding behavior.

109,Which of the following assertions could be verified with data plane verification? Select all that apply.,"a. The network will remain connected, given the failure of at most two links.
b. Two virtual network ""slices"" are not completely isolated: it is possible for traffic to travel from one slice to the other.
c. The configuration of the network's routing protocols will result in persistent oscillation (i.e., they will never settle on a stable set of routes).
d. The forwarding table state in the routers across the network will result in a forwarding loop.
e. The rules installed on the firewalls in the network ensure that only port 80 traffic can ever reach the web server from the rest of the Internet.
",,"b,d,e","b,e",,"a. Verifying network connectivity given link failures is more related to fault tolerance mechanisms and network resilience, which are typically validated in the control plane rather than data plane verification. This is not a direct data plane verification task.
b. Ensuring traffic isolation between virtual network slices involves examining the actual forwarding behavior of the network devices, making it a suitable task for data plane verification.
c. Verifying persistent oscillation in routing protocols is more about stability and convergence, which are aspects typically addressed in the control plane rather than data plane verification.
d. Detecting forwarding loops in the forwarding table state is more related to loop prevention mechanisms and routing algorithms, which are typically part of control plane operations rather than data plane verification.
