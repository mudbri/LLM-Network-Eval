b. Reduction of expenditures
c. Easier configuration and management
d. Improved security
",,"a,b","b,d",,a. Introduction of new services is not directly related to the elimination of in-band signaling from the phone network in the 1980s. It may have been a byproduct but not a direct advantage of this change. b. Elimination of in-band signaling helped in reducing expenditures by simplifying the network infrastructure. c. Easier configuration and management could be a benefit but not directly related to the elimination of in-band signaling. d. Improved security was one of the key advantages of removing in-band signaling as it helped in enhancing the security posture of the network.,['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030859618790012X'],0,2_history_and_evolution_SDN,0.9,0.6988783535215242,0.0
12,What types of functions were enabled by active networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Packets carrying code in the payload could be executed on intermediate nodes in the network (e.g., routers, switches)
b. A single node in the network could perform more than one function on a packet or stream of packets (e.g., firewalling, followed by load balance).
c. Code installed on nodes in the network (e.g., at routers and switches) could process packets.
d. Code running on end hosts (e.g., machines sending and receiving packets) could modify packet contents.
e. All routers in the network needed to support active networks for active networks to be deployable.
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c,d",,"Active networks enabled various functions including: 
a. Allowing packets to carry code in the payload for execution on intermediate nodes in the network. This was a key feature of active networks. 
b. Allowing a single node in the network to perform multiple functions on a packet or stream of packets, such as firewalling followed by load balancing. 
c. Allowing code installed on nodes in the network (e.g., routers and switches) to process packets, enhancing network capabilities. 
d. Allowing code running on end hosts (e.g., machines sending and receiving packets) to modify packet contents, providing flexibility and customization. 
Therefore, options a, b, c, and d are functions that were enabled by active networks.",['https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/active-network'],0,2_history_and_evolution_SDN,1.0,0.9927274579586948,0.6000000000000001
13,Which of the following is true about network virtualization? Select all that apply.,"a. Network virtualization requires every router and switch in the network to run custom technology supporting virtualization.
b. Network virtualization requires the instantiation of virtual machines at each intermediate node (e.g., switch, router) in the network.
c. Network virtualization allows multiple service providers to share the same underlying physical infrastructure.
d. Virtual networks can be realized by dividing switch forwarding tables based on fields in the packet header (e.g., IP address and port).
e. Network virtualization was invented in the late 2000s to support the migration of virtual machines in data centers.
",,"c,d","c,d",,"a. Network virtualization does not necessarily require custom technology on every router and switch; it can be achieved through various methods like overlays and software-defined networking (SDN).
b. Instantiating virtual machines at each intermediate node is not a typical approach in network virtualization.
c. Network virtualization indeed allows multiple service providers to share the same physical infrastructure, enabling resource optimization and flexibility.
d. Virtual networks can be created by dividing switch forwarding tables based on packet header fields, enabling the isolation and segmentation of traffic.
e. The statement about the invention of network virtualization in the late 2000s is inaccurate; virtualization concepts predate that time.
Therefore, the correct statements are options c and d.","['https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/network-virtualization', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/software-defined-networking']",1,2_history_and_evolution_SDN,0.9,0.9999739843262136,1.0
