36,What ordering of TCP flags make up the Three-Way Handshake?,"a. SYN, ACK, FIN
b. SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK
c. FIN, FIN/ACK, ACK
d. SYN, ACK, SYN, ACK
",,b,b,,"The Three-Way Handshake involves the following sequence of TCP flags: the client sends a packet with the SYN flag, the server responds with a packet containing both the SYN and ACK flags, and finally, the client acknowledges the server's response with a packet containing only the ACK flag.","['https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-3-way-handshake-process/', 'https://www.coursera.org/articles/three-way-handshake']",1,3_transport_application_layer,1.0,0.999997064707508,1.0

b. 4
c. 32
d. 8
",,a,a,,"A port field in TCP and UDP is 16 bits long, allowing for a total of 65,536 different port numbers.","['https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc768']",1,3_transport_application_layer,1.0,0.99999360781743,1.0
38,A device that blocks traffic that meets certain criteria is known as a ________.,"a. Hub
b. Router
c. Switch
d. Firewall
",,d,d,,A device that blocks traffic based on certain criteria is known as a firewall.

39,Which TCP flag is used to make the listening program respond immediately?,"a. ACK
b. PSH
c. URG
d. RST
",,b,b,,The PSH (Push) flag is used to make the listening program respond immediately by pushing the data to the receiving application without waiting to fill the maximum segment size.,['https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-flags/'],1,3_transport_application_layer,0.95,0.9999974223173222,1.0

b. Ephemeral ports
c. Sockets
d. System ports
",,b,b,,Ephemeral ports are identified as ports 49152 through 65535. These ports are used as temporary ports by the operating system when a connection is established from a client to a server.,['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeral_port'],1,3_transport_application_layer,1.0,0.99999563426853,1.0
41,"Unlike our five-layer model, the OSI network model adds two more layers on top of the Application Layer. Select examples of these new layers below.","a. The compression layer
b. The session layer
c. The interconnection layer
d. The presentation layer
",,"b,d","b,d",,"In the OSI network model, the two additional layers on top of the Application Layer are the Session Layer (responsible for establishing, maintaining, and terminating connections between applications) and the Presentation Layer (responsible for data translation, encryption, and compression).",['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/'],1,3_transport_application_layer,1.0,0.998752373164008,1.0

44,Which part of the operating system does the application use to communicate the need to establish a TCP connection?,"a. Networking stack
b. ARP message
c. The source port
d. The router
",,a,a,,The application uses the networking stack of the operating system to communicate the need to establish a TCP connection.
