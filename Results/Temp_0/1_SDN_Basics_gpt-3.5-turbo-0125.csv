1,Which of the following are true about Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)? Select all that apply.,"a. The only sizes for an IP address allocation before CIDR were 8, 16, or 24 bits.
b. The prefix length for a CIDR prefix can be anywhere in the range from 0 to 32 bits.
c. In an Internet forwarding table with CIDR, there can only be one unique matching entry for any given IP address.
d. CIDR slowed the rate of Internet routing table growth because prefixes no longer had to be allocated in fixed-size blocks.
",,"b,d","b,d",,"a. This statement is incorrect. Before CIDR, IP address allocations were based on classes (Class A, B, C) with fixed prefix lengths of 8, 16, or 24 bits. CIDR introduced variable-length prefixes.
b. This statement is correct. CIDR allows for prefixes with lengths anywhere in the range from 0 to 32 bits, providing flexibility in address allocation.
c. This statement is incorrect. CIDR allows for aggregation of IP prefixes, leading to fewer but more specific routing table entries.
d. This statement is correct. CIDR helped slow the rate of Internet routing table growth by allowing more efficient allocation of address space and reducing the need for fixed-size block allocations.",['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-cidr/'],1,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.9897446883188672,1.0
2,Which of the following are true about how DNS lookups work? Select all that apply.,"a. A DNS A-record query for google.com will only return a single IP address at a time.
b. An NS-record query for a DNS lookup will return the name(s) of the authoritative name server(s) for that domain.
c. If your local DNS resolver caches an NS record for google.com for multiple days, all clients who use that DNS resolver will continue using the same IP address to reach Google’s Web server until that NS record expires.
d. An MX-record query for a DNS lookup will return the IP address of the mail server for that domain.
e. All DNS PTR records are maintained by a single organization in-addr.arpa.
",,b,"b,c",,"b. An NS-record query returns the name(s) of the authoritative name server(s) for the domain. This is essential for resolving queries for that domain.
c. If a local DNS resolver caches an NS record for a domain, all clients using that resolver will continue to use the same IP address until the record expires. This caching mechanism helps in faster resolution and reduces load on authoritative servers.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-ns-record/', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-a-record/']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.9409917218869808,0.6000000000000001
3,Which of the following are true about traffic control with BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
b. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
c. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.

",,"a,b","a,b",,"a. A network operator can indeed use the BGP local preference attribute to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination. This attribute is used to influence the path selection process within the local AS. Higher local preference values are preferred. 
b. BGP AS path prepending is used to influence inbound traffic. By prepending its AS numbers to the AS path announced to its neighbors, a network operator can make certain routes less attractive, thus controlling inbound traffic.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/13753-25.html', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-as-path-prepending/']",1,1_SDN_Basics,1.0,0.9997001136249108,1.0
4,Which of the following are true about layering? Select all that apply.,"a. The network layer guarantees reliable, in-order delivery of packets.
b. The network layer has only a single protocol in widespread use today, representing what we call the “narrow waist”.
c. The transport layer uses port numbers.
d. The destination address in the link layer header is always the address of the next layer-3 node along an end-to-end IP path.
",,"b,c","c,d",,"c. The transport layer uses port numbers for identifying different applications on a single device. This is a true statement about layering and the transport layer. Port numbers help in demultiplexing the data to the correct application on the receiving end.
d. The destination address in the link layer header is not always the address of the next layer-3 node along an end-to-end IP path. The link layer is responsible for node-to-node delivery, and the destination address in the link layer header is typically the address of the next hop in the path, not necessarily the final destination's address.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-the-network-layer/', 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-network-layer-and-link-layer/']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.9997218243970096,0.0

7,Which of the following are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control? Select all that apply.,"a. Only wireless networks can have collisions at the receiver; such collisions are not possible on wired Ethernet networks.
b. Using RTS/CTS (“request to send”, “clear to send”) control reduces the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network.
c. A wireless sender can avoid causing a collision at the receiver by performing a “carrier sense” to determine whether any other sender wants to transmit at the time that it wishes to send a packet.
d. Disabling RTS/CTS necessarily lowers the effective throughput of the wireless network, since more collisions will occur at the receiver without RTS/CTS enabled.
",,b,c,,"Option c is correct. In 802.11 wireless medium access control, a wireless sender can indeed avoid causing a collision at the receiver by performing a 'carrier sense' to check if any other sender wants to transmit at the same time it wishes to send a packet.

8,Which of the following are true about video streaming? Select all that apply.,"a. Using UDP to stream a video instead of TCP is appropriate if the client is more concerned about low delay and interactivity than it does about receiving a high-quality stream.
b. A larger playout buffer at the client allows the client more time to recover from lost packets.
c. Using TCP for video streaming could result in larger delays between transmission and playout than streaming the same video with UDP.
d. Since UDP provides no reliable delivery guarantees, a video streaming application that uses UDP as its transport cannot recover from any packet loss in the video stream.
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"a. Using UDP for video streaming is appropriate when low delay and interactivity are more critical than ensuring every packet is received, as UDP does not have the reliability mechanisms of TCP, making it faster but less reliable for video streaming. This trade-off is common in real-time applications like video streaming. 
b. A larger playout buffer at the client can help mitigate the impact of lost packets by providing more time for the client to recover or receive retransmissions, improving the overall quality of the stream. 
c. TCP's congestion control mechanisms can lead to larger delays in video streaming compared to UDP, especially in scenarios where TCP's retransmission and flow control mechanisms introduce additional latency. UDP, being connectionless and lacking these mechanisms, can offer lower latency for video streaming.",['https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/know-how/tcp-vs-udp-for-streaming/'],1,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.9765142715789452,1.0
9,Which of the following are true about TCP? Select all that apply.,"a. TCP guarantees that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted.
b. A TCP sender and receiver use a “three-way handshake” both to set up and to terminate the TCP connection.
c. TCP’s congestion avoidance algorithm causes the sender to reduce its sending rate by a factor of two when it sees a packet loss.
d. A TCP sender controls its sending rate by adjusting the number of unacknowledged packets that can be sent over the network at any time.
",,"a,c,d","a,b,d",,"a. TCP guarantees that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted, ensuring reliable data transfer. This is achieved through sequence numbers and acknowledgments. 
b. A TCP sender and receiver use a 'three-way handshake' both to set up and to terminate the TCP connection. This process involves SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK segments. 
d. A TCP sender controls its sending rate by adjusting the number of unacknowledged packets that can be sent over the network at any time.

10,Which of the following are true about denial of service attacks (and defenses)? Select all that apply.,"a. If every network on the Internet performed stateless ingress filtering to defend against source IP spoofing, the DNS reflection attack would not work.
b. If every network on the Internet performed stateless egress filtering to defend against source IP address spoofing, the DNS reflection attack could not be carried out.
c. In a “SYN Flood” attack, each TCP SYN packet that a victim receives causes it to set up TCP connection state.
d. A “DNS Reflection” attack requires the attacking client to “spoof” the source IP address of the packet containing the DNS request.
",,"b,c,d","a,d",,"a. Performing stateless ingress filtering helps prevent source IP spoofing, which is crucial in mitigating DNS reflection attacks. By verifying the source IP addresses, the attack can be thwarted. This statement is true. d. In a DNS Reflection attack, the attacker spoofs the source IP address to make it appear as if the request is coming from the victim's IP. This manipulation is a key aspect of DNS Reflection attacks.
