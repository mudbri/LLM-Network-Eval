b. Multicast address
c. IP address
d. MAC address
e. Unicast address
",,"a,b","a,b",,"A broadcast address is used to send one frame and is delivered to all devices on the LAN. It is used when a frame needs to be sent to all devices within the broadcast domain. A multicast address is used to send one frame and is delivered to a specific group of devices on the LAN. It is used when a frame needs to be sent to a select group of devices. IP addresses and MAC addresses are not specifically related to sending one frame to multiple devices. An IP address is used for network layer addressing, and a MAC address is a unique identifier for network interfaces. Unicast address refers to sending one frame to a single device.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_address', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_address']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,0.9,0.9999677859148848,1.0
