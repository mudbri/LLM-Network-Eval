You are responsible to find out why users are not being able to reach the Internet.","a. The cause is not related to dynamic NAT
b. The command output does not provide any clue to identify the problem
c. Dynamic NAT can't use Standard ACLs
d. The NAT pool does not have enough entries to fulfill the user's requests
",,d,d,,"The issue is related to the dynamic NAT configuration. The output shows that all 10 addresses in the NAT pool have been allocated (100% allocated). Since there are no more available addresses in the pool, new user requests cannot be fulfilled, resulting in users not being able to reach the Internet.",['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipaddr_nat/configuration/15-mt/nat-15-mt-book/iadnat-dyn-nat-consv.html'],1,chapter11_ip_services,0.9,0.999999091165773,1.0

b. 3
c. 4
d. 5

201,"R1 and R2 are attached to the same Ethernet VLAN, with subnet 192.168.1.0/24, and addresses 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2 respectively. The routers use an FHRP. Host A and host B attach to the same LAN and have correct default router settings per the FHRP configuration. Which of the following statements is true for this LAN?","a. You can't connect two routers to the same LAN subnet.
b. If one router fails, hosts can't send packets off-subnet
c. If one router fails, both hosts will use the one remaining router as a default router
d. if one router fails, only one of the two hosts will still be able to send packets off-subnet
",,c,c,,"Option C is correct. In this scenario, with both routers R1 and R2 attached to the same Ethernet VLAN and using an FHRP (First Hop Redundancy Protocol) like HSRP or VRRP, if one router fails, both hosts (Host A and Host B) will automatically start using the remaining router as the default gateway.

- Bandwidth management helps in controlling the amount of data that can be transmitted in a given period. 
- Low Latency Queuing (LLQ) prioritizes delay-sensitive traffic to minimize delays. 
- Managing loss is crucial to ensure data integrity and reliability during transmission. 
- Delay management is essential for real-time applications to reduce latency. 
- Class of Service (CoS) is used to differentiate and prioritize traffic based on different classes or types. 
- Jitter management is important for maintaining consistent packet delivery times, especially for real-time communication applications.",['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/12_2/qos/configuration/guide/fqos_c/qcfconav.html'],0,chapter11_ip_services,1.0,0.7332084522097454,0.3333333333333333
