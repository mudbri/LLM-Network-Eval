16,Which of the following command is used to generate an OpenFlow network topology consisting of a single switch and 8 hosts with randomly generated MAC addresses for each host?,"a. sudo mn --topo single,8  --switch ovsk --controller remote
b. sudo mn --topo single,3 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
c. sudo mn --topo single,8 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
d. sudo mn --topo linear,8  --switch ovsk --controller remote
",,a,c,,"The correct command to generate an OpenFlow network topology consisting of a single switch and 8 hosts with randomly generated MAC addresses for each host is 'sudo mn --topo single,8 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote'. This command specifies a single switch with 8 hosts, generates random MAC addresses for each host, uses the Open vSwitch kernel module, and sets the controller to remote.",['https://github.com/mininet/mininet'],0,3_mininet_setup,1.0,0.9999232805730858,0.0

c. Generates sequential MAC addresses for the switch ports, matching their IP address.
d. Generates random MAC addresses for the switch ports.

b. To enable visibility and control over multiple switch flow table.
c. Is an OpenFlow controller.
