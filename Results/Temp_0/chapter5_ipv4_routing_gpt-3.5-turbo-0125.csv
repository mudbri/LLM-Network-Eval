91,You have noticed that a server with IP 145.45.3.2 doesn’t respond to requests. What command will you type first in order to test connectivity between your device and the server?,"a. request 145.45.3.2

92,"A LAN design uses a Layer 3 EtherChannel between two switches SW1 and SW2, with port-channel interface 1 used on both switches. SW1 uses ports G0/1 and G0/2 in the channel. However, only interface G0/1 is bundled into the channel and working. Think about the configuration settings on port G0/2 that could have existed before adding G0/2 to the EtherChannel. Which answers identify a setting that could prevent IOS from adding G0/2 to the Layer 3 EtherChannel? (Choose two answers.)","a. A different STP cost (spanning-tree cost value)
b. A different access VLAN (switchport access vlan vlanid)
c. A different speed (speed value)
d. A default setting for switchport (switchport)
",,"c,d","a,b",,"A and B are the correct answers. In order for ports to be bundled into an EtherChannel, they need to have matching configurations. If there is a difference in STP cost (answer A) or access VLAN (answer B) between the ports, the switch will not add the port to the EtherChannel. These inconsistencies in configuration settings can prevent the ports from forming an EtherChannel.",['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750x_3560x/software/release/12-2_55_se/configuration/guide/3750xscg/swethchl.html'],0,chapter5_ipv4_routing,0.9,0.5829654522289158,0.0
93,"A network engineer has configured a Layer 3 switch with SVIs for VLANs 4 and 5. Hosts in the subnets using VLANs 4 and 5 can ping each other with the Layer 3 switch routing the packets. The next week, the network engineer receives a call that those same users can no longer ping each other. If the problem is with the Layer 3 switching function, which of the following could have caused the problem? (Choose two answers.)","a. A shutdown command issued from VLAN 4 configuration mode
b. VTP on the switch removing VLAN 5 from the switch’s VLAN list
c. 1 out of 10 working VLAN 4 access ports failing due to physical problems
d. A shutdown command issued from VLAN 6 configuration mode
",,"a,b","a,b",,"A and B are the correct answers. A Layer 3 switch will not route packets on a VLAN interface unless it is in an up/up state. A VLAN interface will only be up/up if the matching VLAN (with the same VLAN number) exists on the switch. If VTP deletes the VLAN, then the VLAN interface moves to a down/down state, and the routing on that interface stops. Also, disabling VLAN 4 with the shutdown command in VLAN configuration mode causes the matching VLAN 4 interface to fail, which makes routing on interface VLAN 4 stop as well. A Layer 3 switch needs only one access port or trunk port forwarding for a VLAN to enable routing for that VLAN, so nine of the ten access ports in VLAN 4 could fail, leaving one working port, and the switch would keep routing for VLAN 4. A shutdown of VLAN 6 can’t affect the VLANs 4 and 5.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_virtual_interface', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/aci/apic/sw/4-x/L3-configuration/Cisco-APIC-Layer-3-Networking-Configuration-Guide-42x/Cisco-APIC-Layer-3-Networking-Configuration-Guide-42x_chapter_01101.pdf']",1,chapter5_ipv4_routing,0.95,0.998126664070257,1.0
