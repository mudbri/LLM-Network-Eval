72,"In NFV, which of the following is the function of steering?","a. Finding the best location to place a single network function in an enterprise or wide area network.
b. Installing custom packet processing code on servers in the network.
c. Placing middleboxes at places throughout the network to minimize network load.
d. Installing custom packet processing code on switches in the network.
e. Installing flow table entries in switches to forward traffic through network functions or middleboxes that are installed in the network
",,e,e,,"In NFV (Network Function Virtualization), the function of steering involves installing flow table entries in switches to direct traffic through network functions or middleboxes that are deployed in the network. This process helps in routing traffic efficiently through the desired network functions.",['https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/network-function-virtualization'],1,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.9,0.9999789459686392,1.0
74,What are some advantages of Docker containers over virtual machines? Select all that apply.,"a. Containers can be connected to build a virtual network, whereas virtual machines cannot.
b. Performance in containers may be better since they invoke OS system calls directly, rather than through an emulated machine.
c. Containers require less storage and memory per-instance, and require less time to instantiate than virtual machines.
d. Containers provide more flexibility in the choice of operating system.
e. Containers provide better isolation than virtual machines.
",,"b,c","b,c,d",,"a. Containers and virtual machines can both be connected to build virtual networks, so this is not a specific advantage of Docker containers over virtual machines. b. Containers have better performance as they share the host OS kernel and make system calls directly. c. Containers are lightweight, requiring less storage, memory, and time to instantiate compared to virtual machines. d. Containers offer flexibility in the choice of operating system, unlike virtual machines that are tied to specific OS images. e. Virtual machines provide stronger isolation due to their independent OS, so this is not an advantage of Docker containers.",['https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container'],0,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.9,0.8875820967348742,0.6000000000000001
75,Which of the following commands is used to instantiate a new Docker container by invoking a command in that container?,"a. docker stop
b. docker attach
c. docker commit
d. docker pull
e. docker run
",,e,e,,The correct command to instantiate a new Docker container by invoking a command in that container is 'docker run'. This command creates and starts a container in one operation.,['https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/'],1,9_NFV_and_Docker,1.0,0.9999951574563252,1.0
76,Which of the following is true about networking Docker containers? Select all that apply.,"a. Docker containers can be networked to each other via the native Docker bridge or Open vSwitch.
b. A Docker container can never expose a low port (e.g., port 80) to the external Internet; Internet hosts must always reach a Docker service by a high port (e.g., 8080).
c. Docker containers running in different virtual machines cannot be networked together.
d. Connecting Docker containers requires setting up GRE tunnels between the containers.
e. Docker containers are not reachable from the external Internet by default.
",,"a,e","a,e",,"a. Docker containers can be networked to each other using the native Docker bridge or through other networking solutions like Open vSwitch. These options provide ways for containers to communicate internally and with the external network. 
e. By default, Docker containers are not reachable from the external Internet. Additional configuration like port mapping or using tools like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes is needed to expose container services to the external Internet.","['https://docs.docker.com/network/', 'https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/']",1,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.9,0.9995517073901726,1.0
