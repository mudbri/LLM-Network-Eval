56,Which of the following are true of the Mininet network emulator? Select all that apply.,"a. It requires running OpenFlow-capable switches.
b. It is difficult to use it to route traffic for real services.
c. Mininet only allows users to create three types of topologies: linear, tree, and single-switch topologies.
d. It can create an emulation that runs across multiple physically distributed nodes.
e. All of the hosts in the topology must run the same underlying operating system.

57,"What are the benefits of emulation as opposed to, say, simulation? Select all that apply.","a. An emulation will complete faster than a simulation.
b. An emulator makes it possible to ""port"" experiments from one machine to another.
c. An emulator allows the experimenter run real software on each of the nodes in the emulation.
d. An emulation is easier to debug than a simulation.
e. Every run of the emulator will yield exactly the same results, resulting in reproducible experiments.

61,Select the statement that is most true about the relationship between network virtualization and SDNs.,"a. Network virtualization is a potential enabler for software-defined networks, since the separation of data and control planes first requires the creation of a logical network.
b. Software-defined networking is a potential enabler for virtual networks, since separation of data and control planes makes it easier to manage a logical network topology.
c. Network virtualization is a new concept introduced by Amazon, Nicira, and industry players; it only made sense to talk about network virtualization once central SDN controllers existed.
d. Network virtualization and software-defined networking each enable the other: SDN cannot exist without network virtualization, and network virtualization cannot exist without SDN.
