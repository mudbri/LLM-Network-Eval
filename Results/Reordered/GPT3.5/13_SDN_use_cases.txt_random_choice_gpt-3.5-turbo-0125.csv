95,What are some benefits to using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Host configuration is simpler, since all hosts are visible from a single large Ethernet topology.
b. Load balancing is easier on a layer-2 topology than on a layer 3 topology.
c. Forwarding on physical MAC addresses is simpler, since both the data center network topology and hosts' physical MAC addresses are hierarchical.
d. IP routing does not need to be reconfigured when physical or virtual machines move from one part of the network to another.
e. Scaling problems are simpler, since all hosts are configured on a single, flat topology.
",,"a,d","a,c",,"Option a is correct because in a layer-2 MAC topology, all hosts are part of the same broadcast domain, making host configuration simpler as they are visible from a single large Ethernet topology. Option c is also correct as forwarding based on physical MAC addresses is simpler in a layer-2 topology due to the hierarchical structure of both the network topology and hosts' physical MAC addresses.",[],0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,0.6663715574084974,0.1999999999999999
96,"In PortLand, what are the reasons for assigning hosts pseudo-MAC addresses, as opposed to simply forwarding traffic on physical MAC addresses? Select all that apply.","a. Hosts in the data-center network topology are more vulnerable to attack if they expose their actual physical MAC addresses, rather than having a layer of indirection.
b. Forwarding loops are be more common in a flat layer-2 topology than they are in a topology with hierarchical pseudo MAC addresses.
c. In a flat layer-2 topology, switches cannot know on which port to forward traffic without maintaining switch tables for each MAC address, since MAC addresses are flat, not hierarchical.
d. Without pseudo-MAC addresses, switches would have to update forwarding state whenever hosts with a particular MAC address moved from one portion of the topology to another.
e. It is very difficult to load balance traffic using physical MAC addresses; pseudo MAC addresses make it possible to assign traffic to destination IP addresses.
",,"c,d","a,c,d",,"a. Hosts in the data-center network topology are more vulnerable to attack if they expose their actual physical MAC addresses, rather than having a layer of indirection: By using pseudo-MAC addresses, hosts can protect their actual MAC addresses from potential attacks, enhancing network security.
c. In a flat layer-2 topology, switches cannot know on which port to forward traffic without maintaining switch tables for each MAC address, since MAC addresses are flat, not hierarchical: Pseudo-MAC addresses provide a hierarchical structure that helps switches determine the correct port for forwarding traffic, simplifying the network operation.
d. Without pseudo-MAC addresses, switches would have to update forwarding state whenever hosts with a particular MAC address moved from one portion of the topology to another: Pseudo-MAC addresses create a level of abstraction that allows switches to maintain consistent forwarding state even when hosts move within the network.",[],0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,0.3680200031884917,0.6000000000000001
97,What are the steps involved in the Proxy ARP process that PortLand's Fabric Manager runs?,"a. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns returns PMAC directly to the end host.
b. Host sends ARP query, fabric manager intercepts ARP query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to end host.
c. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to the host.
d. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch returns PMAC to end host.
e. Edge switch sends ARP query to fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch updates its local PMAC mapping table.
",,d,a,,"The correct steps involved in the Proxy ARP process that PortLand's Fabric Manager runs are as follows: The host sends an ARP query, the edge switch intercepts the query and redirects it to the fabric manager, the fabric manager consults the PMAC mapping table, and returns the PMAC directly to the end host.",[],0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,0.8318880520820202,0.1999999999999999
98,"What are some of the disadvantages of today's interdomain routing protocol, BGP? Select all that apply.","a. ISPs can only influence the routing decisions of their immediate neighbor, not the entire end-to-end path.
b. ISPs cannot load-balance traffic across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix.
c. ISPs cannot express preference of one route over another, given multiple routes to a destination.
d. Routing and forwarding decisions are only based on IP prefix, not on a broader range of traffic flow attributes.
e. ISPs can only influence route selection through indirect mechanisms (e.g., prepending), rather than directly manipulating the forwarding table entries in switches.
",,"a,d,e","a,b,d,e",,"a. ISPs can only influence the routing decisions of their immediate neighbor, not the entire end-to-end path: BGP operates based on the concept of autonomous systems (AS) and each AS makes its own routing decisions, limiting the control to immediate neighbors.
 b. ISPs cannot load-balance traffic across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix: BGP lacks the capability to perform effective load balancing across multiple paths to the same destination.
 d. Routing and forwarding decisions are only based on IP prefix, not on a broader range of traffic flow attributes: BGP primarily uses the destination IP address prefix for routing decisions, neglecting other traffic attributes.
 e. ISPs can only influence route selection through indirect mechanisms (e.g., prepending), rather than directly manipulating the forwarding table entries in switches: BGP influences route selection indirectly through various mechanisms like AS path prepending, lacking direct control over forwarding table entries.",[],0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,0.6223159766417792,0.6000000000000001
101,What are some of the features that an SDX enables that today's IXPs cannot support? Select all that apply.,"a. Application-specific peering
b. Wide-area load balancing using IP packet rewriting
c. Application of different business relationships across different regions of the world (e.g., peering only in a specific geographic region).
d. On-the-fly redirection to middleboxes
e. Wide-area load balancing using DNS-based redirection
",,"a,b,d","a,d",,"a. Application-specific peering: SDX enables application-specific peering, allowing for more fine-grained control over traffic flows based on specific applications. This level of granularity is not typically supported by traditional IXPs.
d. On-the-fly redirection to middleboxes: SDX allows for on-the-fly redirection to middleboxes for functions such as deep packet inspection, firewalling, or network address translation.

103,What are some of the motivations for applying software defined networking in home networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Better performance, since control decisions can be made from a well-provisioned server, as opposed to an under-provisioned router.
b. More fine-grained control over the forwarding behavior of individual devices as conditions in the network change (e.g., a device uses too much bandwidth or data).
c. Ability to better user interfaces to control home network behavior, independent of the interfaces that ship with home router devices.
d. Ability to allow multiple service providers access to the home network infrastructure for different applications and services.
e. Outsourcing control and management of the home network to a third party.
",,"b,c,d,e","a,b,c",,"a. Better performance: By allowing control decisions to be made from a well-provisioned server, SDN can optimize performance in home networks.
b. More fine-grained control: SDN enables adjusting the forwarding behavior of devices as network conditions change, enhancing control over bandwidth usage.
c. Better user interfaces: SDN provides the flexibility to create custom interfaces for controlling home network behavior, independent of standard router interfaces.",[],0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,0.9991565302008042,0.0
104,"Suppose that an operator of a home network wants to write the following policy:
1. Block all traffic to Facebook from my child's computer.
2. Rate limit BitTorrent traffic from my child's computer if the VoIP client on my desktop is active.
Which of the following most closely approximates the policy?
