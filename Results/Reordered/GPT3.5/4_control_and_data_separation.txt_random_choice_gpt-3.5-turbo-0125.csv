25,What could be the operational steps behind the AT&T's IRSCP (a commercial version of the Routing Control Platform) for detecting malicious traffic? Select all that apply.,"a. The controller sees all traffic passing through the network, detects an attack, and installs a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where the attack traffic is originating.
b. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to install a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where attack traffic is originating.
c. A victim end host sends an alert to an on-path firewall about the source and nature of an attack, at which point the firewall installs a null route to drop the traffic at the entry point where the attack is originating.
d. The end host changes its IP address so that it is no longer the target of the attack traffic.
e. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to re-route traffic through a deep-packet inspection device.
",,"b,e",b,,"Option b is correct because in the operational steps of AT&T's IRSCP, a measurement system is responsible for detecting an attack and pinpointing the entry point of the attack. This information is then used to instruct a controller to install a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where the attack traffic is originating. This process helps in effectively mitigating the malicious traffic.",[],0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.9,0.9994786774858282,0.6000000000000001

b. Better security properties.
c. Better load balancing properties.
d. Ability to use existing routing protocols to establish paths between hosts.
e. Better scaling properties.
",,a,"c,e",,"Layer-2 forwarding in a data center offers better load balancing properties as it allows for more granular control over traffic distribution within the data center network. It also provides better scaling properties because it simplifies network design and can handle a large number of hosts without the need for complex subnetting. While Layer-2 forwarding may not necessarily offer better security properties compared to Layer-3 solutions, it can still be advantageous in specific scenarios.

28,How does the separation of the control and data plane make networking in data centers easier?,"a. A network controller can permit the renumbering of end hosts to have topology-dependent Layer 2 MAC addresses.
b. Virtual machines can be migrated within the network without renumbering entire portions of the network or re-assigning network services to different IP addresses.
c. All routes can be controlled and monitored from a central point of control.
d. The control plane allows traffic to be forwarded using Layer 2 addresses, thus allowing automatic load balance across the topology.
e. The separation allows fewer switches to be used in the data center topology, thus lowering costs.
",,"a,b,c","b,c",,"The separation of the control and data plane in Software Defined Networking (SDN) makes networking in data centers easier for the following reasons:

b. Virtual machines can be migrated within the network without renumbering entire portions of the network or re-assigning network services to different IP addresses: This is a key advantage of SDN where the control plane can dynamically update forwarding rules to accommodate VM migrations without the need for manual reconfiguration of network elements.

e. A flood of traffic at the controller.
",,"a,d","c,e",,"When a network has multiple controller replicas, consistency problems in the control plane can lead to incorrect operation when one controller fails (option c) and a flood of traffic at the controller (option e). Having multiple controller replicas can introduce issues related to maintaining consistency across these controllers, which can result in incorrect decisions being made when one of the controllers fails. Additionally, inconsistencies can lead to a flood of traffic at the controller as different replicas may not be in sync, causing multiple controllers to potentially respond to the same events, leading to inefficient use of resources and increased traffic at the controller.",[],0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.9,0.4472092388338833,0.0

32,"Which property guarantees that each RCP replica continues to install correct forwarding state in the network data plane, even in the case of a partition in the data plane?","a. The controller cannot see many of the routers in the network anyway, so there is no way for it to install incorrect routing state in the routers that it is not connected to.
b. Running the network from a single high-level control plane guarantees that network partitions and loops never occur in the first place.
c. Each controller has a complete view of the portion of the network that it is controlling, and therefore can guarantee consistent routing within that partition.
d. The controllers are partitioned from the network routers, and the routers will fall back to running a distributed routing protocol.
