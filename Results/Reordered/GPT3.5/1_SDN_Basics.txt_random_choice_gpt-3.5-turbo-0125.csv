1,Which of the following are true about Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)? Select all that apply.,"a. The only sizes for an IP address allocation before CIDR were 8, 16, or 24 bits.
b. The prefix length for a CIDR prefix can be anywhere in the range from 0 to 32 bits.
c. CIDR slowed the rate of Internet routing table growth because prefixes no longer had to be allocated in fixed-size blocks.
d. In an Internet forwarding table with CIDR, there can only be one unique matching entry for any given IP address.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"{'b': 'The prefix length for a CIDR prefix can indeed be anywhere in the range from 0 to 32 bits.

2,Which of the following are true about how DNS lookups work? Select all that apply.,"a. All DNS PTR records are maintained by a single organization in-addr.arpa.
b. A DNS A-record query for google.com will only return a single IP address at a time.
c. An MX-record query for a DNS lookup will return the IP address of the mail server for that domain.
d. If your local DNS resolver caches an NS record for google.com for multiple days, all clients who use that DNS resolver will continue using the same IP address to reach Google’s Web server until that NS record expires.
e. An NS-record query for a DNS lookup will return the name(s) of the authoritative name server(s) for that domain.
",,e,"b,e",,Option b is correct because a DNS A-record query for a domain name like google.com can return multiple IP addresses associated with that domain due to techniques like round-robin DNS for load balancing purposes. Option e is also correct as an NS-record query in DNS lookup will return the name(s) of the authoritative name server(s) for that domain.,"['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-a-record/', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-ns-record/']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.9543467738312292,0.6000000000000001
3,Which of the following are true about traffic control with BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
b. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
c. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
d. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
",,"c,d","a,b",,"Option a is correct because a network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to influence outbound traffic from their AS to a destination by making their AS path longer, thus making it less preferred. Option b is also correct as the BGP local preference attribute can be used to control inbound traffic to the AS by setting higher local preference values for preferred routes.",[],0,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.9795618337878688,0.0

6,Which of the following are true about content distribution networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Content distribution networks can reduce transit expenses for a content provider by enabling much of the provider’s content to be served from a nearby network, sometimes even from a cache that is within the client’s own network.
b. Real-time content such as video streams cannot be distributed from a content distribution network.
c. Content distribution networks can improve the performance that a client sees by reducing the network latency between the client and the content that it is downloading.
d. Content distribution networks typically redirect Web clients to a nearby Web cache by rewriting the IP address of packets sent from the client to the IP address of the nearby Web cache.
",,"a,c","a,c",,"a. Content distribution networks can reduce transit expenses for a content provider by serving content from nearby networks or caches, reducing the load on the provider's infrastructure. This is a core function of CDN services. c. Content distribution networks can improve client performance by reducing network latency, as they serve content from servers closer to the client, speeding up the delivery process. This is one of the key benefits of using CDNs.",[],1,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.999998852758658,1.0
7,Which of the following are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control? Select all that apply.,"a. Disabling RTS/CTS necessarily lowers the effective throughput of the wireless network, since more collisions will occur at the receiver without RTS/CTS enabled.
b. Using RTS/CTS (“request to send”, “clear to send”) control reduces the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network.
c. A wireless sender can avoid causing a collision at the receiver by performing a “carrier sense” to determine whether any other sender wants to transmit at the time that it wishes to send a packet.
d. Only wireless networks can have collisions at the receiver; such collisions are not possible on wired Ethernet networks.
",,b,"b,c",,"Option b is correct because using RTS/CTS control introduces additional overhead due to the exchange of control frames, which can reduce the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network. Option c is also correct as a wireless sender can indeed perform a 'carrier sense' to check the medium's availability before transmitting to avoid collisions.",[],0,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.7513876281417579,0.5
8,Which of the following are true about video streaming? Select all that apply.,"a. Since UDP provides no reliable delivery guarantees, a video streaming application that uses UDP as its transport cannot recover from any packet loss in the video stream.
b. Using TCP for video streaming could result in larger delays between transmission and playout than streaming the same video with UDP.
c. A larger playout buffer at the client allows the client more time to recover from lost packets.
d. Using UDP to stream a video instead of TCP is appropriate if the client is more concerned about low delay and interactivity than it does about receiving a high-quality stream.
",,"b,c,d","b,c,d",,"a. Incorrect. While UDP does not provide reliable delivery guarantees, video streaming applications can still recover from packet loss by implementing mechanisms like forward error correction (FEC) or retransmission at the application layer.
b. Correct. TCP's congestion control mechanisms can lead to larger delays compared to UDP, which may not be suitable for real-time applications like video streaming.
c. Correct. A larger playout buffer at the client can help in recovering from lost packets by providing more time to receive retransmitted packets or perform error concealment techniques.
d. Correct. UDP is preferred for applications where low delay and interactivity are crucial, as it avoids the overhead and potential delays introduced by TCP's mechanisms.",[],1,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.5728175888555072,1.0
9,Which of the following are true about TCP? Select all that apply.,"a. A TCP sender controls its sending rate by adjusting the number of unacknowledged packets that can be sent over the network at any time.
b. TCP’s congestion avoidance algorithm causes the sender to reduce its sending rate by a factor of two when it sees a packet loss.
c. A TCP sender and receiver use a “three-way handshake” both to set up and to terminate the TCP connection.
d. TCP guarantees that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted.

A TCP sender uses a congestion control mechanism to adjust its sending rate by regulating the number of unacknowledged packets in the network to avoid congestion.', 'b': ""Incorrect. TCP's congestion avoidance algorithm does not reduce the sending rate by a factor of two when it encounters packet loss. Instead, it uses additive increase and multiplicative decrease."", 'c': ""Correct. The 'three-way handshake' is used by TCP to establish and terminate a connection between a sender and receiver."", 'd': 'Correct.

10,Which of the following are true about denial of service attacks (and defenses)? Select all that apply.,"a. In a “SYN Flood” attack, each TCP SYN packet that a victim receives causes it to set up TCP connection state.
b. A “DNS Reflection” attack requires the attacking client to “spoof” the source IP address of the packet containing the DNS request.
c. If every network on the Internet performed stateless ingress filtering to defend against source IP spoofing, the DNS reflection attack would not work.
d. If every network on the Internet performed stateless egress filtering to defend against source IP address spoofing, the DNS reflection attack could not be carried out.
",,"a,b,d",c,,"Option c is correct. Performing stateless ingress filtering to defend against source IP spoofing would prevent the DNS reflection attack because it would filter out packets with spoofed source IP addresses, making it harder for attackers to carry out the attack.",[],0,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.8655578557323065,0.0
