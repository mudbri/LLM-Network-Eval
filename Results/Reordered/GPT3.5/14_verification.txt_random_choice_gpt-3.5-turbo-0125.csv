106,Which of the following are true about configuration verification? Select all that apply.,"a. Configuration verification requires a large-scale simulation of network protocols, complete with tests for different message orderings and timings.
b. Configuration verification cannot detect incorrect protocol behavior that may result from faulty hardware.
c. Configuration verification cannot detect incorrect protocol behavior that may result from buggy software.
d. Verifying the correctness of network behavior based on configuration requires a model of protocol behavior.
e. Configuration verification can only detect errors after the configuration is installed on production routers.
",,"b,c,d","a,d",,"a. Configuration verification requires a large-scale simulation of network protocols, complete with tests for different message orderings and timings: Configuration verification often involves simulating network protocols to test various scenarios and conditions to ensure the correct behavior of the network. This includes testing different message orderings and timings to validate the configuration.
d. Verifying the correctness of network behavior based on configuration requires a model of protocol behavior: To verify the correctness of network behavior, a model of protocol behavior is essential. This model helps in understanding how the network should behave under different conditions.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2997465.2997498', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3098822.3098842']",0,14_verification,0.9,0.8600692230975443,0.0
107,"Which of the following assertions could be verified with configuration verification (i.e., of a snapshot of router and switch configuration)? Select all that apply.","a. There is no traffic pattern that would ever result in a stateful firewall dropping traffic.
b. A route learned from one peer will not be readvertised to another peer.
c. Any time that an infection occurs, hosts are automatically quarantined.
d. The current settings of link weights will result in all routers being connected.
e. The configuration of route reflectors and clients ensures that any route learned from a neighboring AS will propagate to all routers in the topology.
",,"b,d,e","b,d",,"a. This assertion involves the behavior of a stateful firewall, which is a functionality related to network security and packet filtering. Configuration verification does not directly verify the behavior of traffic patterns that would lead to a stateful firewall dropping traffic.

b. This assertion is related to routing protocols and their configurations. By examining the snapshot of router configurations, it is possible to verify if a route learned from one peer will not be readvertised to another peer.

c. Automatic host quarantine in case of infection is a security feature that may not be directly verifiable through configuration verification.

d. The statement involves the connectivity and settings of link weights among routers. By analyzing the current settings, it can be determined if all routers are connected based on the network topology and configuration.

e. This assertion involves the propagation of routes between routers in different autonomous systems (AS). While configuration verification can ensure proper route reflector and client configurations, it does not guarantee the propagation of routes from neighboring AS to all routers in the topology.",[],0,14_verification,0.9,0.9784196636984124,0.6000000000000001
108,Which of the following are true about data-plane verification? Select all that apply.,"a. Data-plane verification may detect errors that configuration analysis can miss in the cases of buggy control-plane software.
b. Data plane verification can only operate on the forwarding table of a single router or switch; network-wide analysis is not possible.
c. Data-plane verification requires accurate modeling of network protocols, including which bits are present in which part of the packet header.
d. Data-plane verification techniques such as header-space analysis typically operate on a single ""snapshot"" of data-plane state.
e. Header-space analysis can only provide verification/analysis for specific packets; it cannot answer questions for general parts of flowspace.

Accurate modeling of network protocols, including the arrangement of bits in packet headers, is essential for effective data-plane verification. d.

109,Which of the following assertions could be verified with data plane verification? Select all that apply.,"a. The rules installed on the firewalls in the network ensure that only port 80 traffic can ever reach the web server from the rest of the Internet.
b. The configuration of the network's routing protocols will result in persistent oscillation (i.e., they will never settle on a stable set of routes).
c. The network will remain connected, given the failure of at most two links.
d. Two virtual network ""slices"" are not completely isolated: it is possible for traffic to travel from one slice to the other.
e. The forwarding table state in the routers across the network will result in a forwarding loop.
",,"a,d,e","a,d",,Data plane verification involves checking the actual behavior of the network by analyzing the traffic flow. Option 'a' can be verified by observing the traffic reaching the web server to ensure only port 80 traffic is allowed.

e. SPEC A [ policy=allow U authenticated ]
",,a,c,,"The correct expression that encodes the statement 'It is always possible for the policy state to go to 'allow'' is c. SPEC AG (!authenticated -> AX policy=allow). This expression ensures that whenever the system is not in an 'authenticated' state, the next state must be 'allow'. Option a is incorrect as it checks if 'policy=allow' eventually holds, not that it is always possible. Option b is incorrect as it enforces that whenever the system is in an 'authenticated' state, the next state must be 'allow', which is not the requirement. Option e is incorrect as it specifies a temporal logic property where 'policy=allow' must be true until 'authenticated' becomes true, which is different from the given statement.",[],0,14_verification,0.9,0.8714953322777267,0.1999999999999999
