21,Which of the following commands checks the status of the interfaces?,"a. show status
b. show interface
c. show status interface
d. show interface status
",,d,b,,The correct command to check the status of the interfaces in Cisco devices is 'show interface'.

22,You are in console line configuration mode. Which of the following commands would place you in enable mode?,"a. back
b. enable
c. change
d. end
",,d,b,,The 'enable' command is used to enter enable mode from the console line configuration mode in Cisco devices. 'back' is not a valid command in this context. 'change' and 'end' are also not the correct commands to enter enable mode.,[],0,chapter2_ethernet_lans,0.95,0.9996264770770632,0.0

b. copy nvram ram
c. copy ram nvram
d. copy startup-config running-config
",,a,a,,"The correct command to copy the configuration from RAM into NVRAM is 'copy running-config startup-config'. Option a is the correct choice because it copies the running configuration in RAM to the startup configuration in NVRAM, ensuring that the changes made are saved and will be used after a reboot.",[],1,chapter2_ethernet_lans,0.9,0.9995439289020552,1.0
24,"The command that configures the switch as a DHCP client to discover its IPv4 address, mask, and default gateway is ip address dhcp.","a. FALSE

26,Which of the following commands administratively enables an interface,"a. enable interface
b. shutdown
c. no shutdown
d. interface enable
",,c,c,,The correct command to administratively enable an interface in Cisco networking is 'no shutdown'. This command brings the interface up and allows it to forward traffic.

27,"Switches use STP to prevent loops by causing some interfaces to block, meaning that they do not send or receive frames.","a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",,a,a,,The statement is true. Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is used by switches to prevent loops in a network by blocking certain redundant paths. This blocking of interfaces helps in ensuring a loop-free topology and prevents broadcast storms.,['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/lan-switching/spanning-tree-protocol/5234-5.html'],1,chapter2_ethernet_lans,0.9,0.9919541038974388,1.0
28,A Layer 2 switch configuration places all its physical ports into VLAN 2. The IP addressing plan shows that address 175.28.1.150 (with mask 255.255.255.0) is reserved for use by this new LAN switch and that 175.28.1.254 is already configured on the router connected to that same VLAN. The switch needs to support SSH connections into the switch from any subnet in the network. Which of the following commands are part of the required configuration in this case? (Choose two answers.),"a. The ip default-gateway 175.28.1.254 command in global configuration mode.
b. The ip address 175.28.1.150 255.255.255.0 command in interface vlan 2 configuration mode.
c. The ip address 172.16.2.250 255.255.255.0 command in interface vlan 1 configuration mode.
d. The ip default-gateway 175.28.1.150 command in global configuration mode.
e. The switch cannot support SSH because all its ports connect to VLAN 2, and the IP address must be configured on interface VLAN 1.
",,"a,b","a,b",,"The correct commands for this scenario are:

a. The ip default-gateway 175.28.1.254 command in global configuration mode: This command sets the default gateway for the switch to be the router's IP address, allowing the switch to reach devices in other subnets.

b. The ip address 175.28.1.150 255.255.255.0 command in interface vlan 2 configuration mode: This command assigns the IP address and subnet mask to the VLAN 2 interface, enabling the switch to be reachable within the network for SSH connections.",[],1,chapter2_ethernet_lans,0.9,0.8883965711600667,1.0
