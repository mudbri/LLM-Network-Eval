16,Which of the following command is used to generate an OpenFlow network topology consisting of a single switch and 8 hosts with randomly generated MAC addresses for each host?,"a. sudo mn --topo single,3 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
b. sudo mn --topo single,8  --switch ovsk --controller remote
c. sudo mn --topo linear,8  --switch ovsk --controller remote
d. sudo mn --topo single,8 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
",,b,d,,"The correct command to generate an OpenFlow network topology consisting of a single switch and 8 hosts with randomly generated MAC addresses for each host is option d. This command specifies a single switch (--topo single,8) connected to 8 hosts with randomly generated MAC addresses (--mac) using the Open vSwitch kernel switch (--switch ovsk) and a remote controller (--controller remote). Options a, b, and c do not include the necessary parameters to generate the desired topology with randomly generated MAC addresses for each host.",[],0,3_mininet_setup,0.9,0.8887230693852697,0.0
17,What is the purpose of --mac flag used in mininet?,"a. Generates random MAC addresses for the hosts.
b. Generates sequential MAC addresses for the hosts, matching their IP address.
c. Generates random MAC addresses for the switch ports.
d. Generates sequential MAC addresses for the switch ports, matching their IP address.
",,b,a,,The --mac flag used in Mininet generates random MAC addresses for the hosts. This helps in avoiding conflicts and ensuring uniqueness in the MAC addresses assigned to the hosts.,['https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Introduction-to-Mininet#creating-topologies'],0,3_mininet_setup,0.9,0.5532100402238672,0.0
20,"What is the purpose of dpctl, provided with mininet?","a. To enable visibility and control over a single switchâ€™s flow table.
b. Is an OpenFlow controller.
c. To enable visibility and control over multiple switch flow table.
",,a,a,,"The purpose of dpctl, provided with Mininet, is to enable visibility and control over a single switch's flow table. It allows users to interact with the OpenFlow switches in the Mininet network by querying and modifying the flow table entries of a specific switch.",['https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Introduction-to-Mininet#interacting-with-switches'],1,3_mininet_setup,0.9,0.999748943549946,1.0
