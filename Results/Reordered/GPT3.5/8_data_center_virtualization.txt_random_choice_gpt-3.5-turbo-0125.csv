d. One way to slice networks is according to “flow space”, whereby different controllers might control distinct and non-overlapping traffic flows.
e. Multi-tenant datacenters are one use case for network slicing.
",,"b,d,e","a,b,d,e",,"The correct statements regarding network slicing are as follows:
 a. A controller can prevent one network slice from interfering with the resources of another: This is true as one of the key features of network slicing is the ability to isolate and control resources for different slices.
 b. Network operators can use slicing to test configurations on “shadow” networks that mirror a production network topology: This is true as network slicing allows for the creation of isolated virtual networks for testing purposes.
 d. One way to slice networks is according to “flow space”, whereby different controllers might control distinct and non-overlapping traffic flows: This is true as network slicing can be implemented based on different criteria such as traffic flows.
 e. Multi-tenant datacenters are one use case for network slicing: This is true as network slicing enables the creation of separate virtual networks for different tenants in a multi-tenant environment.",[],0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,0.501553699791514,0.6000000000000001
63,Which of the following are true about flow spaces? Select all that apply.,"a. Flow spaces can only be defined according to combinations of packet header fields.
b. Two controllers that write data-plane rules for non-overlapping parts of flowspace can never cause traffic from one “slice” to enter the other slice.
c. Two flow spaces cannot overlap.
d. Flowspace isolation separates individual virtual networks from one another but incurs some performance penalty for doing so.
e. One host could send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces.

64,Which of the following describe the control-plane checks that FlowVisor implements? Select all that apply.,"a. When a packet must be forwarded to a controller, Flowvisor forwards traffic to the correct controller based on which controller “owns” the flowspace corresponding to that packet.
b. Flowvisor can only instantiate network slices based on the network topology, not based on other properties, such as application traffic.
c. Flowvisor prevents a controller from writing data-plane rules to a part of flowspace that it does not own.
d. Flowvisor installs traffic shaping and quality of service rules to ensure that each network slice has guaranteed resources.
e. Flowvisor prevents each slice's controller from being the target of a denial of service attack from other slices.
",,"a,c","a,c,e",,"FlowVisor is a key component in Software Defined Networking (SDN) environments that enables multiple controllers to operate on the same physical network without interfering with each other. The control-plane checks that FlowVisor implements include: 

a. When a packet must be forwarded to a controller, FlowVisor forwards traffic to the correct controller based on which controller 'owns' the flowspace corresponding to that packet. This ensures that each controller only deals with the traffic it is responsible for, maintaining isolation and security.

b. FlowVisor can instantiate network slices based on various properties, including network topology and application traffic, not limited to just the network topology. This makes the network slicing process more flexible and customizable.

c. FlowVisor prevents a controller from writing data-plane rules to a part of flowspace that it does not own. This restriction ensures that controllers cannot interfere with each other's traffic handling, enhancing network security and stability.

d. FlowVisor does not typically handle traffic shaping and quality of service rules for network slices. These functions are usually managed by the controllers or other network devices.

e. FlowVisor prevents each slice's controller from being the target of a denial of service attack from other slices. This security measure helps in maintaining the integrity and availability of the controllers and their respective network slices.",[],0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,0.9985279732185246,0.6000000000000001
