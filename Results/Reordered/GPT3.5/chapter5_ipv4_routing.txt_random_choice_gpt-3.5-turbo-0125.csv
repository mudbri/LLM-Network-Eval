91,You have noticed that a server with IP 145.45.3.2 doesn’t respond to requests. What command will you type first in order to test connectivity between your device and the server?,"a. ping 145.45.3.2
b. request 145.45.3.2
c. ping 145.45.3.2
d. check 145.45.3.2
",,a,a,,The correct command to test connectivity between your device and the server with IP 145.45.3.2 is the 'ping' command. The 'ping' command sends ICMP echo packets to the specified IP address and waits for a response. This helps in determining if the server is reachable and responsive.,[],1,chapter5_ipv4_routing,0.95,0.9997549022413644,1.0
92,"A LAN design uses a Layer 3 EtherChannel between two switches SW1 and SW2, with port-channel interface 1 used on both switches. SW1 uses ports G0/1 and G0/2 in the channel. However, only interface G0/1 is bundled into the channel and working. Think about the configuration settings on port G0/2 that could have existed before adding G0/2 to the EtherChannel. Which answers identify a setting that could prevent IOS from adding G0/2 to the Layer 3 EtherChannel? (Choose two answers.)","a. A different STP cost (spanning-tree cost value)
b. A default setting for switchport (switchport)
c. A different speed (speed value)
d. A different access VLAN (switchport access vlan vlanid)
",,"b,c","a,c",,"a. A different STP cost (spanning-tree cost value): If the STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) cost on port G0/2 is different from G0/1, it can prevent the addition of G0/2 to the EtherChannel. STP cost plays a crucial role in determining the path selection in a switched network.
c. A different speed (speed value): If the speed configuration on G0/2 is different from G0/1, it can lead to G0/2 not being added to the EtherChannel. The interfaces in an EtherChannel must have the same speed and duplex settings for proper operation.",[],0,chapter5_ipv4_routing,0.9,0.8842445308391854,0.0
93,"A network engineer has configured a Layer 3 switch with SVIs for VLANs 4 and 5. Hosts in the subnets using VLANs 4 and 5 can ping each other with the Layer 3 switch routing the packets. The next week, the network engineer receives a call that those same users can no longer ping each other. If the problem is with the Layer 3 switching function, which of the following could have caused the problem? (Choose two answers.)","a. VTP on the switch removing VLAN 5 from the switch’s VLAN list
b. 1 out of 10 working VLAN 4 access ports failing due to physical problems
c. A shutdown command issued from VLAN 4 configuration mode
d. A shutdown command issued from VLAN 6 configuration mode
",,"a,c","a,c",,"Option a could have caused the problem because if VLAN 5 was removed from the switch's VLAN list due to VTP, then the SVI for VLAN 5 would also have been removed, leading to the inability of hosts in VLAN 5 to communicate. Option c could also be a reason for the issue as issuing a shutdown command from VLAN 4 configuration mode could disable the VLAN 4 SVI, thus preventing hosts in VLAN 4 from communicating.",[],1,chapter5_ipv4_routing,0.9,0.6778167281810896,1.0

b. show route table
c. show ip route
d. show routing table
",,c,c,,The correct command to list the router's entire routing table in Cisco IOS is 'show ip route'. Option a ('show route') is incorrect as there is no direct command 'show route' in Cisco IOS.

97,The commands ping and traceroute send messages in the network to test connectivity and rely on other devices to send back a reply,"a. FALSE
b. TRUE
",,b,b,,"The statement is TRUE. Both the ping and traceroute commands are used to test connectivity in a network. Ping sends ICMP echo request messages to the destination device, and the destination device sends back an ICMP echo reply if it is reachable. Traceroute sends packets with increasing TTL values to trace the route to the destination and relies on intermediate devices to send back ICMP time exceeded messages, helping to map the network path.",[],1,chapter5_ipv4_routing,0.95,0.9974148430882172,1.0
