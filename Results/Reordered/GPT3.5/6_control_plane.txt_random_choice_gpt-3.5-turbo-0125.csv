43,Which of the following statements are true about the OpenFlow specification? Select all that apply.,"a. If a switch does not contain a flow table entry that matches a particular packet, the switch forwards the packet to the controller for handling.
b. The main purpose of the OpenFlow control channel is to update flow table entries on switches.
c. Once a switch has sent one packet for a flow, it must also send all subsequent packets for that flow to the controller.
d. The OpenFlow specification provides mechanisms to perform Layer 2 learning across a network of switches.
e. Some versions of the OpenFlow specification allow for performing more than one action on a single packet.

47,Which of the following are true about Pox? Select all that apply.,"a. Pox's _handle_PacketIn function determines how a packet should be handled when it arrives at the controller.
b. Pox automatically determines the priority between two conflicting rules.
c. Pox's performance is typically slower than NOX.
d. Pox provides a function to modify flow table entries at a switch.
e. Pox automatically determines the order to install flow table rules, to avoid inconsistent forwarding behavior.
",,"a,c,d","a,d",,"a. Pox's _handle_PacketIn function determines how a packet should be handled when it arrives at the controller. This is true as Pox uses the _handle_PacketIn function to manage incoming packets and decide how to handle them within the SDN network. d.

48,What is the difference between a hard timeout and an idle timeout?,"a. A hard timeout expunges all flow table entry from the switch, whereas an idle timeout only expunges one flow at a time.
b. A hard timeout expunges a flow table entry for all switches in the network, whereas an idle timeout only expunges the flow table entry on the switches that have seen no matches for that flow within the specified interval.
c. A hard timeout occurs exactly at the specified interval, whereas an idle timeout may occur slightly later than the specified interval.
d. A hard timeout expunges a flow table entry regardless of whether there have been active matches, whereas an idle timeout expunges the flow table entry only if there have been no matches for that flow within the specified interval.
