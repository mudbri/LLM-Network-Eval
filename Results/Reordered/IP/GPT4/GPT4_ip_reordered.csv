28,A Layer 2 switch configuration places all its physical ports into VLAN 2. The IP addressing plan shows that address 175.28.1.150 (with mask 255.255.255.0) is reserved for use by this new LAN switch and that 175.28.1.254 is already configured on the router connected to that same VLAN. The switch needs to support SSH connections into the switch from any subnet in the network. Which of the following commands are part of the required configuration in this case? (Choose two answers.),"a. The ip default-gateway 175.28.1.254 command in global configuration mode.
b. The ip address 175.28.1.150 255.255.255.0 command in interface vlan 2 configuration mode.
c. The ip address 172.16.2.250 255.255.255.0 command in interface vlan 1 configuration mode.
d. The ip default-gateway 175.28.1.150 command in global configuration mode.
e. The switch cannot support SSH because all its ports connect to VLAN 2, and the IP address must be configured on interface VLAN 1.
",,"a,b","a,b",,"To enable SSH access to a Layer 2 switch from any subnet in the network, the switch must have an IP address assigned to it and a default gateway set. The IP address should be configured on a VLAN interface that corresponds to the VLAN where the switch's ports are assigned. Since all ports are in VLAN 2, the switch's VLAN 2 interface should be assigned the IP address. The IP address 175.28.1.150 with the subnet mask 255.255.255.0 is reserved for the switch, so it should be configured on the VLAN 2 interface. The default gateway should be set to the IP address of the router's interface that is connected to VLAN 2, which is 175.28.1.254. This allows the switch to route traffic to other subnets via the router. Option e is incorrect because there is no requirement that the IP address must be on interface VLAN 1. Layer 2 switches can have IP addresses on any VLAN interface for management purposes. Option c is incorrect because the IP address specified does not match the VLAN 2 IP addressing scheme. Option d is incorrect because it sets the default gateway to the switch's own IP address, which is not how routing works.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/smb/switches/cisco-small-business-300-series-managed-switches/smb5043-how-to-configure-a-management-ip-address-on-a-sg300-s.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/16448-default-gateway.html']",1,chapter2_ethernet_lans,1.0,0.9999991359603932,1.0

a. The OSPF process ID is locally significant to the router and does not need to match between neighboring OSPF routers. It is used internally on the router to identify a particular OSPF process.

b. The OSPF Dead interval must match between OSPF neighbors. However, if both routers’ interfaces use the same Dead interval (in this case, 80), this would not prevent them from becoming OSPF neighbors.

c. For OSPF routers to become neighbors, their interfaces must be on the same IP network or subnet. Therefore, having interface IP addresses in the same subnet is a requirement for OSPF neighbors and would not prevent the formation of an OSPF adjacency.

d. Each OSPF router must have a unique Router ID within an OSPF domain. If both routers are configured with the same Router ID, they will not form an OSPF adjacency as OSPF assumes this is a single router due to the Router ID conflict.

- 180.5.38.100/32 is a host route for a single IP address, 180.5.38.100, which does not match the destination IP.
- 180.5.38.64/26 represents the range 180.5.38.64 to 180.5.38.127, which does include the destination IP address.

Since both 180.5.38.64/26 and 180.5.38.96/27 include the destination IP, we must choose the most specific route, which is 180.5.38.96/27 because it has the longer prefix (smaller subnet).
