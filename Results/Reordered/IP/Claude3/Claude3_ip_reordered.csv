",,d,d,,The correct Pyretic rule is (match(srcip=10.0.0.1) >> mod(dstip=10.1.2.3)) + (match(srcip=10.0.0.2) >> mod(dstip=10.2.3.4)). This rule uses the '+' operator to combine two separate match-action pairs. The first pair matches traffic from source IP 10.0.0.1 and modifies the destination IP to 10.1.2.3. The second pair matches traffic from source IP 10.0.0.2 and modifies the destination IP to 10.2.3.4. The '+' operator allows both of these actions to be applied in parallel to the respective traffic flows.,"['https://github.com/frenetic-lang/pyretic/wiki/Language-Basics', 'https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall14/cos561/papers/pyretic13.pdf']",1,12_programming_SDNs,0.9,1,1.0
