b. dynamic NAT
c. policy NAT
d. static PAT
e. static NAT
",,c,c,,"Policy NAT (Network Address Translation) allows the firewall to perform translations based on policies, which can include the destination address as a condition for the NAT rule. This means that translations are not just based on the source address, but can also take into account the destination to which the traffic is going, allowing for more granular control of the NAT process.

b. Usernames, passwords, and credentials must be synchronized with a TACACS+/RADIUS server.
c. Authorization policies that are created with local AAA databases cannot be synchronized and made available to all the devices across the network.
d. While they support accounting, they do not meet the requirements for large persistent storage.
",,a,c,,"Local AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) databases are maintained on individual network devices. The limitation of local AAA databases is that they are not centralized. This means that the authorization policies created on one device do not automatically synchronize with other devices across the network. Administrators would have to manually configure each device with the same policies to ensure consistency, which is not practical in larger networks. This is why centralized solutions like TACACS+ and RADIUS are preferred in enterprise environments. Scalability issues (a) are related to this, but the key limitation is the lack of synchronization, not just the manual entry of credentials. Synchronization with TACACS+/RADIUS (b) is not a limitation of local AAA but a feature of centralized AAA solutions.

Two protocols that rely on TCP and are susceptible to session hijacking are Telnet and HTTP.

a. UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is incorrect because it is a connectionless protocol that does not establish a session, and therefore is not susceptible to session hijacking in the same way TCP is.
b. Telnet uses TCP for communication and is known for being insecure as it transmits data, including passwords, in plain text, making it highly susceptible to session hijacking.
c. HTTP also uses TCP and can be susceptible to session hijacking, where an attacker takes over a user's session by stealing or guessing the session token.
d. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is used for diagnostic and control purposes and does not carry session-based communications, so it is not directly susceptible to session hijacking.
e. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) operates at the link layer of the OSI model and is used for mapping IP network addresses to the hardware addresses used by a data link protocol.

29,Which two techniques would an attacker apply so that a client sends packets to the wrong gateway? (Choose two.),"a. Reflection
b. DNS spoofing
c. ICMP redirect
d. ARP poisoning
",,"c,d","b,d",,"An attacker seeking to redirect a client's packets to a wrong gateway can use various techniques, two of which are DNS spoofing and ARP poisoning. DNS spoofing involves sending false responses to DNS queries, leading the client to resolve domain names to incorrect IP addresses, potentially redirecting traffic to a malicious gateway. ARP poisoning, on the other hand, involves sending false ARP messages over a local area network. This technique associates the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of the legitimate gateway, causing the client to send packets to the attacker instead of the real gateway. Reflection is not a technique used to misdirect traffic to a wrong gateway; it's typically used in amplification attacks to bounce traffic off of a third party and direct it back at a victim. ICMP redirect is a message used to inform a host to use a different gateway for sending packets, but it is not typically used by attackers for the purpose of misdirecting traffic, as modern operating systems do not trust ICMP redirect messages by default.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_spoofing', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/reflection-attack-ddos/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICMP_Redirect_Message']",0,NetSec,0.95,0.9935024020934288,0.0
30,"Which three types of traffic must a security analyst be aware of, because the traffic might be botnet CnC traffic? (Choose three.)","a. RCMP
b. P2P
c. SNMP
d. RTMP
e. IRC
f. DNS
",,"b,e,f","b,e,f",,"Botnet Command and Control (CnC) traffic can utilize various protocols to manage bots from a central point. The protocols chosen are often those that are commonly used on networks to avoid detection. Among the choices given, the following are known to be used for botnet CnC traffic:

b. P2P (Peer-to-Peer): Botnets can use P2P networks to communicate between compromised devices, making the botnet more resilient to take-down efforts because there's no single point of failure.

e. IRC (Internet Relay Chat): Historically, IRC has been a popular choice for botnet CnC because it allows real-time communication and can be controlled easily by botnet operators.

f. DNS (Domain Name System): DNS is sometimes used by botnets for CnC communications due to its ubiquitous nature and the difficulty in differentiating malicious DNS queries from legitimate ones.

The other options (RCMP, SNMP, RTMP) are not typically associated with botnet CnC traffic.

31,What do attackers use to launch an attack on a location without the attack coming directly from the attacker’s location? Select one choice.,"a. Malware that is controlled through CnC
b. Ping of death
c. Direct SYN flood attack
d. Spear phishing
",,a,a,,"Attackers use various techniques to launch attacks on a location without the attack coming directly from their own location. Here's an analysis of the given choices:

a. Malware that is controlled through CnC (Command and Control) servers allows attackers to remotely control malware-infected computers (often referred to as 'bots' or 'zombies') and use them to launch attacks. This way, the attack does not come directly from the attacker's location, but rather from the compromised machines.

b. Ping of death is a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack that involves sending malformed or oversized packets to crash the target system. While it is an attack method, it doesn't inherently involve the use of a third-party location to mask the attacker's location.

c. Direct SYN flood attack is another form of DoS attack that involves sending a large number of SYN requests to a target's system in an attempt to overwhelm it. Like the ping of death, this attack comes directly from the attacker's system or systems under their control, but it doesn't use a third-party location to hide the attacker's location.

d. Spear phishing is a targeted email attack that attempts to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or installing malware. While it could potentially be used to install malware that could be controlled remotely, spear phishing itself is not a method for launching attacks from a remote location; it's a method for initial compromise.

Therefore, the correct answer is 'a', as CnC-controlled malware is a common method used by attackers to launch attacks from compromised systems that are not their own, effectively masking their location.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/what-is-a-command-and-control-server.html', 'https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-015', 'https://www.imperva.com/learn/ddos/syn-flood/', 'https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014']",1,NetSec,0.95,0.999998852758658,1.0

",,e,e,,"An amplification attack is a type of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack where an attacker takes advantage of a protocol's functionality to amplify the volume of data that is sent to a victim's server or network resources. Among the choices given, DNS (Domain Name System) is known to be vulnerable to amplification attacks, particularly because it can be exploited through recursive lookups. In a DNS amplification attack, the attacker sends a small query with a spoofed source IP address (the victim's IP) to a recursive DNS server, which then sends a much larger response to the victim's address, overwhelming the victim's network resources. SMTP, HTTP, and HTTPS do not have the same amplification potential as DNS in their standard use cases.

ARP is used for mapping IP network addresses to the hardware (MAC) addresses used by a data link protocol.
