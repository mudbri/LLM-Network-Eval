",,a,a,,"NTP, which stands for Network Time Protocol, is used for time synchronization between computers on a network. It is designed to synchronize the clocks of computers over a network to a specific time reference. DHCP, or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, is used for dynamically distributing network configuration parameters, such as IP addresses. NAT, or Network Address Translation, is used to remap one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device. ARP, or Address Resolution Protocol, is used for mapping an IP address to a physical machine address that is recognized in the local network.

a. Mesh networking - This is a type of network topology where each node relays data for the network. It can work with or without a central access point, but it doesn't inherently exclude the need for one.

b. Infrastructure mode - This mode involves devices connecting through a central access point, such as a router, which is the opposite of what the question asks for.

c. Ad-hoc mode - Also known as peer-to-peer mode, allows devices to connect directly to each other without the need for a central access point. This is the correct answer.

d. Wi-Fi Direct - Although Wi-Fi Direct allows for direct device-to-device connections without an access point, it is a specific technology standard rather than a general mode of operation. It's not the most accurate answer in this context.
