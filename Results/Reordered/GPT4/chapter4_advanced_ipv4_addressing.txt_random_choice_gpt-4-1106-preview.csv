",,d,b,,"A /18 subnet mask means that the first 18 bits of the 32-bit address are used for the network portion. In dotted decimal notation, this corresponds to 255.255.224.0. Here's how it breaks down: The first two octets are full, so they are 255 each. The third octet has 2^(8-2) = 64 subnets, so the subnet mask for the third octet is 256 - 64 = 192, but since we need 18 bits, we take one more bit to make it 256 - 128 = 128. However, we don't subtract the 128 from 256; the value of the third octet is 128 less than 256, which is 224. The last octet is 0 because no bits are used for the network portion in that octet.","['https://www.ripe.net/about-us/press-centre/understanding-ip-addressing', 'https://www.calculator.net/ip-subnet-calculator.html']",0,chapter4_advanced_ipv4_addressing,1.0,0.9034744303630184,0.0

",,"d,e","a,c",,"For a Class B network, the default subnet mask is 255.255.0.0, which is equivalent to /16. To support 90 subnets, we need enough subnet bits beyond the default 16 bits. To calculate the number of subnet bits required, we can use the formula 2^n >= number of subnets, where n is the number of bits. For 90 subnets, we need at least 7 bits (since 2^6 = 64 and 2^7 = 128). Therefore, we need to add 7 bits to the default 16, which gives us 23 bits for the subnet mask. A /19 subnet mask (which is 255.255.224.0) provides 3 bits for host addresses within each subnet and 7 bits for the subnetting, which is enough to support 128 subnets (2^7).
