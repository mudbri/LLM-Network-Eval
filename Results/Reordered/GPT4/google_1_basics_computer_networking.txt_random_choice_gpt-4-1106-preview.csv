5,On which layer are Ethernet standards and some wireless technologies operating?,"a. The network layer
b. The data link layer
c. The physical layer
d. The transport layer
",,b,"b,c",,"Ethernet standards operate primarily on two layers of the OSI model: the data link layer and the physical layer. The data link layer (Layer 2) is responsible for node-to-node data transfer and error detection and handling. It includes the Ethernet protocol, which defines how network devices can format data for transmission to other network devices on the same network segment. The physical layer (Layer 1) defines the electrical, optical, or wireless transmission of raw bits over a physical medium. It includes specifications for cables, switches, and other hardware. Wireless technologies also operate at these two layers, with the physical layer defining the radio frequency transmission and the data link layer handling communication between devices.

6,Which of these allows connections from many devices and inspects the contents of ethernet protocol data?,"a. A cable
b. A switch
c. A hub
d. A collision domain
",,b,b,,"A switch is a networking device that connects multiple devices together on a computer network. Switches operate at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and use MAC addresses to forward Ethernet frames. Unlike a hub, which simply repeats the signals to all ports, a switch inspects the contents of the Ethernet frames, which includes the MAC addresses, to determine which port to send the frame to. This allows for more efficient use of bandwidth and reduces collisions. A cable is simply a medium for transmitting data and does not inspect the contents. A hub also does not inspect the contents; it broadcasts the data to all connected devices. A collision domain is a network segment where data packets can 'collide' with one another when being sent on a shared medium, which is a characteristic of networks with hubs, not a device that inspects Ethernet protocol data.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/smb/switches/cisco-small-business-200-series-smart-switches/smb5534-how-do-switches-manage-collisions-and-broadcast-or-multicast-tr.html']",1,1_basics_computer_networking,1.0,0.9999981375378344,1.0

c. A more advanced version of a switch
d. A physical layer device that allows connections for many computers at once
",,b,b,,"A router is a device used in networking to forward data packets between computer networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the Internet. Data sent through the internet, such as a web page or email, is in the form of data packets. A router is connected to at least two networks and decides which way to send each data packet based on its current understanding of the state of the networks it is connected to. Option 'b' is the correct choice because it accurately describes the primary function of a router. Options 'a' and 'd' are incorrect because they describe functions related to the physical layer, which is not the layer at which routers operate; routers work at the network layer. Option 'c' is incorrect because a router and a switch operate at different layers of the OSI model, with switches typically working at the data link layer and routers at the network layer.

10,What kind of wiring is in cables that communicate in voltage changes that are received by the receiving device as ones and zeros?,"a. Aluminum
b. Fiber
c. Copper
d. Gold
",,c,c,,"Copper wiring in cables is commonly used for electrical signal transmission, where voltage changes are interpreted as binary data (ones and zeros) by the receiving device. This is the principle behind traditional Ethernet cables (such as Cat5, Cat6), which use copper wires to transmit data. Aluminum and gold are also conductive materials, but they are less commonly used for standard data transmission cables; aluminum is less conductive than copper and is more prone to oxidation, while gold is often used for plating connectors due to its resistance to corrosion but not typically for the actual wires inside the cable. Fiber cables, on the other hand, use light to transmit data and do not rely on voltage changes; they are made of glass or plastic fibers.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_conductor', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_cable']",1,1_basics_computer_networking,0.95,0.9999957534720164,1.0
11,What modulation type is used for computer networks?,"a. Line crimping
b. RJ45
c. Line coding
d. Simplex communication
",,c,c,,"Modulation in the context of computer networks generally refers to the process of varying a signal to encode information for transmission. Line coding is a method of converting digital signals into a form that can be easily sent over a physical medium and is a type of modulation used in the context of computer networking. It includes various schemes like Manchester encoding, NRZ, etc., which are used in different network types and technologies. Choices 'a' and 'b' are not types of modulation; 'a' refers to a physical act of altering a cable, and 'b' is a type of connector used in networking. 'd' refers to a method of communication where the signal only goes in one direction, not a type of modulation.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_code', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation']",1,1_basics_computer_networking,0.95,0.9999998063873689,1.0
12,What is the difference between full duplex and half duplex?,"a. Full duplex allows communications in two directions at the same time; half duplex means that only one side can communicate at a time.
b. Full duplex is a form of simplex communications.
c. Half duplex occurs when hubs are in use; full duplex occurs when switches are in use.
d. Full duplex is slower than half duplex.
",,a,a,,"Full duplex and half duplex refer to the ability of a communication channel to send and receive data. Full duplex allows for simultaneous two-way communication, meaning devices can send and receive signals at the same time. This is common in modern networks, especially with the use of switches that can handle full duplex communication. On the other hand, half duplex means that the communication can only go in one direction at a time, similar to a walkie-talkie where one party must wait for the other to finish transmitting before responding. Choice 'b' is incorrect because full duplex is not a form of simplex communication; simplex is one-way communication only. Choice 'c' is misleading because while it's true that hubs typically operate in half duplex mode and switches in full duplex, the duplex capability is not defined by the use of these devices but by the communication protocol and the network design. Choice 'd' is incorrect because full duplex is not inherently slower than half duplex; in fact, it can be faster as it allows for simultaneous communication.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_(telecommunications)', 'https://www.diffen.com/difference/Full_Duplex_vs_Half_Duplex']",1,1_basics_computer_networking,1.0,1.0,1.0

The categories mentioned in the choices that are types of Twisted Pair Ethernet cables are Foiled Twisted Pair (FTP), Shielded Twisted Pair (STP), and Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP). FTP cables have a foil shield that covers the pairs of wires inside the cable, providing protection against electromagnetic interference. STP cables have shielding that can include a foil around each twisted pair, as well as a metal braid, which provides additional protection against interference. UTP cables are the most common type of Ethernet cables and do not have additional shielding aside from the twisted pairs, which helps to cancel out electromagnetic interference.

This address is used when a frame is intended to be received by all devices on the local network segment. The broadcast frame is sent to all devices because the broadcast address corresponds to all possible MAC addresses on the network. Option b, 00:00:00:00:00:00, is typically used to represent an unassigned or a 'null' MAC address. Option c, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:00, is not a standard address used for any specific purpose in Ethernet networking.

The CRC is a mathematical calculation that the sending device performs on the data in the packet. The receiving device also performs this calculation on the data and compares it to the CRC value provided by the sender. If the values match, it is assumed the data arrived intact; if they do not match, it indicates that an error has occurred during transmission.
