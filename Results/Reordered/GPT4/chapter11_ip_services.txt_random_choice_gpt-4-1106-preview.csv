You are responsible to find out why users are not being able to reach the Internet.","a. Dynamic NAT can't use Standard ACLs
b. The NAT pool does not have enough entries to fulfill the user's requests
c. The cause is not related to dynamic NAT
d. The command output does not provide any clue to identify the problem
",,b,b,,"The output indicates that the NAT pool named 'examsdigest' has a total of 10 addresses available for NAT translation (from 190.1.1.1 to 190.1.1.10) and all of them are allocated (100%). Additionally, there are 'misses' which means that there have been 595 instances where an inside device tried to get a NAT translation but couldn't because there were no available addresses in the NAT pool. This suggests that the NAT pool does not have enough addresses to fulfill all the requests from users trying to reach the Internet, which is why users are not able to connect.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/network-address-translation-nat/4606-nat-limit.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipaddr_nat/configuration/xe-3s/nat-xe-3s-book/iadnat-addr-consv.html']",1,chapter11_ip_services,0.95,0.9999863364673468,1.0

",,a,d,,Cisco IOS defines severity levels to classify log messages based on their importance. The severity levels range from 0 (emergencies) to 7 (debugging).

199,You have been tasked to find out whether the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is enabled globally. Which command will you type?,"a. show running-config
b. show protocols
c. show cdp
d. show interface brief
",,c,a,,"To determine if the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is enabled globally on a Cisco device, you would typically check the running configuration of the device. The 'show running-config' command displays the current configuration of the device, which includes whether CDP is enabled or disabled globally. The other commands do not provide direct information about the global status of CDP. 'show protocols' provides a status of protocols configured on the device but not the global CDP status. 'show cdp' might show CDP information, but typically you need to use 'show cdp interface' to see CDP information on specific interfaces, not the global setting. 'show interface brief' provides a summary of the interface status and does not include CDP information.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/12-2/25ew/configuration/guide/conf/cdp.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/simple-network-management-protocol-snmp/44800-configcdp-44800.html']",0,chapter11_ip_services,0.95,0.986974407963318,0.0

d. NTP
",,d,d,,"The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is designed to synchronize the clocks of computers over a network. NTP uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as its transport layer.

FHRP creates a virtual router or a virtual IP, which is configured as the default gateway on the hosts. If one of the routers fails, the other router(s) participating in the FHRP will take over the role of the failed router, thus maintaining the ability for hosts to send packets off-subnet.

203,Which of the following characteristics of network traffic can be managed by Quality of Service (QoS)? (Choose all that apply),"a. Jitter
b. CoS
c. Delay
d. LLQ
e. Loss
f. Bandwidth
",,"a,c,e,f","a,c,e,f",,"Quality of Service (QoS) is a set of technologies and techniques used to manage network traffic and ensure the efficient operation of a network. The characteristics of network traffic that can be managed by QoS include: a. Jitter - Variations in packet arrival times. QoS can prioritize time-sensitive traffic to reduce jitter. c. Delay - The time it takes for data to travel from source to destination. QoS can minimize delay for critical applications. e. Loss - Packet loss occurs when packets fail to reach their destination. QoS can implement mechanisms to reduce the likelihood of packet loss. f. Bandwidth - The amount of data that can be transmitted in a given amount of time. QoS can allocate bandwidth to ensure that important traffic gets the necessary resources. On the other hand, b. CoS (Class of Service) is a way of managing traffic in a network by grouping similar types of traffic together and treating them as a class with its own level of service priority. It is not a characteristic of traffic but rather a method used within QoS. d.
