- Option (a) has a destination port of 28, which does not match the requirement for a destination port equal to 25.
- Option (b) has a source port condition 'gt 25' which does not match the requirement for the source port to be greater than 10455.
- Option (c) specifies TCP instead of UDP, which does not meet the requirement for a UDP header.
- Option (d) correctly specifies UDP as the protocol, any source IP address, source port greater than 10455, the specific destination IP address 30.3.3.3, and the destination port equal to 25, which matches all the given criteria.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/ios-firewall/23602-confaccesslists.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/sec_data_acl/configuration/15-mt/sec-data-acl-15-mt-book/sec-acl-oview.html']",1,chapter9_ip_acl,1.0,0.99991362587046,1.0
