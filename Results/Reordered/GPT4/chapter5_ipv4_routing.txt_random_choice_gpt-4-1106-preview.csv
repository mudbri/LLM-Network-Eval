91,You have noticed that a server with IP 145.45.3.2 doesn’t respond to requests. What command will you type first in order to test connectivity between your device and the server?,"a. ping 145.45.3.2

It sends ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo request packets to the target host and listens for ICMP echo response replies.

Therefore, the correct command to test connectivity to the server with the IP address 145.45.3.2 is 'ping 145.45.3.2'. Option 'b', 'request', is not a standard command for testing connectivity. Option 'c' is a repeat of option 'a' and should be disregarded as a typographical error.

92,"A LAN design uses a Layer 3 EtherChannel between two switches SW1 and SW2, with port-channel interface 1 used on both switches. SW1 uses ports G0/1 and G0/2 in the channel. However, only interface G0/1 is bundled into the channel and working. Think about the configuration settings on port G0/2 that could have existed before adding G0/2 to the EtherChannel. Which answers identify a setting that could prevent IOS from adding G0/2 to the Layer 3 EtherChannel? (Choose two answers.)","a. A different STP cost (spanning-tree cost value)
b. A default setting for switchport (switchport)
c. A different speed (speed value)
d. A different access VLAN (switchport access vlan vlanid)
",,"b,c","b,c",,"When configuring EtherChannel, all ports in the channel must have consistent settings to ensure they can form the EtherChannel bundle correctly. Specifically, they must have the same speed, duplex mode, and switchport settings (among other configurations). For a Layer 3 EtherChannel, the interfaces should be configured as Layer 3 ports, not as switchports, which are Layer 2 interfaces. Therefore, if interface G0/2 had the default switchport setting, it would be a Layer 2 interface and could not join a Layer 3 EtherChannel. Additionally, a difference in speed between the interfaces would also prevent the EtherChannel from forming, as all interfaces must operate at the same speed to be part of the same EtherChannel bundle.

This would cause inter-VLAN routing to fail for the removed VLAN, making option (a) a correct answer. If a shutdown command is issued from the configuration mode for an SVI, it would administratively disable the SVI, causing the Layer 3 interface for that VLAN to go down and thus stopping routing for that VLAN. This makes option (c) another correct answer. Option (b) is incorrect because a single access port failing would not affect the Layer 3 routing function of the switch, as it would only affect the single host connected to that port.

",,c,c,,"To determine the correct interface for routing packets to the destination IP address 180.5.38.122, we need to find the most specific matching route in the routing table. This is known as the longest prefix match. The most specific route is the one with the longest subnet mask (or the smallest subnet) that still includes the destination IP address.

Here's the breakdown of the routes:
- 180.5.38.100/32 is a host route for a single IP address, 180.5.38.100, which does not match the destination IP.
- 180.5.38.64/26 represents the range 180.5.38.64 to 180.5.38.127, which does include the destination IP address.
- 180.5.37.0/23 represents the range 180.5.36.0 to 180.5.37.255, which does not include the destination IP address.
- 180.5.38.96/27 represents the range 180.5.38.96 to 180.5.38.127, which does include the destination IP address.
- 0.0.0.0/0 is the default route and is less specific than the other routes.

Since both 180.5.38.64/26 and 180.5.38.96/27 include the destination IP, we must choose the most specific route, which is 180.5.38.96/27 because it has the longer prefix (smaller subnet).
