c. Both routers’ interface IP addresses are in the same subnet
d. Both routers’ OSPF process uses router ID 42.42.42.42
",,d,d,,"In OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), certain conditions must be met for two routers to become neighbors and subsequently form an adjacency. These conditions include matching Hello and Dead intervals, being in the same subnet, and having a unique OSPF Router ID. Let's evaluate the given choices:

a. The OSPF process ID is locally significant to the router and does not need to match between neighboring OSPF routers. It is used internally on the router to identify a particular OSPF process.

b. The OSPF Dead interval must match between OSPF neighbors. However, if both routers’ interfaces use the same Dead interval (in this case, 80), this would not prevent them from becoming OSPF neighbors.

c. For OSPF routers to become neighbors, their interfaces must be on the same IP network or subnet. Therefore, having interface IP addresses in the same subnet is a requirement for OSPF neighbors and would not prevent the formation of an OSPF adjacency.

d. Each OSPF router must have a unique Router ID within an OSPF domain. If both routers are configured with the same Router ID, they will not form an OSPF adjacency as OSPF assumes this is a single router due to the Router ID conflict.

Therefore, the correct answer that would prevent the two routers from becoming OSPF neighbors is having the same OSPF Router ID.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/open-shortest-path-first-ospf/13689-11.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/open-shortest-path-first-ospf/13685-13.html']",1,chapter6_ospf_routing_protocol,1.0,0.9968766052780048,1.0
