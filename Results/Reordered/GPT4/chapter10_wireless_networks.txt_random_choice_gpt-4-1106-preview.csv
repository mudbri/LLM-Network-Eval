b. Redundancy management
c. Management interface
d. Service port interface
e. Dynamic interface
",,e,e,,"In Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) configurations, a dynamic interface is used to map a WLAN (Wireless LAN) to a VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network).

Here's a brief evaluation of the other choices:
a. Virtual interface - Typically used for controller management traffic and not for mapping WLANs to VLANs.
b. Redundancy management - This is related to high availability and redundancy configurations, not VLAN mapping.

b. SSH
c. HTTP
d. None of the above
e. HTTPS
",,e,e,,"When connecting to a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) for configuration purposes, security is paramount. FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is not typically used for configuring a WLC, and while it can be used for transferring files, it is not secure as it transmits data in clear text. SSH (Secure Shell) is a secure method for command-line access but is not used for GUI (Graphical User Interface) access. HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is used for web-based access but is also not secure as it does not encrypt the traffic, which could expose sensitive information to potential eavesdropping. HTTPS (HTTP Secure), on the other hand, is the secure version of HTTP, which encrypts the traffic between the client and the server, thus providing a secure way to access the WLC GUI and configure a new WLAN.
