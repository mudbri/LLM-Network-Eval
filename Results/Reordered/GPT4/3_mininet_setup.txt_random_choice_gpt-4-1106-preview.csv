16,Which of the following command is used to generate an OpenFlow network topology consisting of a single switch and 8 hosts with randomly generated MAC addresses for each host?,"a. sudo mn --topo single,3 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
b. sudo mn --topo single,8  --switch ovsk --controller remote
c. sudo mn --topo linear,8  --switch ovsk --controller remote
d. sudo mn --topo single,8 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
",,b,d,,"The Mininet command 'sudo mn' is used to create a network topology in a Software Defined Networking (SDN) environment. The '--topo' flag specifies the topology type and the number of nodes. The 'single,8' argument indicates a single switch connected to 8 hosts. The '--mac' flag ensures that Mininet generates random MAC addresses for each host, which is a requirement mentioned in the question. The '--switch ovsk' option specifies the use of the Open vSwitch kernel switch, and '--controller remote' tells Mininet to use a remote controller rather than the default controller. Option (d) is the only command that includes all the required elements: a single switch topology with 8 hosts, randomly generated MAC addresses, the use of Open vSwitch, and a remote controller.","['http://mininet.org/', 'http://mininet.org/walkthrough/']",0,3_mininet_setup,1.0,0.9999971839107652,0.0
17,What is the purpose of --mac flag used in mininet?,"a. Generates random MAC addresses for the hosts.
b. Generates sequential MAC addresses for the hosts, matching their IP address.
c. Generates random MAC addresses for the switch ports.
d. Generates sequential MAC addresses for the switch ports, matching their IP address.
",,b,b,,"The --mac flag in Mininet is used to generate MAC addresses for the hosts that are sequential and correspond to their IP addresses. This simplifies the process of identifying hosts within the network because there is a direct correlation between the IP addresses and the MAC addresses. Option 'a' is incorrect because the MAC addresses are not random when using the --mac flag. Option 'c' is not applicable because the flag is for host MAC addresses, not switch ports. Option 'd' is incorrect because it mentions switch ports, which are not affected by the --mac flag.","['http://mininet.org/api/classmininet_1_1cli_1_1CLI.html', 'http://mininet.org/walkthrough/']",1,3_mininet_setup,0.95,0.9942165722805196,1.0
20,"What is the purpose of dpctl, provided with mininet?","a. To enable visibility and control over a single switchâ€™s flow table.
b. Is an OpenFlow controller.
c. To enable visibility and control over multiple switch flow table.
",,a,a,,"The dpctl utility is a command-line tool provided with Mininet, an SDN network emulator, which allows users to interact with OpenFlow switches. It is used to manage and inspect the flow tables of individual switches. It does not act as an OpenFlow controller, which is responsible for the overall control of multiple switches in the network. Therefore, option 'a' is correct as it specifies that dpctl is used for visibility and control over a single switch's flow table. Option 'b' is incorrect because dpctl is not a controller, and option 'c' is incorrect because dpctl typically operates on individual switches rather than multiple switches simultaneously.","['https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Introduction-to-Mininet#using-mininet', 'https://github.com/mininet/mininet/blob/master/mininet/cli.py', 'https://openflow.stanford.edu/display/ONL/POX+Wiki#POXWiki-dpctl']",1,3_mininet_setup,0.95,0.9981406846723204,1.0
