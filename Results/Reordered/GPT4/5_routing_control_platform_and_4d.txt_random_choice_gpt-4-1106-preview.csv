32,What are some of the reasons that it is difficult to deploy improvements to BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. Changes are necessarily incremental because of the large installed base of routers that already run BGP.
b. Deploying changes requires coordination in standards bodies such as the IETF.
c. BGP is implemented in hardware, so deploying changes to BGP requires changes on the timescale of hardware development cycles.
d. Deplyoing changes to BGP requires coordination across potentially tens of thousands of ASes in the Internet.
e. Only a few vendors implement BGP, and deploying changes requires convincing those vendors to change the protocol.
",,"a,b,d","a,b,d",,"The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a core part of the internet's infrastructure, and making changes to it is inherently complex due to several factors. First, BGP has a large installed base of routers, meaning that any changes need to be incremental to ensure compatibility across the network (a). Second, BGP is a standardized protocol, and any changes to it require coordination and agreement within standards bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) (b). Lastly, BGP changes need to be coordinated across a vast number of Autonomous Systems (ASes), which can number in the tens of thousands, making widespread changes logistically challenging (d). The claim that BGP is implemented in hardware (c) is not always true; while some routers might have hardware components optimized for BGP, the protocol itself is implemented in software, and updates do not necessarily require hardware development cycles. Regarding the number of vendors (e), there are actually many vendors that implement BGP, and while vendor cooperation is necessary for changes, the protocol's ubiquity means that no small group of vendors can control its deployment.","['https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bgp', 'https://www.ietf.org/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol']",1,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.95,0.9322790953704722,1.0

b. In an RCP deployment, routers no longer have to compute routes.
c. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, a single AS can benefit from deploying RCP even if no other ASes deploy RCP.
d. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, the RCP controller for an AS sees all routes for all destinations that an AS learns from neighboring ASes.
e. The RCP controller operates just like a route reflector would, selecting a single best route for each destination for all client routers.

a. Incorrect. Even with RCP, Autonomous Systems (ASes) still need to use BGP to exchange routes with each other. RCP does not replace BGP; instead, it centralizes the control of routing decisions.

b. Correct. Routers in an RCP deployment offload the route computation task to the RCP controller. The RCP controller computes the routes and provides them to the routers. This centralization can simplify the routers' operation and improve network-wide visibility and control.

c. Correct. A single AS can benefit from deploying RCP even if no other ASes deploy RCP. The centralization of routing decisions within a single AS can improve routing efficiency and policy enforcement within that AS.

d. Correct. The RCP controller for an AS can see all routes for all destinations that an AS learns from neighboring ASes. This comprehensive view is part of what enables the RCP to make more informed routing decisions.

e. Incorrect. The RCP controller does more than what a route reflector would do. While a route reflector selects a single best route, the RCP controller has a broader role that includes the computation of routes and potentially optimizing them based on a wider set of criteria than BGP would on its own.","[""Feamster, Nick, et al.

b. Implementing network-wide policy sometimes causes the routers themeselves to have to carry state.
c. BGP's interaction with the underlying routing IGP routing protocol can result in persistent forwarding loops.
d. It is not possible to perform traffic engineering with conventional BGP.
e. Each router operates and makes decisions based only on a local view of network state.
",,"b,c,e","b,c,e",,"In the absence of a Routing Control Platform (RCP), network management with BGP has the following characteristics:

a. BGP routing does not necessarily have a single point of failure. BGP is a distributed protocol, and the failure of a single BGP router does not necessarily cause the entire BGP routing system to fail. Therefore, this statement is false.

b. Implementing network-wide policies can indeed cause routers to carry additional state. This is because BGP routers need to maintain policy information and state for each route they manage. Hence, this statement is true.

c. BGP's interaction with the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) can result in persistent forwarding loops. This is because BGP selects routes based on path attributes and may not be aware of IGP metrics or topology changes, leading to suboptimal routing decisions that could cause loops. Therefore, this statement is true.

d. It is possible to perform traffic engineering with conventional BGP to some extent by manipulating BGP attributes such as AS path, local preference, and MED. However, traffic engineering may be more complex and limited compared to using an RCP. This statement is false.

e. Each router in BGP makes decisions based on its local view of the network state, which includes the routes advertised by its neighbors. BGP does not have a full network-wide view, which can lead to suboptimal routing decisions.

b. The second phase of deployment requires fewer BGP sessions at the RCP controller than the first phase, thus improving scalability of the controller.

Here's an analysis of the given options in the context of the second phase of RCP deployment:

a. The second phase of RCP deployment can indeed offer potential benefits such as reduced routing table size because of the centralized nature of routing control, which can aggregate routes and reduce redundancy.

b. The number of BGP sessions at the RCP controller in the second phase is not specified as being fewer than the first phase in the question. The scalability of the controller is not directly tied to the number of BGP sessions in this context.

c. The second phase of RCP deployment would likely require coordination with neighboring ASes (Autonomous Systems) because it involves routing decisions that affect traffic flow between ASes.

d. ASes still need to use BGP or another routing protocol to exchange routes with one another, even if they are using an RCP controller, as the RCP controller is managing the routing decisions, not the exchange of routing information itself.

e.

Here's an evaluation of each choice in relation to the decision plane's role in amortizing system overhead:

a. Performing inbound traffic engineering on a set of links in a coordinated fashion allows for centralized control and optimization of traffic flows, which can lead to more efficient use of network resources and reduced overhead in managing traffic at individual routers.

b. Secure BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) involves cryptographic operations which can be resource-intensive. Centralizing this function can reduce the overhead on individual routers, as the decision plane can handle the verification of signatures on AS paths more efficiently.

c. Maintaining a single table of AS paths in memory across all BGP sessions in an Autonomous System (AS) is an example of data deduplication, which can significantly save memory resources across the network. This is a key advantage of having a centralized decision plane.

d. Centralized route computation can optimize routing decisions and reduce the computation required on individual routers, thereby saving processing power and memory on those routers.

e. Keeping track of topology information is a task associated with the discovery plane, not the decision plane.
