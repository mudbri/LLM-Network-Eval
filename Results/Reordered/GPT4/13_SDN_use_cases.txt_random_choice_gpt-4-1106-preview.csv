95,What are some benefits to using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Host configuration is simpler, since all hosts are visible from a single large Ethernet topology.
b. Load balancing is easier on a layer-2 topology than on a layer 3 topology.
c. Forwarding on physical MAC addresses is simpler, since both the data center network topology and hosts' physical MAC addresses are hierarchical.
d. IP routing does not need to be reconfigured when physical or virtual machines move from one part of the network to another.
e. Scaling problems are simpler, since all hosts are configured on a single, flat topology.
",,"a,d","a,d",,"a. Host configuration is indeed simpler in a layer-2 MAC topology because all hosts appear to be on the same LAN. This makes management and configuration less complex compared to a scenario where multiple IP subnets and routing are involved.

b. Load balancing can be performed on both Layer 2 and Layer 3 topologies, and it's not necessarily easier on Layer 2. In fact, Layer 3 load balancing can provide more sophisticated traffic management and routing based on IP addresses and can be more scalable.

c. Forwarding on physical MAC addresses is not necessarily simpler with a hierarchical structure. MAC addresses are flat, not hierarchical, and they don't reflect the physical or logical topology of the network. They are used for local delivery within the same broadcast domain.

d. IP routing does not need to be reconfigured when machines move because, in a Layer 2 network, the IP subnet remains the same across the data center. This is especially beneficial for virtual machine mobility and for services that need to maintain IP address consistency.

e. Scaling problems are not necessarily simpler with a single, flat topology. In fact, large flat Layer 2 networks can lead to issues with broadcast traffic and can become difficult to manage and troubleshoot due to the lack of segmentation. Hierarchical network designs with Layer 3 routing can actually be more scalable and manageable.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise/design-zone-data-centers/design-guide-content/layer2-layer3-design.html', 'https://www.networkcomputing.com/data-centers/understanding-layer-2-3-4-protocols', 'https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/layer-2-switching/topics/concept/layer-2-services-overview.html']",1,13_SDN_use_cases,0.95,0.8438709145989506,1.0
96,"In PortLand, what are the reasons for assigning hosts pseudo-MAC addresses, as opposed to simply forwarding traffic on physical MAC addresses? Select all that apply.","a. Hosts in the data-center network topology are more vulnerable to attack if they expose their actual physical MAC addresses, rather than having a layer of indirection.
b. Forwarding loops are be more common in a flat layer-2 topology than they are in a topology with hierarchical pseudo MAC addresses.
c. In a flat layer-2 topology, switches cannot know on which port to forward traffic without maintaining switch tables for each MAC address, since MAC addresses are flat, not hierarchical.
d. Without pseudo-MAC addresses, switches would have to update forwarding state whenever hosts with a particular MAC address moved from one portion of the topology to another.
e. It is very difficult to load balance traffic using physical MAC addresses; pseudo MAC addresses make it possible to assign traffic to destination IP addresses.
",,"c,d","a,b,c,d",,"PortLand is a scalable, fault-tolerant layer 2 data center network fabric designed to support arbitrary network topologies. The use of pseudo-MAC addresses in PortLand serves multiple purposes: 

a. By assigning pseudo-MAC addresses, PortLand provides a layer of indirection that can help hide the physical MAC addresses of hosts, potentially improving security by making it harder for attackers to directly target specific hosts. 

b. Hierarchical addressing using pseudo-MACs helps to prevent forwarding loops that can occur in a flat layer-2 network. In flat networks, since every switch must know the location of every MAC address, there is a higher risk of loops without careful management. 

c. Pseudo-MAC addresses are hierarchical and can be used to indicate the location of a host within the topology, unlike flat physical MAC addresses. This can reduce the size of switch tables as the switch needs only to know about the topology's structure rather than the individual MAC address of every host. 

d. Pseudo-MAC addresses help maintain forwarding state consistency across the network. When a host moves, its pseudo-MAC can remain the same even if its physical location changes, avoiding the need for switches to constantly update their forwarding tables. 

e. The statement about load balancing is not directly related to the use of pseudo-MAC addresses. While pseudo-MAC addresses can be used in conjunction with IP addresses for load balancing, it is not the primary reason for their use in PortLand.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_(networking)', 'https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sigcomm09/tech/full_papers/niranjan_mysore.pdf']",0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.95,0.6491694226476978,0.1999999999999999
97,What are the steps involved in the Proxy ARP process that PortLand's Fabric Manager runs?,"a. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns returns PMAC directly to the end host.
b. Host sends ARP query, fabric manager intercepts ARP query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to end host.
c. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to the host.
d. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch returns PMAC to end host.
e. Edge switch sends ARP query to fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch updates its local PMAC mapping table.
",,d,d,,"The Proxy ARP process in the context of PortLand's Fabric Manager works as follows: The host sends an ARP query to resolve an IP address to a MAC address. The edge switch that the host is connected to intercepts this ARP query. Instead of broadcasting it to all ports, the edge switch redirects the query to the Fabric Manager. The Fabric Manager then looks up the Physical MAC (PMAC) address in its PMAC mapping table. Once the Fabric Manager has the correct PMAC, it returns this information to the edge switch. Finally, the edge switch sends the PMAC back to the end host. This process helps in reducing ARP broadcast traffic within the network and also in maintaining a consistent view of the MAC address table within the fabric.","[""N.

98,"What are some of the disadvantages of today's interdomain routing protocol, BGP? Select all that apply.","a. ISPs can only influence the routing decisions of their immediate neighbor, not the entire end-to-end path.
b. ISPs cannot load-balance traffic across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix.
c. ISPs cannot express preference of one route over another, given multiple routes to a destination.
d. Routing and forwarding decisions are only based on IP prefix, not on a broader range of traffic flow attributes.
e. ISPs can only influence route selection through indirect mechanisms (e.g., prepending), rather than directly manipulating the forwarding table entries in switches.
",,"a,d,e","a,b,d,e",,"BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol, has several limitations that are well-documented within the networking community. Here's an evaluation of each choice provided:

a. True. In BGP, ISPs can indeed only influence the routing decisions of their immediate neighbors through policies and advertisements. They cannot dictate the entire end-to-end path, as BGP is a decentralized protocol and routing decisions are made independently by each autonomous system (AS) along the path.

b. True. BGP does not natively support multi-path load balancing. It selects a single best path for each IP prefix. While there are extensions and techniques to achieve some level of load balancing, it is not a straightforward feature of BGP.

c. False. ISPs can express preference of one route over another by using BGP attributes like Local Preference, AS Path length, and others to influence route selection.

d. True. BGP makes routing decisions based on IP prefixes and path attributes. It does not consider a broader range of traffic flow attributes like the type of traffic, QoS requirements, or other granular details.

e. True. ISPs influence route selection in BGP through indirect mechanisms like AS path prepending, setting local preference, or community strings. They cannot directly manipulate the forwarding table entries in switches that are not under their administrative control.

101,What are some of the features that an SDX enables that today's IXPs cannot support? Select all that apply.,"a. Application-specific peering
b. Wide-area load balancing using IP packet rewriting
c. Application of different business relationships across different regions of the world (e.g., peering only in a specific geographic region).
d. On-the-fly redirection to middleboxes
e. Wide-area load balancing using DNS-based redirection
",,"a,b,d","a,b,c,d",,"Software Defined Exchange (SDX) brings about a new level of flexibility and programmability to Internet Exchange Points (IXPs). Here's how each option relates to SDX capabilities compared to traditional IXPs:

a. Application-specific peering: SDX enables more granular control over network traffic, allowing for application-specific peering rules that go beyond the capabilities of traditional IXPs.

b. Wide-area load balancing using IP packet rewriting: SDX can manipulate IP packets on-the-fly, enabling wide-area load balancing by changing packet headers, which is not a typical feature of traditional IXPs.

c. Application of different business relationships across different regions of the world (e.g., peering only in a specific geographic region): SDX's programmability allows for the implementation of complex business logic, such as geographic-specific peering arrangements, which are not typically supported by traditional IXPs.

d. On-the-fly redirection to middleboxes: SDX can dynamically redirect traffic to various network services (middleboxes) such as firewalls, load balancers, and intrusion detection systems, a feature not commonly found in today's IXPs.

e. Wide-area load balancing using DNS-based redirection: While SDX can enhance load balancing capabilities, DNS-based redirection is not specific to SDX and can be implemented without SDX technology.

103,What are some of the motivations for applying software defined networking in home networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Better performance, since control decisions can be made from a well-provisioned server, as opposed to an under-provisioned router.
b. More fine-grained control over the forwarding behavior of individual devices as conditions in the network change (e.g., a device uses too much bandwidth or data).
c. Ability to better user interfaces to control home network behavior, independent of the interfaces that ship with home router devices.
d. Ability to allow multiple service providers access to the home network infrastructure for different applications and services.
e. Outsourcing control and management of the home network to a third party.
",,"b,c,d,e","a,b,c,d",,"Software Defined Networking (SDN) in home networks offers several benefits. Option (a) is correct because SDN can centralize control decisions to a powerful server rather than relying on less capable hardware like a traditional router. This centralization can lead to better network performance. Option (b) is also correct as SDN provides more granular control over network traffic, allowing for dynamic adjustments based on current network conditions. Option (c) is accurate because SDN can enable the development of better user interfaces for network management, independent of the limitations of router-provided interfaces. Option (d) is correct because SDN can facilitate multi-tenancy and service differentiation, allowing different service providers to offer services over the same home network infrastructure. Option (e) is not necessarily a motivation for SDN in home networks, as outsourcing control and management is more of a potential use case or service model rather than a motivation for applying SDN.","['https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/software-defined-networking', 'https://www.networkworld.com/article/2182525/what-is-software-defined-networking-.html', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6602305']",0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.95,0.999857152316702,0.1999999999999999
104,"Suppose that an operator of a home network wants to write the following policy:

",,b,b,,"The policy described requires two distinct rules: one to block traffic to Facebook, and another to rate limit BitTorrent traffic conditionally based on VoIP activity. In the context of a policy language for Software Defined Networking (SDN), the '>>' operator is often used to denote a sequence of actions, while the '+' operator is used to denote a parallel composition or conjunction of policies. Therefore, the correct policy should use the '+' operator to ensure that both policies are applied independently and not in a sequence where the second depends on the first. Option (a) incorrectly suggests a sequence where BitTorrent traffic is only rate-limited if the traffic to Facebook is dropped. Option (b) correctly uses the '+' operator to apply both policies independently. Option (c) and (d) incorrectly use the '+' operator inside the parentheses, which does not make sense in the context of the given policy language syntax.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/software-defined-standards/overview/', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-the-definition-of-software-defined-networking-sdn/']",1,13_SDN_use_cases,0.95,0.99994735816263,1.0
