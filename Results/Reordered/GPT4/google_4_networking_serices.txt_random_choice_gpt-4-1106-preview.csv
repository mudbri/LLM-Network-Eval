d. IP masquerading
",,b,b,,"IP exhaustion refers to the depletion of available IPv4 addresses. To address this issue, various solutions have been proposed and implemented. Here's an evaluation of the provided options:

a. RFC1918 - This refers to the standard that allows for the use of private IP address spaces within organizations. While it helps conserve public IP addresses by allowing multiple organizations to use the same private IP ranges internally, it does not create more public IP addresses.

b. IPv6 - This is the new version of the Internet Protocol that significantly increases the number of available IP addresses by using a 128-bit address space, compared to the 32-bit space used by IPv4. This is the correct answer as it creates a vastly larger pool of public IP addresses.

c. Port preservation - This term is not commonly associated with solutions to IP exhaustion. It may be a misinterpretation of 'port address translation' (PAT), which conserves IP addresses by allowing multiple hosts on a private network to share a single public IP address. It does not create new public IP addresses.
