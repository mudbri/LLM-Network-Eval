204,"The customer edge device is typically a router, that sits at a customer site on MPLS networks and connects to a provider edge router (PE router) to take communications from a customer site to a provider side.","a. FALSE
b. TRUE
",,b,b,,"In MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching) networks, the customer edge (CE) device is indeed typically a router that resides at the customer's premises. The CE router interfaces with the provider edge (PE) router, which is part of the service provider's network. The CE router's role is to connect to the PE router and facilitate the transfer of the customer's data into the provider's MPLS network. Therefore, the statement is true.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/net_mgmt/ip_solution_center/5-2/mpls_vpn/user/guide/mpls52book/concepts.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotocol_Label_Switching']",1,chapter12_network_design_architecture,1.0,0.9999989719621284,1.0

b. Hybrid
c. Full Mesh
d. Star
",,c,c,,"A full mesh network design is one where each node in the network has a direct link to every other node. This means that in a full mesh, there is a unique dedicated point-to-point link between every pair of nodes. This is in contrast to a partial mesh, where some nodes are connected to all others, but some are only connected to a few. A hybrid network combines elements of different topologies, which might include mesh elements, but not exclusively. A star topology, on the other hand, connects all nodes to a central hub, not directly to each other.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/cloud-systems-management/network-automation-and-management/200933-Network-Design-Considerations-for-Enterp.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology#Mesh']",1,chapter12_network_design_architecture,1.0,1.0,1.0

b. TRUE

In a PoE-capable network, the LAN switch (or any other network device like an injector) can function as the Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE).

b. Campus
c. Access
d. Distribution
",,c,c,,"In a hierarchical network design, campus switches have different roles based on the layer they are in. The access layer is where end-user devices connect to the network. Access switches provide the connection points for devices such as computers, phones, and printers. The core layer is designed for high-speed backbone connectivity and does not directly connect to end-user devices. The distribution layer aggregates the data from access switches and routes it to the core layer but also does not directly connect to end-user devices.

211,Your company plans to start using public cloud service and now you are considering different WAN options. Your main concern is security by keeping the data private while also providing good QoS services. Which of the following options are under consideration? (Choose two answers.),"a. Using an intercloud exchange
b. Using an Internet connection without VPN
c. Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider
d. Using an Internet connection with VPN
",,"a,c","c,d",,"When considering WAN options for connecting to a public cloud service with a focus on maintaining data privacy and ensuring good Quality of Service (QoS), the following options are viable: 

- Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider (Option c): This approach involves setting up a dedicated, private connection between the company's network and the cloud provider. This ensures that data is not transmitted over the public internet, thereby maintaining privacy and potentially providing better QoS by having a dedicated line.

- Using an Internet connection with VPN (Option d): A VPN (Virtual Private Network) creates a secure, encrypted tunnel over the public internet, which can help to keep data private even when using an internet connection. Additionally, VPNs can offer some level of QoS by prioritizing certain types of traffic.

Option a, 'Using an intercloud exchange,' might be considered for different reasons, such as improving connectivity between different cloud providers, but it does not inherently address the privacy concern. Option b, 'Using an Internet connection without VPN,' does not provide the necessary privacy as the data would be transmitted over the public internet without encryption.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/what-is-a-vpn.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/private-wan/index.html']",0,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,0.999807251325763,0.0

b. TRUE

213,"A company uses a Metro Ethernet WAN with an Ethernet LAN (E-LAN) service, with the company headquarters plus 20 remote sites connected to the service. The enterprise uses OSPF at all sites, with one router connected to the service from each site. Which of the following are true about the Layer 3 details most likely used with this service and design? (Choose all that apply)","a. The WAN uses 20 or more IP subnets
b. A remote site router would have 20 OSPF neighbors
c. A remote site router would have one OSPF neighbor
d. The WAN uses one IP subnet
",,"b,d","a,c",,"In a Metro Ethernet E-LAN service, all sites are connected in a mesh topology, which makes it appear as though they are all on the same Ethernet LAN. This allows all the sites to communicate with each other directly. However, from a Layer 3 perspective, each site would typically be on a different subnet to allow for proper IP routing and management. Hence, the WAN would use 20 or more IP subnets, one for each remote site plus the headquarters, making option (a) correct.

As for OSPF neighbors, each router at a remote site would only form an OSPF adjacency with the headquarters router if OSPF is configured to operate over a single broadcast domain, such as with a hub-and-spoke topology using a single E-LAN service. The routers would not form OSPF adjacencies directly with each other because OSPF treats the entire E-LAN service as a single broadcast domain. Therefore, a remote site router would have one OSPF neighbor, making option (c) correct.

Option (b) is incorrect because in an E-LAN service, each site does not form individual OSPF adjacencies with every other site. Option (d) is incorrect because while the E-LAN service emulates a single Ethernet network, the use of multiple IP subnets is still a common and likely practice for separating traffic between different sites.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Enterprise/WAN_and_MAN/EME.html', 'https://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=680824&seqNum=2', 'https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2328.txt']",0,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,0.6734001900706535,0.0

",,b,b,,"Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a form of cloud computing that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. IaaS is one of the three main categories of cloud services, alongside Software as a Service (SaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS).

The IaaS provider also offers a range of services to accompany those infrastructure components. These can include detailed billing, monitoring, log access, security, load balancing, and clustering, as well as storage resiliency, such as backup, replication, and recovery.
