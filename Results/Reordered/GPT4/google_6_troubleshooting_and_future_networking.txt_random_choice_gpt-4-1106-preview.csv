90,The protocol used to communicate network errors is known as __________.,"a. UDP
b. TCP
c. ICMP
d. Traceroute
",,c,c,,"The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is used for sending error messages and operational information indicating, for example, that a requested service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached. ICMP is a key component of the Internet Protocol Suite. It is used by network devices, like routers, to send error messages and operational information indicating, for example, that a service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached. UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) are both transport layer protocols used for data transmission but do not communicate network errors in the same way ICMP does. Traceroute is a utility that uses ICMP to trace the path from one network to another, but it is not a protocol for communicating network errors.","['https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc792.txt', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceroute']",1,6_troubleshooting_and_future_networking,1.0,1.0,1.0

c. Destination Network Unknown
d. Echo Reply
",,b,b,,"The ping utility is used to test the reachability of a host on an Internet Protocol (IP) network and measures the round-trip time for messages sent from the originating host to a destination computer. The utility sends ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) 'Echo Request' messages to the destination host and listens for 'Echo Reply' messages in response. Therefore, the correct message type sent by the ping utility is 'Echo Request'.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)', 'https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1122.txt']",1,6_troubleshooting_and_future_networking,1.0,1.0,1.0
92,What is one of the tools you can use to verify connectivity to a specific port on Windows OS?,"a. Ping
b. Tracert
c. Test-NetConnection
d. nc (netcat)
",,c,c,,"To verify connectivity to a specific port on a Windows operating system, you can use the 'Test-NetConnection' cmdlet. This cmdlet is a part of the PowerShell environment and allows you to test TCP connections to a specified port. It can provide information about the TCP connection, including whether the port is accessible from your computer. The 'Ping' command (a) is used to test the reachability of a host on an IP network and measures round-trip time, but it does not test connectivity to a specific port. 'Tracert' (b) is another utility that traces the path that an IP packet takes to reach its destination, but again, it does not test specific port connectivity. 'nc' or 'netcat' (d) is indeed a networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP, but it is not natively available on Windows OS and must be installed separately. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Test-NetConnection'.","['https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/nettcpip/test-netconnection', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceroute', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat']",1,6_troubleshooting_and_future_networking,0.95,0.999999091165773,1.0

b. Windows 7
c. Mac Os
d. Linux
",,"c,d","c,d",,"Traceroute is a network diagnostic tool used to track the path that an IP packet takes to reach its destination. On Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and Mac OS, traceroute typically uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) packets to perform its analysis. It sends out UDP packets with a low TTL (Time To Live) value, which causes routers along the path to return an ICMP 'Time Exceeded' message, thereby revealing the route. On the other hand, Windows implements a similar tool called 'tracert' which uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) Echo Request packets instead of UDP packets. This is consistent across various versions of Windows, including Windows 7 and Windows 10.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceroute', 'https://www.lifewire.com/traceroute-linux-command-4092586', 'https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/tracert']",1,6_troubleshooting_and_future_networking,0.95,0.9977601884297675,1.0

b. Addition
c. Subtraction
d. Multiplication
",,c,c,,"During a traceroute operation, each router along the path to the destination decreases the TTL value by 1. The Time To Live (TTL) field in the IP header is used to prevent packets from looping indefinitely in the network. When the TTL field reaches zero, the packet is discarded, and an ICMP 'Time Exceeded' message is sent back to the source.

a. Host - This is a DNS lookup utility, but it is not as universally available on all major desktop operating systems as 'nslookup'. It is most commonly found on Unix-like operating systems.
b. Tracert - This is a command-line utility used to determine the path taken by packets across an IP network (traceroute). It is not used for DNS resolution.
c. Nslookup - This is the correct answer. 'Nslookup' is a network administration command-line tool available for many computer operating systems for querying the Domain Name System to obtain domain name or IP address mapping or other DNS records.
d. Ping - This utility is used to test the reachability of a host on an Internet Protocol (IP) network and to measure the round-trip time for messages sent from the originating host to a destination computer.
