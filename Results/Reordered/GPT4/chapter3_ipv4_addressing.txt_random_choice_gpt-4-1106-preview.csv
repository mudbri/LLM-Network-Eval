",,b,b,,"To determine the number of subnet bits required to create a specific number of subnets, you can use the formula 2^n >= number of subnets, where 'n' represents the number of bits. In this case, we need to find the smallest 'n' such that 2^n is equal to or greater than 5. The smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to 5 is 2^3, which equals 8. Therefore, 3 bits are needed to create at least 5 subnets.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html', 'https://www.ripe.net/participate/member-support/lir-basics/ipv4-subnetting']",1,chapter3_ipv4_addressing,1.0,0.9999856212553752,1.0

",,"a,c,f","a,c,f",,"Private IP addresses are defined by RFC 1918 and are not routable on the internet. They are reserved for use within private networks. The ranges specified by RFC 1918 are as follows:

- 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8)
- 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12)
- 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16)

Evaluating the choices based on these ranges:
a. 172.31.100.0 falls within the 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 range, so it is a private network.
b. 192.166.255.0 does not fall within any of the private IP ranges; it is a public IP address.
c. 172.24.0.0 falls within the 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 range, so it is a private network.
d. 11.11.11.0 does not fall within any of the private IP ranges; it is a public IP address.
e. 164.16.2.0 does not fall within any of the private IP ranges; it is a public IP address.
f. 192.168.1.0 falls within the 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 range, so it is a private network.

Therefore, the correct answers are a, c, and f.","['RFC 1918 - Address Allocation for Private Internets, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918']",1,chapter3_ipv4_addressing,1.0,0.9999994191622188,1.0
