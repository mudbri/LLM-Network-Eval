d. 257.70.312.49
",,"a,c","a,c",,A valid IPv4 address is composed of four octets (each ranging from 0 to 255) separated by periods. Option 'a' (8.8.8.8) and option 'c' (192.168.1.1) are valid IP addresses because all their octets are within the range of 0 to 255. Option 'b' (123.456.123.456) is invalid because the second octet (456) exceeds the maximum value of 255. Option 'd' (257.70.312.49) is also invalid because the first octet (257) and the third octet (312) exceed the maximum value of 255.,['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address'],1,2_networking_layer,1.0,1.0,1.0

b. Class C addresses
c. Class A
d. Class E
",,a,a,,"IP addresses are divided into classes based on the leading bits in the address and the number of octets used for the network ID and host ID. Class A addresses use the first octet for the network ID and the remaining three for the host ID.

Class C addresses use the first three octets for the network ID and the last octet for the host ID. Class D is used for multicast addressing and does not have a network/host division. Class E is reserved for experimental purposes and also does not follow the typical network/host division.

24,The ____ is used to indicate that the datagram is allowed to be fragmented or to indicate that the datagram has already been fragmented.,"a. fragmentation offset field
b. total length field
c. flag field
d. service type field
",,c,c,,"In the context of Internet Protocol (IP), the flag field in the IP header is used to control or identify fragments. It consists of three bits, of which the two relevant bits are used to indicate if a datagram can be fragmented or if it is the last fragment. The first bit is the 'do not fragment' (DF) bit, which when set to 0, indicates that the datagram can be fragmented. When set to 1, it indicates that the datagram should not be fragmented. The second bit is the 'more fragments' (MF) bit, which when set to 0, indicates that this datagram is the last fragment or that the datagram has not been fragmented. When set to 1, it indicates that more fragments are to follow. The fragmentation offset field is used to help piece together fragmented datagrams and is not used to indicate whether a datagram can be fragmented or not. The total length field indicates the total length of the IP packet, including header and data, but does not relate to fragmentation. The service type field (more correctly referred to as the Type of Service or ToS field in IPv4 or the Traffic Class field in IPv6) is used to specify how an upper-layer protocol would like a current datagram to be handled and does not relate to fragmentation.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Flags', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_packet#Fixed_header']",1,2_networking_layer,0.95,0.9858501210326742,1.0

b. MAC addresses
c. IP datagram
d. network
",,d,d,,"The IP address assigned to a device depends on the network it is connected to. IP addresses are logical addresses used to identify devices on a network, and they are typically assigned by the network based on its addressing scheme and subnetting. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used for mapping IP network addresses to the hardware MAC addresses used by a data link protocol. MAC addresses are physical hardware addresses assigned to network interfaces and are not used to assign IP addresses. IP datagrams are the basic unit of information passed across the Internet using the IP, but they do not determine the IP address assignment.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_datagram']",1,2_networking_layer,1.0,0.9998968197434488,1.0

b. 4
c. 2
d. 3
",,b,b,,"A subnet mask is used in IP networking to divide the IP address into a network and host identifier. It is typically expressed in dotted-decimal format, which is the same as an IP address.

b. Link State Routing Protocols
c. Hypertext Transfer Protocol
d. Transmission Control Protocol
",,"a,b","a,b",,"Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) are routing protocols used within an Autonomous System (AS). There are two main types of IGPs based on the algorithm they use for deciding the best path: Distance-Vector Protocols and Link State Routing Protocols. Distance-Vector Protocols, such as Routing Information Protocol (RIP), use distance or hop count as a metric to determine the best path to each network. Link State Routing Protocols, such as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), build a complete map of the topology to compute the shortest paths. On the other hand, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) are not routing protocols. HTTP is an application layer protocol used for transmitting web pages over the internet, while TCP is a core protocol of the Internet Protocol Suite, providing reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets between applications running on hosts communicating over an IP network.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_gateway_protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance-vector_routing_protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-state_routing_protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol']",1,2_networking_layer,1.0,1.0,1.0

d. There is no difference between them.
",,a,a,,"Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) are used for routing within a single autonomous system (AS). They are designed to allow routers within the same AS to exchange routing information with each other. Examples of IGPs include Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), and Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS). On the other hand, Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs) are used to route data between independent autonomous systems. These protocols are designed to allow different ASes to share routing information. The most common EGP in use is the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
