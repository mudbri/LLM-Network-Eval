137,"In a spoofing attack, which of the following parameters are commonly spoofed? (Choose two answers)","a. Routing table
b. MAC address
c. Source IP address
d. ARP address
e. ARP table
f. Destination IP address
",,"b,c","b,c",,"In a spoofing attack, an attacker commonly falsifies information to masquerade as another device or user. Two common parameters that are spoofed in these types of attacks are the MAC address and the Source IP address. Spoofing the MAC address (b) allows an attacker to impersonate another device within the local network segment. Spoofing the Source IP address (c) enables an attacker to send packets that appear to originate from a different IP address, which can be used for various malicious activities, including but not limited to, bypassing access controls and engaging in DoS attacks. The other options, such as the routing table (a), ARP address (d), and ARP table (e), are not typically 'spoofed' but can be manipulated or poisoned in other types of attacks (e.g., ARP poisoning). The Destination IP address (f) is not usually spoofed by an attacker as this would cause the response from the attacked system to be sent to a different destination, thus not reaching the attacker.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_spoofing', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address_spoofing', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing']",1,chapter8_security_fundamentals,0.95,0.9999680987188568,1.0

1. Enter global configuration mode with 'configure terminal'.
2. Select the interface with 'interface FastEthernet0/1'.
3. Set the port to access mode with 'switchport mode access'. This command ensures that the interface will carry traffic for one VLAN only.
