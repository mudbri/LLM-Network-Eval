218,Which of the following configuration management tools uses agentless architecture for managing network devices?,"a. Ansible
b. Ansible and Puppet
c. Puppet
d. Puppet and Chef
e. Chef
",,a,a,,"Ansible is known for its agentless architecture, which means that it does not require any special software to be installed on the nodes (network devices) it manages. Instead, it typically relies on existing SSH or WinRM protocols to execute its configurations. Puppet, Chef, and other tools like SaltStack usually require an agent to be installed on the managed devices to facilitate the management and configuration tasks.","['https://www.ansible.com/overview/how-ansible-works', 'https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/architecture.html', 'https://docs.chef.io/chef_overview/']",1,chapter13_network_automation,0.95,0.9999993295729248,1.0

221,A Layer 2 switch examines a frame’s destination MAC address and forwards that frame out of the port G0/2. That action occurs as part of which plane of the switch?,"a. Control Plane
b. None of the above
c. Data plane
d. Management plane
",,c,c,,"In network device operations, the data plane (also known as the forwarding plane) is responsible for the actual forwarding of packets or frames from one interface to another. When a Layer 2 switch examines a frame's destination MAC address and forwards it out of a specific port, it is performing a data plane function. The control plane is involved in the network's routing logic and makes decisions about where traffic should be sent, but it does not forward the traffic itself. The management plane is used for the maintenance and administration of the network device, typically involving tasks such as configuration management, monitoring, and troubleshooting, which are not related to the forwarding of frames based on MAC addresses.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_plane', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/sw/4_2/nx-os/interfaces/configuration/guide/if_cli/if_basic.html#wp1054048']",1,chapter13_network_automation,1.0,0.9999995679800934,1.0
