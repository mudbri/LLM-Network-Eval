1,Which of the following terms describe Ethernet addresses that can send one frame and is delivered to multiple devices on the LAN? (Choose two answers.),"a. Multicast address
b. Broadcast address
c. Unicast address
d. IP address
e. MAC address
",,"a,b","a,b",,"Ethernet addresses can be classified into different types based on the intended recipients of the frames. A multicast address allows a frame to be sent from one device and delivered to multiple devices. It is typically used for efficient network services that are meant for a group of devices, such as streaming video to multiple recipients. A broadcast address, on the other hand, allows a frame to be sent from one device to all devices on the LAN. This is used for network-wide announcements or for devices seeking information from all others on the LAN, such as when obtaining an IP address via DHCP. A unicast address (c) is used for one-to-one communication, where a frame is sent from one device and delivered to one specific device. An IP address (d) is a logical address used at the Internet layer to identify a device on a network, but it is not specific to Ethernet frames. An MAC address (e) is a physical address used at the data link layer, but the term itself does not imply multicast or broadcast; it can be a unicast, multicast, or broadcast address.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/express-forwarding-cef/13749-12.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_address', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_address']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,1.0,0.9999996871837188,1.0

b. TCP/UDP
c. TCP/IP
d. CSMA/CD
",,d,d,,"CSMA/CD, which stands for Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection, is the set of rules (protocol) used in networks to determine how to proceed when a collision is detected. It is used in traditional Ethernet networks where devices listen for carrier signals and detect collisions on the network. When a collision is detected, the devices that were transmitting will wait a random amount of time and then attempt to resend the transmission. This is in contrast to CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance), which is used in wireless networks like WiFi to prevent collisions before they happen. TCP/UDP (Transmission Control Protocol/User Datagram Protocol) and TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) are not relevant to the collision detection and handling; they operate at different layers of the OSI model.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-sense_multiple_access_with_collision_detection', 'https://www.techopedia.com/definition/2572/carrier-sense-multiple-access-with-collision-detection-csmacd']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,1.0,0.9914446917287688,1.0

6,The host sends packets to its default gateway if the ____________ IP address is in a different subnet than the host.,"a. Destination
b. Unicast
c. Broadcast
d. Source
",,a,a,,"In IP networking, a host determines whether to send packets directly to the destination or to forward them to its default gateway based on the destination IP address. If the destination IP address is within the same subnet as the host, the host will attempt to communicate directly using local network protocols like ARP to resolve the destination's MAC address. However, if the destination IP address is in a different subnet than the host, the host will send the packets to its configured default gateway, which is a router that knows how to forward the packets to other networks. The other choices (unicast, broadcast, and source) are not directly related to the decision of whether to send packets to the default gateway.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/16448-understanding-ip-addressing.html', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_gateway']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,1.0,0.9999995679800934,1.0

d. Learning routes for subnets directly connected to the router

Option 'b' is not a function of a routing protocol but rather a function of the routing process, which uses the routing table to forward packets.
