91,You have noticed that a server with IP 145.45.3.2 doesn’t respond to requests. What command will you type first in order to test connectivity between your device and the server?,"a. ping 145.45.3.2
b. request 145.45.3.2
c. ping 145.45.3.2
d. check 145.45.3.2

92,"A LAN design uses a Layer 3 EtherChannel between two switches SW1 and SW2, with port-channel interface 1 used on both switches. SW1 uses ports G0/1 and G0/2 in the channel. However, only interface G0/1 is bundled into the channel and working. Think about the configuration settings on port G0/2 that could have existed before adding G0/2 to the EtherChannel. Which answers identify a setting that could prevent IOS from adding G0/2 to the Layer 3 EtherChannel? (Choose two answers.)","a. A different STP cost (spanning-tree cost value)
b. A default setting for switchport (switchport)
c. A different speed (speed value)
d. A different access VLAN (switchport access vlan vlanid)
",,"b,c","b,d",,"For a Layer 3 EtherChannel, the physical interfaces must not be configured as switchports (Layer 2 ports). If an interface has the 'switchport' command configured, making it a Layer 2 port, it cannot be added to a Layer 3 port-channel. Similarly, if the interface is configured with 'switchport access vlan' and assigned to a VLAN, it is operating as a Layer 2 port and incompatible with a Layer 3 EtherChannel. The STP cost and port speed do not prevent an interface from being added to a Layer 3 EtherChannel.","['Cisco Press CCNP and CCIE Enterprise Core ENCOR 350-401 Official Cert Guide, Chapter 6: Layer 2 Port Aggregation (EtherChannel)', 'Cisco IOS Network Management Command Reference - channel-group command']",0,chapter5_ipv4_routing,0.95,1,0.0
93,"A network engineer has configured a Layer 3 switch with SVIs for VLANs 4 and 5. Hosts in the subnets using VLANs 4 and 5 can ping each other with the Layer 3 switch routing the packets. The next week, the network engineer receives a call that those same users can no longer ping each other. If the problem is with the Layer 3 switching function, which of the following could have caused the problem? (Choose two answers.)","a. VTP on the switch removing VLAN 5 from the switch’s VLAN list
b. 1 out of 10 working VLAN 4 access ports failing due to physical problems
c. A shutdown command issued from VLAN 4 configuration mode
d. A shutdown command issued from VLAN 6 configuration mode
",,"a,c","a,c",,"The problem could be caused by either VTP removing VLAN 5 from the switch's VLAN list (a) or a 'shutdown' command issued from VLAN 4 configuration mode (c). If VTP removes VLAN 5, the switch will no longer have an SVI for that VLAN, breaking connectivity. Similarly, issuing a 'shutdown' command on the SVI for VLAN 4 will administratively disable the SVI, preventing inter-VLAN routing for hosts in that VLAN. Choice (b) is incorrect because a single access port failure would only impact the host connected to that port, not all hosts in VLAN 4. Choice (d) is incorrect because VLAN 6 is not mentioned as being used, so shutting down its SVI (if it exists) would not impact hosts in VLANs 4 and 5.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Wendell Odom, Chapter 11: Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs', 'CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Wendell Odom, Chapter 18: Configuring and Verifying Inter-VLAN Routing']",1,chapter5_ipv4_routing,0.95,1,1.0
