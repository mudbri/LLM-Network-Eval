",,c,c,,"A Layer 2 redirect or spoofing attack is commonly referred to as an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) attack. In an ARP attack, the attacker sends falsified ARP messages over a local area network to associate their MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate device on the network. This allows the attacker to intercept, modify or drop data frames intended for that IP address, effectively redirecting or spoofing the traffic at the data link layer (Layer 2).","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1 by Wendell Odom (Cisco Press)', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/what-is-arp-spoofing.html']",1,NetSec,0.95,1,1.0
35,Which one of the following options is the illegitimate DHCP server that is referred to in the context of a DHCP server-based attack? Select one choice.,"a. A sitting duck server
b. An erroneous server
c. A rogue DHCP server
d. A target server
",,c,c,,"A rogue DHCP server is an illegitimate DHCP server set up by an attacker to launch a DHCP server-based attack. The rogue server can provide incorrect IP addressing and configuration information to clients, redirecting them to malicious servers or causing network disruption.","['CISSP All-in-One Exam Guide, 8th Edition by Shon Harris and Fernando Maymi, Chapter 4: Communication and Network Security', 'CompTIA Security+ SY0-601 Exam Cram by Diane Barrett and Martin Weiss, Chapter 7: Networking']",1,NetSec,0.95,1,1.0
36,What is one way of mitigating DHCP attacks by using a Cisco switch? Select one choice.,"a. MAC address security
b. DHCP snooping
c. VLAN segmentation
d. DHCP authentication""
",,b,b,,"DHCP snooping is a Cisco switch feature that can help mitigate DHCP attacks. It works by monitoring DHCP messages between DHCP clients and DHCP servers, and filtering out untrusted or rogue DHCP server messages. DHCP snooping builds a binding table to track the MAC addresses, IP addresses, lease times, and ports associated with each DHCP client. This allows the switch to permit valid DHCP traffic while dropping malicious packets from untrusted sources, preventing common DHCP attacks like DHCP starvation or rogue DHCP servers.","['Cisco - Configuring DHCP Snooping (https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst2960x/software/15-2_5_e/configuration_guide/b_1525e_consolidated_2960x_cg/b_1525e_consolidated_2960x_cg_chapter_01001.html)', 'Cisco Press - CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1 by Wendell Odom']",1,NetSec,0.95,1,1.0
