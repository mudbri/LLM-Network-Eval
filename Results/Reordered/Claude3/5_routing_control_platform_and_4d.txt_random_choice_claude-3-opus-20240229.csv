32,What are some of the reasons that it is difficult to deploy improvements to BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. Changes are necessarily incremental because of the large installed base of routers that already run BGP.
b. Deploying changes requires coordination in standards bodies such as the IETF.
c. BGP is implemented in hardware, so deploying changes to BGP requires changes on the timescale of hardware development cycles.
d. Deplyoing changes to BGP requires coordination across potentially tens of thousands of ASes in the Internet.
e. Only a few vendors implement BGP, and deploying changes requires convincing those vendors to change the protocol.

c. Faster innovation
d. Inherent robustness of control plane
e. Improved security.
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c,e",,"The 4D architecture aims to simplify the control plane through several key goals. Simpler routers and switches (a) are achieved by moving control logic to a centralized controller.

b. If secure BGP were deployed, verifying the signatures on the AS paths of routes received from neighbors.
c. Maintaining a single table in memory of AS paths that are learned across all BGP sessions in the AS, and using references into that table for specific routers (and routing decisions), to save memory.
d. Performing route computation on behalf of all the routers in the AS.
e. Keeping track of topology information.

This saves memory compared to each router maintaining its own full table. d) Performing route computation centrally on behalf of all routers in the AS is more efficient than each router doing its own computation.
