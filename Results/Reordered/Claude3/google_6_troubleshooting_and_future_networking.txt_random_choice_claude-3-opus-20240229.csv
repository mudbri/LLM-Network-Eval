90,The protocol used to communicate network errors is known as __________.,"a. UDP
b. TCP
c. ICMP
d. Traceroute
",,c,c,,"ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is used to communicate network errors and operational information between network devices.

91,The ping utility sends what message type?,"a. Destination Network Unreachable
b. Echo Request
c. Destination Network Unknown
d. Echo Reply
",,b,b,,"The ping utility sends ICMP Echo Request messages to the target host and expects ICMP Echo Reply messages back to determine reachability and round-trip time. If the target host is reachable and functioning properly, it will respond to the Echo Request with an Echo Reply. The other options are ICMP error messages that may be returned if there are issues reaching the target host, but they are not the type of message ping itself sends.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)', 'https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc792']",1,6_troubleshooting_and_future_networking,0.95,1,1.0

b. Addition
c. Subtraction
d. Multiplication
",,c,c,,"During a traceroute, each router that receives the packet subtracts one from the Time To Live (TTL) field before forwarding the packet to the next hop. If the TTL reaches zero after subtraction, the router discards the packet and sends an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the source. This mechanism allows traceroute to discover the path a packet takes by incrementing the starting TTL value and tracking the ICMP Time Exceeded responses from each hop.","['Kurose, J. F., & Ross, K.
