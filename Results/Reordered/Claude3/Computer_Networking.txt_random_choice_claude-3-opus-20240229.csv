c. Bluetooth
d. Zigbee
",,c,c,,"Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard commonly used for exchanging data over short distances between fixed and mobile devices. It operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM band and is designed for low power consumption, making it ideal for short-range communication between devices such as smartphones, wireless headphones, keyboards, and other peripherals.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth', 'https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/tech-overview/']",1,Computer_Networking,0.95,1,1.0

b. Z-Wave
c. Zigbee
d. NFC
",,d,d,,"NFC (Near Field Communication) is the wireless technology most commonly used for contactless payment systems. NFC operates at very short ranges (typically a few centimeters) and allows secure communication between a payment terminal and an NFC-enabled device like a smartphone or contactless credit card. This close proximity makes it well-suited for secure applications like payments. Bluetooth, Z-Wave, and Zigbee have longer ranges and are more often used for other applications like audio streaming, home automation, and low-power sensor networks respectively.","['https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-nfc-270730/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication']",1,Computer_Networking,0.95,1,1.0
