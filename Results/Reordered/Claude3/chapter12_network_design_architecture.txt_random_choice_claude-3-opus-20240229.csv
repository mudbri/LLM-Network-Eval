204,"The customer edge device is typically a router, that sits at a customer site on MPLS networks and connects to a provider edge router (PE router) to take communications from a customer site to a provider side.","a. FALSE
b. TRUE
",,b,b,,"The statement is true. In an MPLS network, the customer edge (CE) device, which is typically a router, is located at the customer's premises. The CE router connects to the provider edge (PE) router, which is the entry point into the service provider's MPLS network. The CE router is responsible for forwarding customer traffic to the PE router, which then uses MPLS labels to transport the traffic across the provider's network to the destination.","['MPLS Fundamentals by Luc De Ghein, Cisco Press', 'RFC 4364 - BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)', 'Cisco Documentation: MPLS VPN Technology Overview']",1,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,1,1.0

211,Your company plans to start using public cloud service and now you are considering different WAN options. Your main concern is security by keeping the data private while also providing good QoS services. Which of the following options are under consideration? (Choose two answers.),"a.

c. Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider
d. Using an Internet connection with VPN
",,"a,c","c,d",,"To maintain data privacy and provide good QoS when connecting to a public cloud service, the two best options are:c) Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider. This provides a dedicated, secure link without traversing the public Internet. d) Using an Internet connection with a VPN.
