b. Often deployed in data center networks to allow multiple tenants to share physical network infrastructure.
c. Separates the data and control plane.

e. Abstracts the details of the physical network.

c. Software-defined networking is a potential enabler for virtual networks, since separation of data and control planes makes it easier to manage a logical network topology.
