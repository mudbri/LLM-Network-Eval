46,What transport layer protocol does DNS normally use?,"a. UDP
b. ICMP
c. TCP
d. IP
",,a,a,,"DNS normally uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) as its transport layer protocol. UDP is a lightweight, connectionless protocol that allows for fast lookups without the overhead of establishing a connection, which is ideal for the typically small DNS queries and responses. DNS can use TCP for zone transfers between servers or for large responses exceeding the UDP size limit, but the vast majority of DNS traffic uses UDP.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross', 'RFC 1035 - Domain Names - Implementation and Specification, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035']",1,4_networking_serices,0.95,1,1.0

49,Which of the following are benefits of using Domain Name Resolution (DNS)? (Select all that apply.),"a. Small routing tables.
b. Allows administrative changes to happen seamlessly.
c. Easier for humans to remember website names.
d. Easy for the node to find the network ID.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"The main benefits of using DNS are that it allows administrative changes to happen seamlessly and makes it easier for humans to remember website names. With DNS, if a website's IP address changes, the change only needs to be updated in the DNS system rather than having every user update their records.
