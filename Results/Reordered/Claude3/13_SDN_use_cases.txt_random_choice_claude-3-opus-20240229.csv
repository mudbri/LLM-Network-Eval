95,What are some benefits to using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Host configuration is simpler, since all hosts are visible from a single large Ethernet topology.
b. Load balancing is easier on a layer-2 topology than on a layer 3 topology.
c. Forwarding on physical MAC addresses is simpler, since both the data center network topology and hosts' physical MAC addresses are hierarchical.
d. IP routing does not need to be reconfigured when physical or virtual machines move from one part of the network to another.
e. Scaling problems are simpler, since all hosts are configured on a single, flat topology.
",,"a,d","a,d",,"Using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center provides benefits in terms of simpler host configuration, since all hosts are visible from a single large Ethernet topology. It also eliminates the need to reconfigure IP routing when physical or virtual machines move within the network, as they retain the same IP address. The other options are not correct benefits - load balancing is not necessarily easier on layer-2, forwarding based on hierarchical MAC addresses is not a typical approach, and large flat layer-2 topologies can actually introduce scaling challenges compared to hierarchical layer-3 designs.","['https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-defined-networks/9781449360962/ch04.html', 'https://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2995719&seqNum=3']",1,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,1,1.0
96,"In PortLand, what are the reasons for assigning hosts pseudo-MAC addresses, as opposed to simply forwarding traffic on physical MAC addresses? Select all that apply.","a. Hosts in the data-center network topology are more vulnerable to attack if they expose their actual physical MAC addresses, rather than having a layer of indirection.
b. Forwarding loops are be more common in a flat layer-2 topology than they are in a topology with hierarchical pseudo MAC addresses.
c. In a flat layer-2 topology, switches cannot know on which port to forward traffic without maintaining switch tables for each MAC address, since MAC addresses are flat, not hierarchical.
d. Without pseudo-MAC addresses, switches would have to update forwarding state whenever hosts with a particular MAC address moved from one portion of the topology to another.
e. It is very difficult to load balance traffic using physical MAC addresses; pseudo MAC addresses make it possible to assign traffic to destination IP addresses.
",,"c,d","c,d",,"In a flat layer-2 topology using physical MAC addresses, switches would need to maintain large forwarding tables for each individual MAC address since MAC addresses are not hierarchical (c). This does not scale well in large networks. Additionally, if a host moves to a different part of the network, switches would need to update their forwarding state to reflect the new location of that MAC address (d). Using pseudo-MAC addresses allows the network to encode location information hierarchically into the MAC, enabling more efficient forwarding table lookups and reducing the need for updates when hosts move.","['https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/papers/portland08.pdf', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo_MAC_address']",1,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,1,1.0
97,What are the steps involved in the Proxy ARP process that PortLand's Fabric Manager runs?,"a. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns returns PMAC directly to the end host.
b. Host sends ARP query, fabric manager intercepts ARP query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to end host.
c. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to the host.
d. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch returns PMAC to end host.
e. Edge switch sends ARP query to fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch updates its local PMAC mapping table.
",,d,d,,"In the PortLand Proxy ARP process, when a host sends an ARP query, the edge switch intercepts the query and redirects it to the fabric manager. The fabric manager then consults its PMAC mapping table to find the corresponding PMAC for the requested IP address. It returns this PMAC to the edge switch, which in turn sends the PMAC back to the requesting host. This allows the host to communicate using the PMAC without needing to know the actual MAC addresses of other hosts.","['PortLand: A Scalable Fault-Tolerant Layer 2 Data Center Network Fabric, Mysore et al., 2009', 'https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/nsdi11/tech/full_papers/Yu.pdf']",1,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,1,1.0
98,"What are some of the disadvantages of today's interdomain routing protocol, BGP? Select all that apply.","a. ISPs can only influence the routing decisions of their immediate neighbor, not the entire end-to-end path.
b. ISPs cannot load-balance traffic across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix.
c. ISPs cannot express preference of one route over another, given multiple routes to a destination.
d. Routing and forwarding decisions are only based on IP prefix, not on a broader range of traffic flow attributes.
e. ISPs can only influence route selection through indirect mechanisms (e.g., prepending), rather than directly manipulating the forwarding table entries in switches.
",,"a,d,e","a,d,e",,"The disadvantages of BGP include: (a) ISPs can only influence routing decisions of immediate neighbors, not the entire end-to-end path, because BGP is a path-vector protocol where route advertisements only propagate to directly connected peers. (d) Routing and forwarding decisions in BGP are based solely on destination IP prefix, not considering other traffic flow attributes like source IP, port numbers, etc. (e) ISPs can only indirectly influence route selection in BGP through mechanisms like AS path prepending, rather than directly manipulating the forwarding tables. However, (b) is incorrect as BGP does allow load-balancing traffic across multiple equal-cost paths to the same destination.

103,What are some of the motivations for applying software defined networking in home networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Better performance, since control decisions can be made from a well-provisioned server, as opposed to an under-provisioned router.
b. More fine-grained control over the forwarding behavior of individual devices as conditions in the network change (e.g., a device uses too much bandwidth or data).
c. Ability to better user interfaces to control home network behavior, independent of the interfaces that ship with home router devices.
d. Ability to allow multiple service providers access to the home network infrastructure for different applications and services.
e. Outsourcing control and management of the home network to a third party.

104,"Suppose that an operator of a home network wants to write the following policy:
1. Block all traffic to Facebook from my child's computer.
2. Rate limit BitTorrent traffic from my child's computer if the VoIP client on my desktop is active.
Which of the following most closely approximates the policy?  Assume that ""facebook"" represents Facebook IP addresses, that ""bittorrent"" represents BitTorrent ports, and that ""limitifVOIP"" is a dynamic policy that checks a Resonance-like state machine to determine whether VOIP traffic has recently been observed.","a.

",,b,b,,The policy requires blocking Facebook traffic from the child's computer and rate limiting BitTorrent traffic from the child's computer if VoIP is active on the desktop. Option b correctly represents this using the '+' operator to combine the two policy components in parallel. The first component matches traffic from the child's IP to Facebook IPs and drops it. The second component matches traffic from the child's IP to BitTorrent ports and applies the dynamic limitIfVOIP policy. Options a and d incorrectly use the '>>' sequential composition operator which would apply the second policy only to traffic not matched by the first. Option c uses '+' for the primitive match and action statements which is not the correct syntax.,"['Resonance: Dynamic Access Control for Enterprise Networks. Nayak et al.
