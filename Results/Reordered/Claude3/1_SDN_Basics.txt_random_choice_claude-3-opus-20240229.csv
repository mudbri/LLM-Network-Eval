1,Which of the following are true about Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)? Select all that apply.,"a. The only sizes for an IP address allocation before CIDR were 8, 16, or 24 bits.
b. The prefix length for a CIDR prefix can be anywhere in the range from 0 to 32 bits.
c. CIDR slowed the rate of Internet routing table growth because prefixes no longer had to be allocated in fixed-size blocks.
d. In an Internet forwarding table with CIDR, there can only be one unique matching entry for any given IP address.
",,"b,c","b,c",,"CIDR allows for variable-length subnet masking, meaning the prefix length can be any value between 0 and 32 bits, not just 8, 16, or 24 bits as was the case before CIDR (eliminating option a). CIDR helped slow the growth of routing tables by allowing more granular allocation of IP address blocks based on actual need rather than fixed sizes (supporting option c). However, with CIDR, a given IP address can match multiple entries in the forwarding table, with the longest matching prefix being used (contradicting option d).","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross, Section 4.1.3', 'RFC 4632: Classless Inter-domain Routing (CIDR): The Internet Address Assignment and Aggregation Plan']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1,1.0
2,Which of the following are true about how DNS lookups work? Select all that apply.,"a. All DNS PTR records are maintained by a single organization in-addr.arpa.
b. A DNS A-record query for google.com will only return a single IP address at a time.
c. An MX-record query for a DNS lookup will return the IP address of the mail server for that domain.
d. If your local DNS resolver caches an NS record for google.com for multiple days, all clients who use that DNS resolver will continue using the same IP address to reach Google’s Web server until that NS record expires.
e. An NS-record query for a DNS lookup will return the name(s) of the authoritative name server(s) for that domain.
",,e,e,,"Only option e is correct about how DNS lookups work. An NS (Name Server) record query for a domain will return the name(s) of the authoritative name server(s) responsible for that domain. The other options are incorrect:a. PTR records are not all maintained by a single organization. They are managed by the owner of the IP address block.  b. An A record can return multiple IP addresses if multiple A records exist for a domain, enabling load balancing.c. An MX record returns the hostname of the mail server, not the IP address directly. An additional A record lookup is needed to resolve the IP.d. NS records point to the authoritative name servers. Clients do not use NS records directly to determine the IP address of the web server.","['DNS and BIND, 5th Edition by Cricket Liu, Paul Albitz', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1,1.0
3,Which of the following are true about traffic control with BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
b. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
c. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
d. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
",,"c,d","a,d",,"A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control outbound traffic from their AS to a destination. By artificially increasing the length of the AS path, the route appears less preferred to other ASes, thus reducing outbound traffic on that path.

It allows a higher preference to be set for certain routes, causing outbound traffic to favor those paths.","[""Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross, Section 4.3 on 'The Internet Protocol (IP): Forwarding and Addressing in the Internet'"", 'BGP Traffic Engineering Techniques, Cisco, https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/iproute_bgp/configuration/xe-3s/irg-xe-3s-book/irg-bgp-traffic.html']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1,0.0
4,Which of the following are true about layering? Select all that apply.,"a. The transport layer uses port numbers.
b. The destination address in the link layer header is always the address of the next layer-3 node along an end-to-end IP path.
c. The network layer guarantees reliable, in-order delivery of packets.
d. The network layer has only a single protocol in widespread use today, representing what we call the “narrow waist”.
",,"a,d","a,d",,"The transport layer uses port numbers to multiplex and demultiplex data streams to the correct application. The network layer has a narrow waist with IP being the single dominant protocol in widespread use today.

5,Which of the following are not true about packet switching? Select all that apply.,"a. A user of a packet switched network might occasionally get a “busy signal” if there are too many users on the network.
b. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will always experience predictable latency.
c. Once a connection is established between two endpoints in a packet switched network, the end-to-end route cannot change, or the connection must be re-established.
d. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will never be dropped by intermediate nodes along the path.
",,"a,b,c,d","b,c,d",,"In a packet-switched network: a) Users do not get busy signals as there are no dedicated circuits. Packets are queued if the network is congested. b) Latency is not predictable as it depends on network conditions, queuing, and routing, which can vary. c) The route between endpoints can change on a per-packet basis without disrupting the connection. d) Packets can be dropped by intermediate nodes due to congestion, errors, or other network issues.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1,0.5
6,Which of the following are true about content distribution networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Content distribution networks can reduce transit expenses for a content provider by enabling much of the provider’s content to be served from a nearby network, sometimes even from a cache that is within the client’s own network.
b. Real-time content such as video streams cannot be distributed from a content distribution network.
c. Content distribution networks can improve the performance that a client sees by reducing the network latency between the client and the content that it is downloading.
d. Content distribution networks typically redirect Web clients to a nearby Web cache by rewriting the IP address of packets sent from the client to the IP address of the nearby Web cache.

7,Which of the following are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control? Select all that apply.,"a. Disabling RTS/CTS necessarily lowers the effective throughput of the wireless network, since more collisions will occur at the receiver without RTS/CTS enabled.
b. Using RTS/CTS (“request to send”, “clear to send”) control reduces the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network.
c. A wireless sender can avoid causing a collision at the receiver by performing a “carrier sense” to determine whether any other sender wants to transmit at the time that it wishes to send a packet.
d. Only wireless networks can have collisions at the receiver; such collisions are not possible on wired Ethernet networks.
",,b,"b,c",,"Using RTS/CTS reduces the overall throughput because of the additional overhead, but it helps avoid collisions especially for larger frames (choice b). A sender can perform carrier sensing to check if the medium is idle before transmitting to avoid collisions (choice c). Disabling RTS/CTS doesn't necessarily lower throughput as it depends on factors like frame size and number of stations (choice a is incorrect). Collisions can occur on wired Ethernet too when multiple stations transmit simultaneously (choice d is incorrect).","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross, Section 6.3.2', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11_RTS/CTS']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,1,0.5
8,Which of the following are true about video streaming? Select all that apply.,"a. Since UDP provides no reliable delivery guarantees, a video streaming application that uses UDP as its transport cannot recover from any packet loss in the video stream.
b. Using TCP for video streaming could result in larger delays between transmission and playout than streaming the same video with UDP.
c. A larger playout buffer at the client allows the client more time to recover from lost packets.
d. Using UDP to stream a video instead of TCP is appropriate if the client is more concerned about low delay and interactivity than it does about receiving a high-quality stream.
",,"b,c,d","b,c,d",,"Using TCP for video streaming could result in larger delays compared to UDP due to TCP's retransmission of lost packets and congestion control mechanisms (b). A larger playout buffer gives the client more time to request and receive retransmissions of lost packets before the video needs to be played out (c). UDP is preferable to TCP for video streaming when low latency and interactivity are prioritized over perfect video quality, since UDP has no retransmissions or congestion control that would increase delay (d). However, choice (a) is incorrect because video streaming applications using UDP can implement their own mechanisms above UDP to recover from packet loss, such as error correction or selective retransmission.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross, Section 7.3', 'High Performance Browser Networking by Ilya Grigorik, Chapter 10: Primer on Video Streaming']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1,1.0
9,Which of the following are true about TCP? Select all that apply.,"a. A TCP sender controls its sending rate by adjusting the number of unacknowledged packets that can be sent over the network at any time.
b. TCP’s congestion avoidance algorithm causes the sender to reduce its sending rate by a factor of two when it sees a packet loss.
c. A TCP sender and receiver use a “three-way handshake” both to set up and to terminate the TCP connection.
d. TCP guarantees that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted.
",,"a,b,d","a,d",,"TCP senders control their sending rate by adjusting the congestion window size, which limits the number of unacknowledged packets that can be in flight at any time (a). TCP also provides reliable, in-order delivery of byte streams to the receiver, ensuring the receiver sees the same data in the same order that the sender transmitted (d). While TCP does reduce its sending rate when it detects congestion, it does not always reduce it by a factor of two (b is incorrect). The three-way handshake is used to establish a TCP connection, but terminating a connection uses a different exchange involving FIN packets (c is incorrect).","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross, Section 3.5', 'TCP congestion control: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control', 'TCP connection establishment and termination: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Connection_establishment']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1,0.5
10,Which of the following are true about denial of service attacks (and defenses)? Select all that apply.,"a. In a “SYN Flood” attack, each TCP SYN packet that a victim receives causes it to set up TCP connection state.
b. A “DNS Reflection” attack requires the attacking client to “spoof” the source IP address of the packet containing the DNS request.
c. If every network on the Internet performed stateless ingress filtering to defend against source IP spoofing, the DNS reflection attack would not work.
d. If every network on the Internet performed stateless egress filtering to defend against source IP address spoofing, the DNS reflection attack could not be carried out.
",,"a,b,d","a,b,d",,"A SYN flood attack exploits the TCP handshake process by sending many SYN packets to a victim, causing it to allocate resources for half-open connections that are never completed, potentially exhausting the victim's resources. A DNS reflection attack involves an attacker sending DNS queries with a spoofed source IP of the victim to many DNS servers, causing them to flood the victim with DNS responses. Stateless ingress filtering checks if the source IP of incoming packets belongs to the expected network, but wouldn't prevent the spoofed DNS queries from reaching open DNS resolvers. However, if every network implemented egress filtering to prevent spoofed source IPs from leaving their network, attackers couldn't send DNS queries with the victim's IP, rendering this attack ineffective.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Reflected_attack', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingress_filtering', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egress_filtering']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1,1.0
