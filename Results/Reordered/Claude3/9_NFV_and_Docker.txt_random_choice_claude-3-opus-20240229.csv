72,"In NFV, which of the following is the function of steering?","a. Finding the best location to place a single network function in an enterprise or wide area network.
b. Installing custom packet processing code on servers in the network.
c. Installing flow table entries in switches to forward traffic through network functions or middleboxes that are installed in the network
d. Installing custom packet processing code on switches in the network.
e. Placing middleboxes at places throughout the network to minimize network load.
",,c,c,,"In Network Function Virtualization (NFV), steering refers to the process of directing network traffic through a sequence of network functions or middleboxes. This is typically achieved by installing appropriate flow table entries in the switches of the network. These flow table entries define rules that match on certain packet header fields and specify the actions to take, such as forwarding the packet to a specific network function. By chaining multiple network functions together using steering, complex network services can be realized.","['ETSI GS NFV 002 V1.2.1 (2014-12): Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV); Architectural Framework', 'Herrera, J.

74,What are some advantages of Docker containers over virtual machines? Select all that apply.,"a. Containers provide better isolation than virtual machines.
b. Performance in containers may be better since they invoke OS system calls directly, rather than through an emulated machine.
c. Containers can be connected to build a virtual network, whereas virtual machines cannot.
d. Containers require less storage and memory per-instance, and require less time to instantiate than virtual machines.
e. Containers provide more flexibility in the choice of operating system.
",,"b,d","b,d",,"Containers typically provide better performance than virtual machines since they invoke OS system calls directly rather than through an emulated machine (b). Containers also generally require less storage, memory, and startup time compared to virtual machines since they share the host OS kernel and libraries (d). However, virtual machines provide stronger isolation than containers (a). Both containers and VMs can be networked (c). VMs provide more flexibility in OS choice since containers share the host OS kernel (e).","['https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/', 'https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/containers-vs-vms', 'https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/containers-vs-virtual-machines/']",1,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.95,1,1.0
75,Which of the following commands is used to instantiate a new Docker container by invoking a command in that container?,"a. docker commit
b. docker attach
c. docker pull
d. docker stop
e. docker run
",,e,e,,"The 'docker run' command is used to create and start a new Docker container from an image. It allows you to specify the image to use and the command to run inside the container when it starts. The other options are used for different purposes: 'docker commit' creates a new image from a container's changes, 'docker attach' attaches to a running container, 'docker pull' downloads an image from a registry, and 'docker stop' stops a running container.","['https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/', 'https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/commit/', 'https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/attach/', 'https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/', 'https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stop/']",1,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.95,1,1.0
76,Which of the following is true about networking Docker containers? Select all that apply.,"a. Connecting Docker containers requires setting up GRE tunnels between the containers.
b. Docker containers are not reachable from the external Internet by default.
c. Docker containers running in different virtual machines cannot be networked together.
d. A Docker container can never expose a low port (e.g., port 80) to the external Internet; Internet hosts must always reach a Docker service by a high port (e.g., 8080).
e. Docker containers can be networked to each other via the native Docker bridge or Open vSwitch.
",,"b,e","b,e",,"Docker containers are not reachable from the external Internet by default for security reasons. They run in an isolated network environment. However, Docker containers can be networked to each other using the native Docker bridge or Open vSwitch, which allows containers to communicate. The other options are incorrect: GRE tunnels are not required, containers across VMs can be networked, and containers can expose low ports to the Internet if explicitly configured to do so.","['https://docs.docker.com/network/', 'https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/']",1,9_NFV_and_Docker,0.95,1,1.0
