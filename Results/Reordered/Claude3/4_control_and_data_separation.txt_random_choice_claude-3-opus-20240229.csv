25,What could be the operational steps behind the AT&T's IRSCP (a commercial version of the Routing Control Platform) for detecting malicious traffic? Select all that apply.,"a. The controller sees all traffic passing through the network, detects an attack, and installs a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where the attack traffic is originating.
b. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to install a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where attack traffic is originating.
c. A victim end host sends an alert to an on-path firewall about the source and nature of an attack, at which point the firewall installs a null route to drop the traffic at the entry point where the attack is originating.
d. The end host changes its IP address so that it is no longer the target of the attack traffic.
e. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to re-route traffic through a deep-packet inspection device.
",,"b,e","b,e",,"The correct steps for AT&T's IRSCP in detecting and mitigating malicious traffic are:b) A measurement system detects the attack, identifies the entry point, and instructs the controller to install a null route at that entry point to drop the attack traffic. This allows the attack to be stopped at the source.  e) Alternatively, the measurement system can instruct the controller to re-route the traffic through a deep packet inspection device for further analysis and filtering of malicious packets. This allows more granular control than a blanket null route.The other options are incorrect because:a) The controller does not see all traffic and detect attacks itself. It relies on the measurement system. c) The end host/victim does not send alerts to an on-path firewall. The detection is done by a separate measurement system.d) Changing the end host IP does not stop the attack traffic from entering and traversing the network.","['https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos597E/papers/sdnhistory.pdf', 'https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi17/nsdi17-kang.pdf']",1,4_control_and_data_separation,0.9,1,1.0

",,a,"a,e",,"Layer-2 forwarding in a data center is motivated by easier configuration and administration, as well as better scaling properties. With Layer-2 forwarding, there is no need to assign IP addresses to hosts or configure subnets, simplifying network setup and management (a). Layer-2 forwarding also allows the network to scale better, as the number of forwarding table entries is limited by the number of MAC addresses rather than IP addresses (e).

b. Virtual machines can be migrated within the network without renumbering entire portions of the network or re-assigning network services to different IP addresses.
c. All routes can be controlled and monitored from a central point of control.
d. The control plane allows traffic to be forwarded using Layer 2 addresses, thus allowing automatic load balance across the topology.
e. The separation allows fewer switches to be used in the data center topology, thus lowering costs.

Eliminating redundant data structures helps optimize the control plane by reducing unnecessary overhead.e.

32,"Which property guarantees that each RCP replica continues to install correct forwarding state in the network data plane, even in the case of a partition in the data plane?","a. The controller cannot see many of the routers in the network anyway, so there is no way for it to install incorrect routing state in the routers that it is not connected to.
b. Running the network from a single high-level control plane guarantees that network partitions and loops never occur in the first place.
c. Each controller has a complete view of the portion of the network that it is controlling, and therefore can guarantee consistent routing within that partition.
d. The controllers are partitioned from the network routers, and the routers will fall back to running a distributed routing protocol.
