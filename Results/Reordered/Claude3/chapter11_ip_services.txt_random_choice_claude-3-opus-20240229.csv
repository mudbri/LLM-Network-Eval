You are responsible to find out why users are not being able to reach the Internet.","a. Dynamic NAT can't use Standard ACLs
b. The NAT pool does not have enough entries to fulfill the user's requests
c. The cause is not related to dynamic NAT
d. The command output does not provide any clue to identify the problem
",,b,b,,"The output shows that the NAT pool 'examsdigest' has a total of 10 addresses, all of which have been allocated. The 'misses' counter indicates there have been 595 requests that could not be fulfilled due to lack of available addresses in the pool. This suggests the NAT pool is undersized and does not have enough entries to handle the number of users trying to access the Internet.","['Cisco CCNA Official Cert Guide, Chapter 10: Network Address Translation', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/network-address-translation-nat/13772-12.html']",1,chapter11_ip_services,0.9,1,1.0

Host A and host B attach to the same LAN and have correct default router settings per the FHRP configuration. Which of the following statements is true for this LAN?","a. If one router fails, both hosts will use the one remaining router as a default router
b. If one router fails, hosts can't send packets off-subnet
c. You can't connect two routers to the same LAN subnet.
d. if one router fails, only one of the two hosts will still be able to send packets off-subnet
