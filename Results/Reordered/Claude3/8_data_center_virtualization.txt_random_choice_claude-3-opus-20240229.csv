62,Which of the following are true of “network slicing”? Select all that apply.,"a. A controller can prevent one network slice from interfering with the resources of another.
b. Network operators can use slicing to test configurations on “shadow” networks that mirror a production network topology.
c. Conventional (i.e., non-SDN) networks have no concept of network virtualization or slicing.
d. One way to slice networks is according to “flow space”, whereby different controllers might control distinct and non-overlapping traffic flows.
e. Multi-tenant datacenters are one use case for network slicing.
",,"b,d,e","a,b,d,e",,"Network slicing allows partitioning a physical network into multiple isolated virtual networks. A controller can enforce resource isolation between slices (a). Slicing enables testing configurations on shadow networks mirroring production (b). Slicing can be done based on non-overlapping flow spaces controlled by different controllers (d). Multi-tenant datacenters are a key use case to provide isolated virtual networks to tenants (e). However, (c) is incorrect as conventional networks do have concepts of virtualization and slicing, such as VLANs and VPNs, though SDN enables more flexible and dynamic slicing.","['https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/nfv/definitions/what-is-network-slicing/', 'https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-definition/', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/network-slicing.html']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.95,1,0.6000000000000001
63,Which of the following are true about flow spaces? Select all that apply.,"a. Flow spaces can only be defined according to combinations of packet header fields.
b. Two controllers that write data-plane rules for non-overlapping parts of flowspace can never cause traffic from one “slice” to enter the other slice.
c. Two flow spaces cannot overlap.
d. Flowspace isolation separates individual virtual networks from one another but incurs some performance penalty for doing so.
e. One host could send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces.
",,e,"b,d,e",,"Flow spaces can be defined based on various criteria beyond just packet header fields (a is incorrect). Two non-overlapping flow spaces are isolated from each other, preventing traffic crossing between them (b is correct). Flow spaces can overlap (c is incorrect). Flowspace isolation does provide separation between virtual networks but comes with some performance overhead (d is correct). A host's traffic could potentially match multiple flow spaces if they are defined in an overlapping manner (e is correct).","['Flowspace Virtualization - https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sb-flowspace-virtualization.pdf', 'Flowspace Firewall - https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi14/technical-sessions/presentation/kang', 'OpenFlow Switch Specification v1.5.1 - https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/openflow-switch-v1.5.1.pdf']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,1,0.1999999999999999
64,Which of the following describe the control-plane checks that FlowVisor implements? Select all that apply.,"a. When a packet must be forwarded to a controller, Flowvisor forwards traffic to the correct controller based on which controller “owns” the flowspace corresponding to that packet.
b. Flowvisor can only instantiate network slices based on the network topology, not based on other properties, such as application traffic.
c. Flowvisor prevents a controller from writing data-plane rules to a part of flowspace that it does not own.
d. Flowvisor installs traffic shaping and quality of service rules to ensure that each network slice has guaranteed resources.
e. Flowvisor prevents each slice's controller from being the target of a denial of service attack from other slices.
",,"a,c","a,c",,"FlowVisor performs control-plane checks to ensure each controller only operates within its assigned flowspace. This includes forwarding packets to the correct controller based on flowspace ownership (a) and preventing a controller from writing data-plane rules to flowspace it doesn't own (c).

65,Which of the following are applications in a home network that network slicing could enable? Select all that apply.,"a. Smart grid applications
b. Guest WiFi access
c. Load balance of inbound traffic
d. Traceback of attack traffic to its source
e. Quality of service for certain applications (e.g., video streaming)
",,"a,b,e","b,e",,"Network slicing could enable guest WiFi access (b) by creating a separate slice for guest devices, isolating them from the main home network for security. It could also enable quality of service for certain applications like video streaming (e) by dedicating network resources to a slice optimized for that traffic type.

69,What are examples of multi-tenant datacenter applications? Select all that apply.,"a. A retailer running a large, multi-site enterprise network across its global network of sites
b. Google running Gmail and search from a common facility
c. Two enterprises hosting data in a shared facility.
d. A home network owner running a private and public WiFi network
e. Amazon hosting EC2 instances for customers
",,"b,c,e","b,c,e",,"Multi-tenant datacenter applications are those where multiple customers or tenants share the same physical infrastructure and resources in a datacenter facility. Google running Gmail and search from a common facility (b) is an example, as Google hosts these services for many users from shared infrastructure. Two enterprises hosting data in a shared facility (c) also represents multi-tenancy, as the enterprises are sharing the datacenter resources.

70,What best describes the relationship between network virtualization and SDN? Select all that apply.,"a. Network virtualization requires SDN
b. Network virtualization enables SDN
c. SDN makes some aspects of network virtualization easier to manage
d. SDN predates network virtualization
e. SDN controllers can help manage storage and data facilities, in addition to network configuration
",,"c,e","b,c",,"Network virtualization and SDN are complementary but distinct concepts. Network virtualization does not require SDN, but it enables SDN by abstracting the physical network into a logical overlay that can be programmatically controlled. SDN, in turn, makes some aspects of network virtualization easier to manage by providing a centralized control plane to configure and orchestrate the virtual network overlay. While SDN controllers can help manage network configuration, they typically do not directly manage storage and data facilities. Also, network virtualization predates the emergence of SDN.","['Software Defined Networks: A Comprehensive Approach by Paul Goransson and Chuck Black', 'Network Virtualization by Victor Moreno and Kumar Reddy', 'Software Defined Networking (SDN): Anatomy of OpenFlow by Doug Marschke et al.']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,1,0.1999999999999999

e. NVP allows tenants to configure switches in the middle of the network for portions of flowspace that they own.
