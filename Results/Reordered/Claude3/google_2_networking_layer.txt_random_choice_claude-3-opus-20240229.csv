",,d,d,,"CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing. It is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing Internet Protocol packets. CIDR was introduced in 1993 to replace the previous classful network addressing architecture. It allows for more flexible allocation of IP addresses compared to the rigid class-based system. CIDR notation is used to specify an IP address along with its network prefix, which determines the network and host portions of the address.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html']",1,2_networking_layer,0.98,1,1.0
