1,Which of the following terms describe Ethernet addresses that can send one frame and is delivered to multiple devices on the LAN? (Choose two answers.),"a. Multicast address
b. Broadcast address
c. Unicast address
d. IP address
e. MAC address
",,"a,b","a,b",,"Multicast and broadcast addresses are the two types of Ethernet addresses that can send a single frame to be delivered to multiple devices on a LAN. A multicast address allows a frame to be sent to a specific group of devices, while a broadcast address sends the frame to all devices on the LAN. Unicast addresses are used for sending a frame to a single specific device. IP address refers to the network layer addressing, not the Ethernet (data link layer) addressing. MAC address is a general term for the Ethernet address, which includes unicast, multicast, and broadcast addresses.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Wendell Odom, Cisco Press', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html', 'https://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2832407&seqNum=6']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,0.95,1,1.0
