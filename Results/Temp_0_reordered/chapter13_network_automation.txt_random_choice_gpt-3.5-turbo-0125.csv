b. Network time travel
c. Encrypted traffic analysis
d. Path trace
",,a,a,,"The feature of Cisco DNA Center that provides a comprehensive view of the health of the device is Device 360. It offers detailed insights into the device's health status, configuration, performance, and more. Client 360, on the other hand, focuses on client devices, not the health of the network devices themselves. Network time travel is a feature that allows you to view network events historically. Encrypted traffic analysis deals with analyzing encrypted traffic for security purposes. Path trace is used to trace the path of a packet through the network.",['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/cloud-systems-management/dna-center/index.html'],1,chapter13_network_automation,0.9,0.9999903893441826,1.0
