91,You have noticed that a server with IP 145.45.3.2 doesn’t respond to requests. What command will you type first in order to test connectivity between your device and the server?,"a. ping 145.45.3.2

d. check 145.45.3.2
",,a,a,,"The correct command to test connectivity between your device and the server with IP 145.45.3.2 is to use the 'ping' command followed by the IP address of the server. The 'ping' command sends ICMP echo request packets to the specified IP address and waits for ICMP echo replies, which helps in determining if the server is reachable and responsive.",['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)'],1,chapter5_ipv4_routing,1.0,0.9992272398330472,1.0
92,"A LAN design uses a Layer 3 EtherChannel between two switches SW1 and SW2, with port-channel interface 1 used on both switches. SW1 uses ports G0/1 and G0/2 in the channel. However, only interface G0/1 is bundled into the channel and working. Think about the configuration settings on port G0/2 that could have existed before adding G0/2 to the EtherChannel. Which answers identify a setting that could prevent IOS from adding G0/2 to the Layer 3 EtherChannel? (Choose two answers.)","a. A different STP cost (spanning-tree cost value)
b. A default setting for switchport (switchport)
c. A different speed (speed value)
d. A different access VLAN (switchport access vlan vlanid)
",,"b,c","a,c",,"A and C are the correct answers. When configuring an EtherChannel, the interfaces must have compatible settings to be bundled together. If there is a difference in STP cost (spanning-tree cost value) between the interfaces, it can prevent them from forming an EtherChannel. Similarly, if the speed settings (speed value) on the interfaces are different, it can also prevent them from being bundled into the EtherChannel.",['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750x_3560x/software/release/12-2_55_se/configuration/guide/3750xscg/swethchl.html'],0,chapter5_ipv4_routing,0.9,0.7187866211523908,0.0
93,"A network engineer has configured a Layer 3 switch with SVIs for VLANs 4 and 5. Hosts in the subnets using VLANs 4 and 5 can ping each other with the Layer 3 switch routing the packets. The next week, the network engineer receives a call that those same users can no longer ping each other. If the problem is with the Layer 3 switching function, which of the following could have caused the problem? (Choose two answers.)","a. VTP on the switch removing VLAN 5 from the switch’s VLAN list
b. 1 out of 10 working VLAN 4 access ports failing due to physical problems
c. A shutdown command issued from VLAN 4 configuration mode
d. A shutdown command issued from VLAN 6 configuration mode
",,"a,c","a,c",,"The correct answers are A and C. If VTP removes VLAN 5 from the switch's VLAN list, the SVI for VLAN 5 will go down, causing the Layer 3 routing for VLAN 5 to stop. Similarly, issuing a shutdown command from VLAN 4 configuration mode will bring down the SVI for VLAN 4, halting the routing for VLAN 4. Physical problems with access ports in VLAN 4 would not affect the SVI as long as there are other working ports. Shutdown of VLAN 6 does not directly impact VLANs 4 and 5.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_virtual_interface', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/aci/apic/sw/4-x/L3-configuration/Cisco-APIC-Layer-3-Networking-Configuration-Guide-42x/Cisco-APIC-Layer-3-Networking-Configuration-Guide-42x_chapter_01101.pdf']",1,chapter5_ipv4_routing,0.9,0.9864799416199792,1.0
