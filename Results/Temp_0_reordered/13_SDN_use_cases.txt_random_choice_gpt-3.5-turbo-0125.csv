95,What are some benefits to using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Host configuration is simpler, since all hosts are visible from a single large Ethernet topology.
b. Load balancing is easier on a layer-2 topology than on a layer 3 topology.
c. Forwarding on physical MAC addresses is simpler, since both the data center network topology and hosts' physical MAC addresses are hierarchical.
d. IP routing does not need to be reconfigured when physical or virtual machines move from one part of the network to another.
e. Scaling problems are simpler, since all hosts are configured on a single, flat topology.
",,"a,d","a,c",,"a. Using a layer-2 MAC topology makes host configuration simpler as all hosts are visible from a single large Ethernet topology, reducing complexity and management overhead. c. Forwarding on physical MAC addresses is simpler in a layer-2 topology due to the hierarchical structure of both the network topology and hosts' physical MAC addresses. This simplifies forwarding decisions and reduces lookup complexity.",['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/data-center-virtualization/application-centric-infrastructure/white-paper-c11-731302.html'],0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,0.9465724942672084,0.1999999999999999
96,"In PortLand, what are the reasons for assigning hosts pseudo-MAC addresses, as opposed to simply forwarding traffic on physical MAC addresses? Select all that apply.","a. Hosts in the data-center network topology are more vulnerable to attack if they expose their actual physical MAC addresses, rather than having a layer of indirection.
b. Forwarding loops are be more common in a flat layer-2 topology than they are in a topology with hierarchical pseudo MAC addresses.
c. In a flat layer-2 topology, switches cannot know on which port to forward traffic without maintaining switch tables for each MAC address, since MAC addresses are flat, not hierarchical.
d. Without pseudo-MAC addresses, switches would have to update forwarding state whenever hosts with a particular MAC address moved from one portion of the topology to another.
e. It is very difficult to load balance traffic using physical MAC addresses; pseudo MAC addresses make it possible to assign traffic to destination IP addresses.
",,"c,d","a,c,d",,"a. Hosts in the data-center network are more secure when using pseudo-MAC addresses as they add a layer of indirection, making it harder for attackers to target specific hosts directly. This is a security measure to protect the hosts' actual MAC addresses. c. In a flat layer-2 topology, switches need to maintain switch tables for each MAC address to know where to forward traffic. With hierarchical pseudo MAC addresses, switches can forward traffic based on a higher-level abstraction, reducing the need for extensive MAC address tables. d. Using pseudo-MAC addresses helps in avoiding frequent updates to the forwarding state in switches when hosts move within the network, as the pseudo addresses remain constant even if the physical hosts change locations.",['https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/PortLand-SIGCOMM10.pdf'],0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,0.6014140488185988,0.6000000000000001
97,What are the steps involved in the Proxy ARP process that PortLand's Fabric Manager runs?,"a. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns returns PMAC directly to the end host.
b. Host sends ARP query, fabric manager intercepts ARP query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to end host.
c. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to the host.
d. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch returns PMAC to end host.
e. Edge switch sends ARP query to fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch updates its local PMAC mapping table.
",,d,a,,"In the Proxy ARP process that PortLand's Fabric Manager runs, the correct sequence of steps involves the host sending an ARP query, the edge switch intercepting the query and redirecting it to the fabric manager, and then the fabric manager consulting the PMAC mapping table and returning the PMAC directly to the end host. This process ensures that the fabric manager is involved in handling ARP queries and providing the necessary information to the end host.",['https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/portland-nsdi.pdf'],0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,0.640383687849027,0.1999999999999999
98,"What are some of the disadvantages of today's interdomain routing protocol, BGP? Select all that apply.","a. ISPs can only influence the routing decisions of their immediate neighbor, not the entire end-to-end path.
b. ISPs cannot load-balance traffic across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix.
c. ISPs cannot express preference of one route over another, given multiple routes to a destination.
d. Routing and forwarding decisions are only based on IP prefix, not on a broader range of traffic flow attributes.
e. ISPs can only influence route selection through indirect mechanisms (e.g., prepending), rather than directly manipulating the forwarding table entries in switches.
",,"a,d,e","a,b,c,d,e",,"a. BGP operates on a hop-by-hop basis, allowing ISPs to influence routing decisions only to their immediate neighbors, not the entire path end-to-end. This limitation can lead to suboptimal routing decisions. b. BGP lacks the ability to perform traffic load balancing across multiple paths to the same destination IP prefix, which can result in unevenly distributed traffic. c. BGP does not provide a mechanism for expressing a preference for one route over another when multiple routes to a destination exist, potentially leading to inefficient routing. d. BGP makes routing decisions solely based on IP prefixes and does not consider a broader range of traffic flow attributes, which can limit the ability to optimize routing based on various factors. e. ISPs can influence route selection in BGP through indirect mechanisms like AS path prepending rather than directly manipulating forwarding table entries in switches, which can be less efficient and flexible.

103,What are some of the motivations for applying software defined networking in home networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Better performance, since control decisions can be made from a well-provisioned server, as opposed to an under-provisioned router.
b. More fine-grained control over the forwarding behavior of individual devices as conditions in the network change (e.g., a device uses too much bandwidth or data).

104,"Suppose that an operator of a home network wants to write the following policy:
