1,Which of the following are true about Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)? Select all that apply.,"a. The only sizes for an IP address allocation before CIDR were 8, 16, or 24 bits.
b. The prefix length for a CIDR prefix can be anywhere in the range from 0 to 32 bits.
c. CIDR slowed the rate of Internet routing table growth because prefixes no longer had to be allocated in fixed-size blocks.
d. In an Internet forwarding table with CIDR, there can only be one unique matching entry for any given IP address.
",,"b,c","b,c,d",,"a. This statement is incorrect as IP address allocations were not limited to 8, 16, or 24 bits before CIDR; CIDR introduced variable-length subnet masks (VLSM) allowing for more flexible address allocations. b. The prefix length in CIDR can indeed vary from 0 to 32 bits, enabling more granular address assignments. c. CIDR did help slow down the growth of Internet routing tables by allowing for more efficient allocation of address space. d. In CIDR, the forwarding table can have multiple entries for different prefixes, but the longest prefix match rule ensures only the most specific entry is used for forwarding.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-cidr/', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/13753-25.html']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.9987166508193908,0.5
2,Which of the following are true about how DNS lookups work? Select all that apply.,"a. All DNS PTR records are maintained by a single organization in-addr.arpa.
b. A DNS A-record query for google.com will only return a single IP address at a time.
c. An MX-record query for a DNS lookup will return the IP address of the mail server for that domain.

5,Which of the following are not true about packet switching? Select all that apply.,"a. A user of a packet switched network might occasionally get a “busy signal” if there are too many users on the network.
b. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will always experience predictable latency.
c. Once a connection is established between two endpoints in a packet switched network, the end-to-end route cannot change, or the connection must be re-established.
d. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will never be dropped by intermediate nodes along the path.
",,"a,b,c,d","a,b,c",,"a. In packet switching, there are no 'busy signals' as in circuit switching; packets may experience delays but not busy signals due to network congestion. Therefore, this statement is not true about packet switching. 
b. Packet-switched networks do not guarantee predictable latency as the path taken by packets can vary based on network conditions, leading to variable latency. Hence, this statement is not true. 
c. In packet switching, the end-to-end route can change dynamically based on network conditions or routing decisions without the need to re-establish connections.

6,Which of the following are true about content distribution networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Content distribution networks can reduce transit expenses for a content provider by enabling much of the provider’s content to be served from a nearby network, sometimes even from a cache that is within the client’s own network.
b. Real-time content such as video streams cannot be distributed from a content distribution network.
c. Content distribution networks can improve the performance that a client sees by reducing the network latency between the client and the content that it is downloading.
d. Content distribution networks typically redirect Web clients to a nearby Web cache by rewriting the IP address of packets sent from the client to the IP address of the nearby Web cache.
",,"a,c","a,c",,"a. Content distribution networks help reduce transit expenses by caching content closer to end-users, reducing the need for long-distance data transfers. This can lead to cost savings for content providers. c.

7,Which of the following are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control? Select all that apply.,"a. Disabling RTS/CTS necessarily lowers the effective throughput of the wireless network, since more collisions will occur at the receiver without RTS/CTS enabled.
b. Using RTS/CTS (“request to send”, “clear to send”) control reduces the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network.
c. A wireless sender can avoid causing a collision at the receiver by performing a “carrier sense” to determine whether any other sender wants to transmit at the time that it wishes to send a packet.
d. Only wireless networks can have collisions at the receiver; such collisions are not possible on wired Ethernet networks.
",,b,c,,"Option c is correct. A wireless sender can indeed perform a 'carrier sense' to check if the medium is busy before sending a packet, helping to avoid collisions.

8,Which of the following are true about video streaming? Select all that apply.,"a. Since UDP provides no reliable delivery guarantees, a video streaming application that uses UDP as its transport cannot recover from any packet loss in the video stream.
b. Using TCP for video streaming could result in larger delays between transmission and playout than streaming the same video with UDP.
c. A larger playout buffer at the client allows the client more time to recover from lost packets.
d. Using UDP to stream a video instead of TCP is appropriate if the client is more concerned about low delay and interactivity than it does about receiving a high-quality stream.
",,"b,c,d","c,d",,"c. A larger playout buffer at the client helps in recovering from lost packets by providing more time to retransmit or conceal the lost data, improving the quality of the stream. This statement is true about video streaming. d. UDP is suitable for applications where low delay and interactivity are crucial, making it appropriate for video streaming scenarios where real-time delivery is more important than ensuring every packet is received, as in live streaming or video conferencing.

9,Which of the following are true about TCP? Select all that apply.,"a. A TCP sender controls its sending rate by adjusting the number of unacknowledged packets that can be sent over the network at any time.
b. TCP’s congestion avoidance algorithm causes the sender to reduce its sending rate by a factor of two when it sees a packet loss.
c. A TCP sender and receiver use a “three-way handshake” both to set up and to terminate the TCP connection.
d. TCP guarantees that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted.
",,"a,b,d","a,c,d",,"a. A TCP sender controls its sending rate by adjusting the number of unacknowledged packets that can be sent over the network at any time. This is achieved through TCP's congestion control mechanisms like TCP congestion window and slow start algorithm. 
c. A TCP sender and receiver use a 'three-way handshake' both to set up and to terminate the TCP connection. The three-way handshake involves SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK segments to establish and terminate connections. 
d. TCP guarantees that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted. TCP ensures reliable data delivery by providing sequencing and acknowledgment mechanisms.","['https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/tcp-congestion-control/']",0,1_SDN_Basics,1.0,0.9760129185241164,0.0
10,Which of the following are true about denial of service attacks (and defenses)? Select all that apply.,"a. In a “SYN Flood” attack, each TCP SYN packet that a victim receives causes it to set up TCP connection state.
b. A “DNS Reflection” attack requires the attacking client to “spoof” the source IP address of the packet containing the DNS request.
c. If every network on the Internet performed stateless ingress filtering to defend against source IP spoofing, the DNS reflection attack would not work.
d. If every network on the Internet performed stateless egress filtering to defend against source IP address spoofing, the DNS reflection attack could not be carried out.
",,"a,b,d","b,c",,"b. In a 'DNS Reflection' attack, the attacking client spoofs the source IP address of the packet containing the DNS request to make it appear as if the request is coming from the victim's IP address. This is a characteristic of DNS reflection attacks. c. Performing stateless ingress filtering on every network to defend against source IP spoofing would prevent the DNS reflection attack from working because the spoofed packets would be dropped at the network boundaries, thus protecting potential victims.",['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/dns-amplification-ddos-attack/'],0,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.6948638763274821,0.0
