The enterprise uses OSPF at all sites, with one router connected to the service from each site. Which of the following are true about the Layer 3 details most likely used with this service and design? (Choose all that apply)","a. The WAN uses 20 or more IP subnets
b. A remote site router would have 20 OSPF neighbors
c. A remote site router would have one OSPF neighbor
d. The WAN uses one IP subnet
",,"b,d","c,d",,"The correct options are C and D. In this scenario, with OSPF being used at all sites, each router at a remote site would typically have one OSPF neighbor, which is the router connected to the service. This neighbor relationship is established over the WAN link. Additionally, since the WAN is a Metro Ethernet WAN with an Ethernet LAN (E-LAN) service, it is likely that the WAN uses one IP subnet for all the connected sites, providing a single broadcast domain for all sites.",['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/open-shortest-path-first-ospf/7039-1.html'],0,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.9,0.7342696770447382,0.0
