",,"b,d,e","a,b,e",,"a. Network slicing allows for isolation and resource allocation for different slices, preventing interference between them. This is a key feature provided by SDN controllers.

63,Which of the following are true about flow spaces? Select all that apply.,"a. Flow spaces can only be defined according to combinations of packet header fields.
b. Two controllers that write data-plane rules for non-overlapping parts of flowspace can never cause traffic from one “slice” to enter the other slice.
c. Two flow spaces cannot overlap.
d. Flowspace isolation separates individual virtual networks from one another but incurs some performance penalty for doing so.
e. One host could send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces.
",,e,"b,d,e",,"b. Two controllers can indeed write data-plane rules for non-overlapping parts of flowspace to prevent traffic from one 'slice' entering the other slice, ensuring isolation between the flows. This is a key aspect of flow space management. 
c. Overlapping flow spaces are possible, especially in scenarios where different controllers manage different parts of the network. 
d. Flowspace isolation is a fundamental concept in Software Defined Networking (SDN) to separate virtual networks, but it may incur a performance penalty due to the need for additional processing and enforcement of isolation. 
e. A single host can indeed send traffic that traverses different flow spaces based on the rules defined by the controllers managing those flow spaces.","['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352864816300035', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7461373']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,0.8487359638591103,0.1999999999999999
64,Which of the following describe the control-plane checks that FlowVisor implements? Select all that apply.,"a. When a packet must be forwarded to a controller, Flowvisor forwards traffic to the correct controller based on which controller “owns” the flowspace corresponding to that packet.
b. Flowvisor can only instantiate network slices based on the network topology, not based on other properties, such as application traffic.
c. Flowvisor prevents a controller from writing data-plane rules to a part of flowspace that it does not own.
d. Flowvisor installs traffic shaping and quality of service rules to ensure that each network slice has guaranteed resources.
e. Flowvisor prevents each slice's controller from being the target of a denial of service attack from other slices.
",,"a,c","a,c,e",,"a. FlowVisor forwards traffic to the correct controller based on ownership of the flowspace, which is a control-plane check. This ensures that the controller responsible for that part of the network processes the packet. c.
