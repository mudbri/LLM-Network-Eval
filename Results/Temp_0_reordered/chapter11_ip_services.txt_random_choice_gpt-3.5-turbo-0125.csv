You are responsible to find out why users are not being able to reach the Internet.","a. Dynamic NAT can't use Standard ACLs
b. The NAT pool does not have enough entries to fulfill the user's requests
c. The cause is not related to dynamic NAT
d. The command output does not provide any clue to identify the problem
",,b,b,,"The correct answer is B. The NAT pool configured with a total of 10 addresses has already allocated all of them (100% allocated). Since there are no more available addresses in the pool, new user requests to reach the Internet cannot be fulfilled.

Host A and host B attach to the same LAN and have correct default router settings per the FHRP configuration. Which of the following statements is true for this LAN?","a. If one router fails, both hosts will use the one remaining router as a default router

b. CoS
c. Delay
d. LLQ
e. Loss
f. Bandwidth
",,"a,c,e,f","a,b,c,d,e",,"The correct characteristics of network traffic that can be managed by Quality of Service (QoS) include: 
- Jitter: QoS can help manage and reduce jitter, which is the variation in packet delay. 
- CoS (Class of Service): QoS can prioritize different classes of traffic based on CoS values to ensure critical traffic gets preferential treatment. 
- Delay: QoS mechanisms can help control and minimize delays in transmitting packets across the network. 
- LLQ (Low Latency Queuing): LLQ is a QoS mechanism used to prioritize delay-sensitive traffic, ensuring low latency for critical applications. 
- Loss: QoS can mitigate packet loss by prioritizing important traffic and ensuring reliable delivery.
