1,Which of the following terms describe Ethernet addresses that can send one frame and is delivered to multiple devices on the LAN? (Choose two answers.),"a. Multicast address
b. Broadcast address
c. Unicast address
d. IP address
e. MAC address
",,"a,b","a,b",,The correct answers are A and B. A multicast address is used to send one frame and is delivered to multiple devices on the LAN. It is a group communication where information is addressed to a group of destination computers simultaneously. A broadcast address is also used to send one frame and is delivered to all devices on the LAN. It is a one-to-all communication where information is addressed to all devices on the network. Unicast addresses are used to send one frame and are delivered to a specific device. IP addresses are used for network layer communication and are not specific to Ethernet frames. MAC addresses uniquely identify devices on a network at the data link layer.,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_address', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_address']",1,chapter1_intro_to_networking,0.95,0.997665419458305,1.0
