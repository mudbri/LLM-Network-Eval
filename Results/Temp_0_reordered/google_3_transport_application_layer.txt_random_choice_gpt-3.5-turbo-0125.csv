b. Hub
c. Firewall
d. Switch

39,Which TCP flag is used to make the listening program respond immediately?,"a. ACK
b. PSH
c. URG
d. RST
",,b,b,,The PSH (Push) flag is used to make the listening program respond immediately by pushing the data to the receiving application without waiting to fill the maximum segment size (MSS). This flag is used to request that the data be pushed immediately to the receiving application.,['https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-flags/'],1,3_transport_application_layer,0.95,0.9999947998470208,1.0
