28,A Layer 2 switch configuration places all its physical ports into VLAN 2. The IP addressing plan shows that address 175.28.1.150 (with mask 255.255.255.0) is reserved for use by this new LAN switch and that 175.28.1.254 is already configured on the router connected to that same VLAN. The switch needs to support SSH connections into the switch from any subnet in the network. Which of the following commands are part of the required configuration in this case? (Choose two answers.),"a. The switch cannot support SSH because all its ports connect to VLAN 2, and the IP address must be configured on interface VLAN 1.
b. The ip address 175.28.1.150 255.255.255.0 command in interface vlan 2 configuration mode.
c. The ip default-gateway 175.28.1.254 command in global configuration mode.
d. The ip address 172.16.2.250 255.255.255.0 command in interface vlan 1 configuration mode.
e. The ip default-gateway 175.28.1.150 command in global configuration mode.","b,c","b,c","b,c","Option b is correct because to enable SSH connections to the switch, the switch needs to have an IP address configured on VLAN 2, which is the VLAN all ports are in. The 'ip address 175.28.1.150 255.255.255.0' command in interface VLAN 2 configuration mode assigns the specified IP address to the switch. Option c is also correct because the 'ip default-gateway 175.28.1.254' command in global configuration mode sets the default gateway for the switch to reach devices in other networks.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer provides a clear and accurate explanation for why options b and c are correct based on the scenario provided in the question. It correctly identifies the commands needed to configure the switch to support SSH connections and set the default gateway. Therefore, the original answer is correct.
