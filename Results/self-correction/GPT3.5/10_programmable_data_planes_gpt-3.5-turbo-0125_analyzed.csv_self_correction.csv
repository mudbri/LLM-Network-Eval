117,Why does a RouteBricks server assign one core per queue?,"a. Having multiple cores accessing the same queue would require each core to perform only one function in the packet processing pipeline, which is inefficient.
b. Having multiple cores accessing the same queue would require locking to prevent concurrent memory accesses, slowing packet forwarding performance.
c. Having multiple cores accessing the same queue might create the possibility that there is a queue that is not served by any cores.
d. Cores have heterogeneous performance, and packets are different sizes, so it makes sense to assign less powerful cores to queues that have smaller packets.
",b,b,a,"Having multiple cores accessing the same queue would require locking to prevent concurrent memory accesses, slowing packet forwarding performance. In a multi-core system, when multiple cores access the same queue concurrently, there is a risk of data corruption or inconsistency unless proper synchronization mechanisms like locks are in place. These locks introduce overhead due to contention for accessing the shared data structure, which can slow down packet processing.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer correctly explains that having multiple cores accessing the same queue would require locking to prevent concurrent memory accesses, which can slow down packet forwarding performance. However, it fails to mention other potential reasons why a RouteBricks server assigns one core per queue, such as efficiency in packet processing or ensuring that all queues are actively served.

Correct Answer: a
Having multiple cores accessing the same queue would require each core to perform only one function in the packet processing pipeline, which is inefficient.",1,0,10_programmable_data_planes,0.0
