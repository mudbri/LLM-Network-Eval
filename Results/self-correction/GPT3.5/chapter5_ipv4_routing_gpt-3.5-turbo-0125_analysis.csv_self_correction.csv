91,You have noticed that a server with IP 145.45.3.2 doesn’t respond to requests. What command will you type first in order to test connectivity between your device and the server?,"a. request 145.45.3.2
b. check 145.45.3.2
c. ping 145.45.3.2
d. ping 145.45.3.2",c,c,c,"The correct command to test connectivity between your device and the server with IP 145.45.3.2 is to use the 'ping' command followed by the IP address. This command sends ICMP echo requests to the specified IP address and waits for a response, helping to determine if the server is reachable and responsive.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer is mostly correct. It correctly identifies the command to test connectivity between devices as the 'ping' command followed by the IP address. However, it is redundant to include the incorrect options a, b, and d in the multiple-choice question.

92,"A LAN design uses a Layer 3 EtherChannel between two switches SW1 and SW2, with port-channel interface 1 used on both switches. SW1 uses ports G0/1 and G0/2 in the channel. However, only interface G0/1 is bundled into the channel and working. Think about the configuration settings on port G0/2 that could have existed before adding G0/2 to the EtherChannel. Which answers identify a setting that could prevent IOS from adding G0/2 to the Layer 3 EtherChannel? (Choose two answers.)","a. A different STP cost (spanning-tree cost value)
b. A different access VLAN (switchport access vlan vlanid)
c. A different speed (speed value)
d. A default setting for switchport (switchport)
","c,d","a,c","a,c","The settings that could prevent IOS from adding G0/2 to the Layer 3 EtherChannel are a different STP cost (spanning-tree cost value) and a different speed (speed value). If the STP cost or speed setting on G0/2 is different from G0/1, it can cause issues with EtherChannel formation and prevent G0/2 from being added to the channel.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer correctly identifies two settings that could prevent IOS from adding G0/2 to the Layer 3 EtherChannel. These settings are a different STP cost (spanning-tree cost value) and a different speed (speed value). The explanation provided is clear and accurate.

93,"A network engineer has configured a Layer 3 switch with SVIs for VLANs 4 and 5. Hosts in the subnets using VLANs 4 and 5 can ping each other with the Layer 3 switch routing the packets. The next week, the network engineer receives a call that those same users can no longer ping each other. If the problem is with the Layer 3 switching function, which of the following could have caused the problem? (Choose two answers.)","a. A shutdown command issued from VLAN 4 configuration mode
b. VTP on the switch removing VLAN 5 from the switch’s VLAN list
c. 1 out of 10 working VLAN 4 access ports failing due to physical problems
d. A shutdown command issued from VLAN 6 configuration mode","a,b","a,c","a,c","Option a could have caused the problem if a shutdown command was issued from VLAN 4 configuration mode, which would have disabled the interface associated with VLAN 4, leading to the loss of connectivity for hosts in that VLAN. Option c could also be a reason for the problem as if 1 out of 10 working VLAN 4 access ports failed due to physical issues, connectivity for hosts in VLAN 4 would be impacted, resulting in the inability to ping hosts in other VLANs.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer provides a valid explanation for why options a and c could cause the problem described in the scenario. These options correctly point out potential issues that could lead to the loss of connectivity between hosts in VLANs 4 and 5. Therefore, the original answer is accurate.

97,The commands ping and traceroute send messages in the network to test connectivity and rely on other devices to send back a reply,"a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",a,a,a,"The statement is true. Both the ping and traceroute commands are used to test connectivity in a network. Ping sends ICMP Echo Request messages to the destination device, and the device responds with an ICMP Echo Reply if it is reachable. Traceroute sends packets with increasing TTL values to trace the route to the destination and relies on intermediate devices to send back ICMP Time Exceeded messages, allowing it to map the network path.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer is correct. It provides a clear explanation of how the ping and traceroute commands work in testing network connectivity.

Therefore, a connected route for subnet 10.1.1.64 255.255.255.192 would be expected in the output. Additionally, since the IP address 10.1.1.100 is directly configured on the router interface, a connected route for subnet 10.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 would also be present.","Evaluation of original answer:
The answer provided is partially correct. 
- The explanation for the connected route for subnet 10.1.1.64 255.255.255.192 is accurate as it falls within the same network as the configured IP address/mask 10.1.1.100/26.
- However, the statement about a connected route for subnet 10.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 is incorrect. The directly connected route for the network 10.1.1.0/26 (which includes the IP address 10.1.1.100) would be expected, not 10.1.1.0/24.
