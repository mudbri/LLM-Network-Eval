211,Your company plans to start using public cloud service and now you are considering different WAN options. Your main concern is security by keeping the data private while also providing good QoS services. Which of the following options are under consideration? (Choose two answers.),"a. Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider
b. Using an Internet connection without VPN
c. Using an Internet connection with VPN
d. Using an intercloud exchange
","a,d","a,c","a,c","Option a (Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider) is a secure way to connect to the public cloud while maintaining data privacy. This option ensures that data travels over a dedicated private connection, offering better security and QoS. Option c (Using an Internet connection with VPN) is another secure option as VPN (Virtual Private Network) provides encryption and secure tunneling over the public Internet, ensuring data privacy and security.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer correctly identifies two secure options for connecting to the public cloud while maintaining data privacy and good QoS.
