54,Which of the following properties are characteristics of virtual networks (but not necessarily characteristics of SDN). Select all that apply.,"a. Separates the data and control plane.
b. Refactors network control so that network behavior is controlled from a single logically centralized controller.
c. Separates logical and physical networks.
d. Often deployed in data center networks to allow multiple tenants to share physical network infrastructure.
e. Abstracts the details of the physical network.
","c,d,e","c,d",c,"Option c is correct because virtual networks separate logical and physical networks, which is a characteristic of virtualization in general and not exclusive to SDN. Option d is also correct as virtual networks are often deployed in data center networks to enable multiple tenants to share the physical network infrastructure, a feature commonly associated with virtualization technologies.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer provided is partially correct. Option c is indeed a characteristic of virtual networks, specifically referring to the separation of logical and physical networks. However, option d is not entirely accurate. While virtual networks can be deployed in data center environments to enable multiple tenants to share physical network infrastructure, this characteristic is not exclusive to virtual networks and can also be a feature of Software-Defined Networking (SDN). SDN can facilitate network virtualization in data centers as well. Therefore, the statement that this characteristic applies to virtual networks but not necessarily to SDN is not entirely accurate.

c. A wide-area tunnel with Ethernet packet encapsulation enables the establishment of virtual links by encapsulating Ethernet packets within IP packets, facilitating communication between virtual machines.
d. VLAN switching based on VLAN tags is a method for creating virtual links by segregating network traffic based on VLAN identifiers, allowing for logical separation and communication within a network.

d. An emulation is easier to debug than a simulation.
e. Every run of the emulator will yield exactly the same results, resulting in reproducible experiments.
","b,c","b,c","b,c","Option b is correct because an emulator allows experiments to be 'ported' from one machine to another, which is a significant benefit compared to simulation. Option c is also correct as an emulator permits running real software on each of the nodes in the emulation, enhancing the realism and practicality of the experiments.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer is partially correct. Option b correctly identifies one of the benefits of emulation over simulation, which is the ability to ""port"" experiments from one machine to another.
