3,"In an ACL, if a traffic flow is not explicitly permitted, once it has expired testing all the user-configured control entries in the list, the result will be:","a. The traffic will be implicitly permitted.
b. The traffic will be explicitly permitted.
c. The traffic will be explicitly denied.
d. The traffic will be implicitly denied.
",d,d,a,"In an Access Control List (ACL), if a traffic flow is not explicitly permitted and all user-configured control entries have been tested without a match, the default behavior is to implicitly deny the traffic. This means that unless specifically permitted, the traffic will be implicitly denied at the end of the ACL.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer is incorrect. It states that the traffic will be implicitly denied, which is the correct behavior of an ACL when a flow is not explicitly permitted. However, the original answer incorrectly states option ""d"" as the result, which is ""The traffic will be implicitly denied."" The correct option should be ""a"" as per the explanation provided.

4,Which TCP flag must be set in a packet in order for the packet to match an ACL entry that contains the established keyword? Select one choice.,"a. SYN only
b. ACK only
c. RST only
d. SYN or ACK
e. ACK or RST
",e,b,d,"The correct option is 'b. ACK only'. When an ACL entry contains the 'established' keyword, it is looking for packets with the ACK flag set. This indicates that the connection has been established and is part of an existing session. SYN-only packets are used to initiate connections, while RST-only packets are used to terminate connections. SYN or ACK packets are used during the connection establishment phase, but for matching an ACL entry with the 'established' keyword, only ACK flag is necessary.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer correctly explains that when an ACL entry contains the 'established' keyword, it looks for packets with the ACK flag set. However, the explanation provided in the answer is accurate, but the selected option ""b. ACK only"" is not entirely correct. The answer should have mentioned that the ACK flag must be set and the RST flag must be unset for a packet to match an ACL entry with the 'established' keyword. This is because a packet with both the ACK and RST flags set would not be part of an established connection. Therefore, the answer could be improved by including this additional detail.
