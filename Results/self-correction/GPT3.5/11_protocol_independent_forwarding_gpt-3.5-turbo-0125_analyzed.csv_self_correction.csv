79,Which of the following best describes protocol independence?,"a. The ability to configure a packet parser in hardware that is agnostic to (and not constrained by) the control protocol.
b. The ability to evolve an existing control protocol without breaking interoperability.
c. The ability to run a switch independently from the controller.
d. The ability to support multiple protocols running in parallel on the same hardware.
e. The ability to run a network with both legacy OpenFlow switches and switches that support custom packet processing.
",a,"a,d","a,d","Protocol independence refers to the ability to configure a packet parser in hardware that is agnostic to (and not constrained by) the control protocol (option a). This allows the hardware to process packets without being tied to a specific control protocol. Additionally, protocol independence also involves the ability to support multiple protocols running in parallel on the same hardware (option d), enabling flexibility and interoperability in a Software Defined Networking (SDN) environment.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer provided is partially correct. It correctly identifies one aspect of protocol independence (option a) but misses another key aspect. The answer does not cover the full definition of protocol independence as it relates to supporting multiple protocols running in parallel on the same hardware (option d). This oversight limits the completeness of the explanation.

82,"Which of the following best describe the relationship between a language like P4, an assembler like NetASM, and target programmable hardware (e.g., RMT)?","a. P4 is much more amenable to ""cost semantics"" (i.e., figuring out how much a particular operation would cost in terms of power or area) than NetASM.
NetASM and P4 are two examples of high-level programming languages; they are interchangeable.
b. P4 has verifiable semantics, whereas NetASM does not.
c. A language like P4 would ""compile"" to an assembly language like NetASM, which would then specify a one-to-one relationship with resources on the target forwarding hardware.
d. A language like NetASM would ""compile"" to an assembly language like P4, which would then specify a one-to-one relationship with resources on the target forwarding hardware.",c,c,c,"The correct option is c. In the context of P4, NetASM, and target programmable hardware like RMT, P4 is designed to describe the high-level behavior of the data plane, while NetASM is an example of an assembler that can be used to specify low-level details. In this relationship, a language like P4 is typically used to define the high-level behavior, which would then be compiled to a lower-level representation like NetASM. NetASM, in turn, would specify a one-to-one mapping of resources on the target hardware, such as RMT.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer provided is accurate in explaining the relationship between P4, NetASM, and target programmable hardware (e.g., RMT). It correctly describes how a language like P4 would compile to an assembly language like NetASM, which would then specify a one-to-one relationship with resources on the target forwarding hardware. The explanation is clear and aligns with the concepts of high-level behavior description and low-level specification in this context.
