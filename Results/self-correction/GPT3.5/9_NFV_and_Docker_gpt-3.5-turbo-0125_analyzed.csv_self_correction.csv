72,"In NFV, which of the following is the function of steering?","a. Finding the best location to place a single network function in an enterprise or wide area network.
b. Installing custom packet processing code on servers in the network.
c. Placing middleboxes at places throughout the network to minimize network load.
d. Installing custom packet processing code on switches in the network.
e. Installing flow table entries in switches to forward traffic through network functions or middleboxes that are installed in the network
",e,a,e,The function of steering in NFV involves finding the best location to place a single network function in an enterprise or wide area network. This process helps in optimizing the network by determining the most suitable location for specific network functions to improve efficiency and performance.,"Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer provided is incorrect. The function of steering in Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is not about finding the best location to place a single network function in an enterprise or wide area network. Steering in NFV refers to the process of directing traffic flows to the appropriate network functions or virtualized network services based on specific policies or requirements.

74,What are some advantages of Docker containers over virtual machines? Select all that apply.,"a. Containers can be connected to build a virtual network, whereas virtual machines cannot.
b. Performance in containers may be better since they invoke OS system calls directly, rather than through an emulated machine.
c. Containers require less storage and memory per-instance, and require less time to instantiate than virtual machines.
d. Containers provide more flexibility in the choice of operating system.
e. Containers provide better isolation than virtual machines.
","b,c","b,c","b,c,e","Option b is correct because containers have better performance compared to virtual machines as they invoke OS system calls directly without the need for emulation. Option c is also correct as containers require less storage, memory per-instance, and time to instantiate than virtual machines.","Evaluation of original answer:
- Option a is incorrect. Both containers and virtual machines can be connected to build virtual networks.
- Option d is incorrect. Containers do not provide more flexibility in the choice of operating system compared to virtual machines.
- Option e is missing in the original answer. Containers do provide better isolation than virtual machines, which is an advantage.

75,Which of the following commands is used to instantiate a new Docker container by invoking a command in that container?,"a. docker stop
b. docker attach
c. docker commit
d. docker pull
e. docker run
",e,e,e,The correct command to instantiate a new Docker container by invoking a command in that container is the 'docker run' command. This command creates and starts a new container based on the specified image and can also run a specific command inside the container at the time of creation.,"Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer is accurate and provides a clear explanation of the correct command used to instantiate a new Docker container by invoking a command in that container.

76,Which of the following is true about networking Docker containers? Select all that apply.,"a. Docker containers can be networked to each other via the native Docker bridge or Open vSwitch.
b. A Docker container can never expose a low port (e.g., port 80) to the external Internet; Internet hosts must always reach a Docker service by a high port (e.g., 8080).
c. Docker containers running in different virtual machines cannot be networked together.
d. Connecting Docker containers requires setting up GRE tunnels between the containers.
e. Docker containers are not reachable from the external Internet by default.","a,e","a,e","a,e","a. Docker containers can be networked to each other via the native Docker bridge or Open vSwitch: This is true. Docker provides networking capabilities through the Docker bridge network or third-party solutions like Open vSwitch. These options allow containers to communicate with each other.
e. Docker containers are not reachable from the external Internet by default: This statement is generally true. By default, Docker containers are isolated from external networks for security reasons. To make a container reachable from the external Internet, specific networking configurations need to be implemented.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer provided for the question is mostly correct and provides accurate information regarding networking Docker containers. However, there is one minor issue with the explanation for option ""e.""

The statement ""Docker containers are not reachable from the external Internet by default"" is correct. However, the explanation that follows is slightly misleading. It states that specific networking configurations need to be implemented to make a container reachable from the external Internet, which is true. But it does not mention that Docker provides features like port mapping (-p option) to expose container ports to the host system and, consequently, to the external Internet.
