27,What are some of the motivations for using Layer-2 forwarding in a data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Ability to use existing routing protocols to establish paths between hosts.
b. Easier configuration/administration, since there is no need to number hosts or configure subnets.
c. Better security properties.
d. Better scaling properties.
e. Better load balancing properties.
",b,"a,d,e","a,d,e","Layer-2 forwarding in a data center offers the ability to use existing routing protocols to establish paths between hosts (option a). It also provides better scaling properties (option d) as Layer-2 forwarding simplifies the network design and reduces the complexity of routing tables. Additionally, Layer-2 forwarding can offer better load balancing properties (option e) by enabling traffic to be distributed across multiple paths efficiently.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer is partially correct. Options a, d, and e are valid motivations for using Layer-2 forwarding in a data center. However, the statement about easier configuration/administration (option b) and better security properties (option c) are not accurate. Layer-2 forwarding does not necessarily make configuration/administration easier, as it can introduce challenges related to broadcast domains and spanning tree protocols. Additionally, Layer-2 forwarding may not inherently provide better security properties compared to Layer-3 forwarding, which offers more granular control and segmentation.

28,How does the separation of the control and data plane make networking in data centers easier?,"a. Virtual machines can be migrated within the network without renumbering entire portions of the network or re-assigning network services to different IP addresses.
b. The control plane allows traffic to be forwarded using Layer 2 addresses, thus allowing automatic load balance across the topology.
c. The separation allows fewer switches to be used in the data center topology, thus lowering costs.
d. All routes can be controlled and monitored from a central point of control.
e. A network controller can permit the renumbering of end hosts to have topology-dependent Layer 2 MAC addresses.","a,d,e","a,d","a,d","The separation of the control and data plane in Software Defined Networking (SDN) makes networking in data centers easier for the following reasons:

a. Virtual machines can be migrated within the network without renumbering entire portions of the network or re-assigning network services to different IP addresses: This is a key advantage of SDN where the control plane can dynamically update forwarding rules to accommodate VM migrations without the need for manual reconfiguration of network elements.

b. The control plane allows traffic to be forwarded using Layer 2 addresses, thus allowing automatic load balance across the topology: This statement is not entirely accurate as load balancing is typically a function of the data plane and the SDN controller's decisions based on network conditions.

c. The separation allows fewer switches to be used in the data center topology, thus lowering costs: While SDN can optimize network resource utilization, the primary benefit is not necessarily reducing the number of switches but rather improving network flexibility and management.

d. All routes can be controlled and monitored from a central point of control: This is a significant advantage of SDN where a centralized controller can manage and monitor the network, leading to better visibility, control, and troubleshooting capabilities.

e. A network controller can permit the renumbering of end hosts to have topology-dependent Layer 2 MAC addresses: This statement is not directly related to the benefits of separating the control and data plane in SDN.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer provides a detailed explanation of how the separation of the control and data plane in Software Defined Networking (SDN) makes networking in data centers easier. It correctly identifies the benefits of virtual machines migration without renumbering the network and the centralized control and monitoring of routes. However, it includes an inaccurate statement about load balancing being a function of the control plane, which is incorrect. Additionally, the mention of reducing the number of switches as a benefit is not entirely accurate. The last point about renumbering end hosts with topology-dependent Layer 2 MAC addresses is not directly related to the separation of the control and data plane in SDN.

32,"Which property guarantees that each RCP replica continues to install correct forwarding state in the network data plane, even in the case of a partition in the data plane?","a. Each controller has a complete view of the portion of the network that it is controlling, and therefore can guarantee consistent routing within that partition.
b. The controller cannot see many of the routers in the network anyway, so there is no way for it to install incorrect routing state in the routers that it is not connected to.
c. The controllers are partitioned from the network routers, and the routers will fall back to running a distributed routing protocol.
d. Running the network from a single high-level control plane guarantees that network partitions and loops never occur in the first place.
