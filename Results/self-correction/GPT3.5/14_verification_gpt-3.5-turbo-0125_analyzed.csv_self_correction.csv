106,Which of the following are true about configuration verification? Select all that apply.,"a. Configuration verification can only detect errors after the configuration is installed on production routers.
b. Configuration verification cannot detect incorrect protocol behavior that may result from faulty hardware.
c. Verifying the correctness of network behavior based on configuration requires a model of protocol behavior.
d. Configuration verification requires a large-scale simulation of network protocols, complete with tests for different message orderings and timings.
e. Configuration verification cannot detect incorrect protocol behavior that may result from buggy software.
","b,c,e",c,"a,b,c,e","Option c is correct because verifying the correctness of network behavior based on configuration indeed requires a model of protocol behavior. This is essential to ensure that the configuration aligns with the expected behavior of the network protocols in use. Options a, b, d, and e are incorrect. Option a is incorrect because configuration verification tools can be used before deploying configurations to production routers to catch errors early. Option b is incorrect because configuration verification can indeed detect incorrect protocol behavior resulting from faulty hardware. Option d is incorrect because while simulation can be part of the verification process, it is not always necessary to have large-scale simulations for basic verification. Option e is incorrect because configuration verification can indeed help detect incorrect protocol behavior resulting from buggy software.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer provides a clear explanation for each option; however, there is a significant issue with the accuracy of the information provided. Options a, b, d, and e are labeled as incorrect, but the explanations provided are inaccurate. Configuration verification tools can indeed address the concerns mentioned in these options. Therefore, the original answer is not entirely correct.

107,"Which of the following assertions could be verified with configuration verification (i.e., of a snapshot of router and switch configuration)? Select all that apply.","a. A route learned from one peer will not be readvertised to another peer.
b. The current settings of link weights will result in all routers being connected.
c. The configuration of route reflectors and clients ensures that any route learned from a neighboring AS will propagate to all routers in the topology.
d. There is no traffic pattern that would ever result in a stateful firewall dropping traffic.
e. Any time that an infection occurs, hosts are automatically quarantined.

108,Which of the following are true about data-plane verification? Select all that apply.,"a. Data-plane verification techniques such as header-space analysis typically operate on a single ""snapshot"" of data-plane state.
b. Data plane verification can only operate on the forwarding table of a single router or switch; network-wide analysis is not possible.
c. Data-plane verification may detect errors that configuration analysis can miss in the cases of buggy control-plane software.
d. Data-plane verification requires accurate modeling of network protocols, including which bits are present in which part of the packet header.
e. Header-space analysis can only provide verification/analysis for specific packets; it cannot answer questions for general parts of flowspace.
","a,c","a,c,d","a,c,d","a. Data-plane verification techniques such as header-space analysis typically operate on a single 'snapshot' of data-plane state: This is true as data-plane verification techniques often analyze the current state of the network to identify potential issues.
c. Data-plane verification may detect errors that configuration analysis can miss in the cases of buggy control-plane software: This is correct as data-plane verification looks at the actual behavior of the network, which can uncover issues that traditional configuration analysis might overlook.
d. Data-plane verification requires accurate modeling of network protocols, including which bits are present in which part of the packet header: Accurate modeling of network protocols is essential for data-plane verification to analyze packet headers and ensure correct network behavior.","Evaluation of original answer:
The answer provided is accurate and correctly identifies the true statements about data-plane verification.

109,Which of the following assertions could be verified with data plane verification? Select all that apply.,"a. The network will remain connected, given the failure of at most two links.
b. Two virtual network ""slices"" are not completely isolated: it is possible for traffic to travel from one slice to the other.
c. The configuration of the network's routing protocols will result in persistent oscillation (i.e., they will never settle on a stable set of routes).
d. The forwarding table state in the routers across the network will result in a forwarding loop.
e. The rules installed on the firewalls in the network ensure that only port 80 traffic can ever reach the web server from the rest of the Internet.","b,d,e","b,e","b,e","{'b': 'Data plane verification can be used to check if traffic can flow between different network slices, ensuring they are not completely isolated.', 'e': 'Data plane verification can validate if the rules on firewalls are correctly implemented to only allow specific traffic (in this case, port 80 traffic) to reach the web server.'}","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer correctly identifies two assertions that can be verified with data plane verification. Option b states that data plane verification can confirm if traffic can flow between different network slices, ensuring they are not completely isolated. Option e mentions that data plane verification can validate if the rules on firewalls are correctly implemented to only allow specific traffic (in this case, port 80 traffic) to reach the web server. However, the other options do not align with the capabilities of data plane verification.

110,Which of the following is true about Kinetic policies? Select all that apply.,"a. State transitions can be exogenous or endogenous.
b. Kinetic's NuSMV verifier can verify that the data plane will never have loops.
c. State transitions can occur based on timing (e.g., a timeout).
d. The Kinetic controller can only process external events from routers and switches.
e. Pyretic's composition operators can help prevent state explosion.
","a,c,e","a,c","a,c","a. State transitions can be exogenous or endogenous: This is true. In Kinetic policies, state transitions can be triggered by events within the network (endogenous) or by external factors (exogenous).

112,"Which of the following NuSMV expressions encodes the statement ""It is always possible for the policy state to go to 'allow'.""","a. SPEC AG (!authenticated -> AX policy=allow)
b. None of the above.
c. SPEC A [ policy=allow U authenticated ]
d. SPEC AG (authenticated -> AX policy=allow)
e. SPEC AG (EF policy=allow)
",e,d,d,"Option d (SPEC AG (authenticated -> AX policy=allow)) correctly encodes the statement 'It is always possible for the policy state to go to 'allow'.' This expression specifies globally (AG) that if the system is in the 'authenticated' state, then in the next state (AX), the policy state should be 'allow', ensuring that it is always possible for the policy state to transition to 'allow'. Option a is incorrect as it does not ensure the possibility for the policy state to transition to 'allow'. Option c encodes a different property related to the 'allow' state but not the possibility of transition. Options b and e are also incorrect as they do not accurately represent the given statement.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer provides a clear explanation of why option d is correct and why the other options are incorrect. It correctly identifies option d as the one that encodes the statement ""It is always possible for the policy state to go to 'allow'."" Therefore, the original answer is accurate and well-explained.
