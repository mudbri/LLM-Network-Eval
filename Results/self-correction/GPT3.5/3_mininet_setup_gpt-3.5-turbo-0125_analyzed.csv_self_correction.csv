16,Which of the following command is used to generate an OpenFlow network topology consisting of a single switch and 8 hosts with randomly generated MAC addresses for each host?,"a. sudo mn --topo single,8  --switch ovsk --controller remote
b. sudo mn --topo single,3 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
c. sudo mn --topo single,8 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
d. sudo mn --topo linear,8  --switch ovsk --controller remote",a,c,c,"The correct command to generate an OpenFlow network topology consisting of a single switch and 8 hosts with randomly generated MAC addresses for each host is 'sudo mn --topo single,8 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote'. The '--topo single,8' specifies a single switch with 8 hosts, the '--mac' flag indicates that MAC addresses should be randomly generated for each host, '--switch ovsk' selects the switch type as Open vSwitch, and '--controller remote' sets the controller type as remote.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer correctly identifies the correct command to generate an OpenFlow network topology consisting of a single switch and 8 hosts with randomly generated MAC addresses for each host. The explanation provided also breaks down the command and its components accurately.

Correct Answer: c",0,0,3_mininet_setup,0.0
17,What is the purpose of --mac flag used in mininet?,"a. Generates random MAC addresses for the hosts.
b. Generates sequential MAC addresses for the hosts, matching their IP address.
c. Generates sequential MAC addresses for the switch ports, matching their IP address.
d. Generates random MAC addresses for the switch ports.
",b,b,a,"The --mac flag in Mininet generates sequential MAC addresses for the hosts, matching their IP address. This option helps in creating a predictable mapping between the IP and MAC addresses of the hosts, which can be useful for various networking configurations and troubleshooting scenarios.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer is incorrect. The explanation provided for option b is accurate, but the option itself is incorrect. The --mac flag in Mininet does not generate sequential MAC addresses for the hosts matching their IP address.

Correct Answer: (a)",1,0,3_mininet_setup,0.0
20,"What is the purpose of dpctl, provided with mininet?","a. To enable visibility and control over a single switchâ€™s flow table.
b. To enable visibility and control over multiple switch flow table.
c. Is an OpenFlow controller.
",a,a,a,"The purpose of dpctl, provided with Mininet, is to enable visibility and control over a single switch's flow table. It is used for managing individual switches within a Mininet network.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer correctly explains that dpctl is used to enable visibility and control over a single switch's flow table within Mininet, which is accurate.

Correct Answer: a",1,1,3_mininet_setup,1.0
