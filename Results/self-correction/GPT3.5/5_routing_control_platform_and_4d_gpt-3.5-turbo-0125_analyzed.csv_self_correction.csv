32,What are some of the reasons that it is difficult to deploy improvements to BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. Changes are necessarily incremental because of the large installed base of routers that already run BGP.
b. BGP is implemented in hardware, so deploying changes to BGP requires changes on the timescale of hardware development cycles.
c. Deplyoing changes to BGP requires coordination across potentially tens of thousands of ASes in the Internet.
d. Only a few vendors implement BGP, and deploying changes requires convincing those vendors to change the protocol.
e. Deploying changes requires coordination in standards bodies such as the IETF.
","a,c,e","a,c,e","a,c,e","a. Changes are necessarily incremental because of the large installed base of routers that already run BGP: BGP has a vast installed base, and any changes need to be backward compatible to ensure smooth transitions.
c. Deploying changes to BGP requires coordination across potentially tens of thousands of ASes in the Internet: BGP operates across numerous Autonomous Systems (ASes), making it challenging to coordinate changes across all these entities.
e. Deploying changes requires coordination in standards bodies such as the IETF: BGP changes need to go through standardization processes in bodies like the IETF to ensure interoperability and compatibility.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer provides accurate reasons why it is difficult to deploy improvements to BGP. These reasons include the incremental nature of changes due to the large installed base of routers running BGP, the coordination required across numerous ASes in the Internet, and the need for coordination in standards bodies like the IETF. Therefore, the original answer is correct.

b. The second phase of RCP deployment offers potential benefits such as reduced routing table size.
c. In the second phase of deployment, the RCP controller sees all routes for every destination that neighboring ASes advertise.
d. The second phase of deployment requires fewer BGP sessions at the RCP controller than the first phase, thus improving scalability of the controller.
e. In the second phase of RCP deployment, ASes do not need to use BGP to exchange routes with one another.
","b,c","b,c","b,c","Option b is correct because one of the potential benefits of the second phase of RCP deployment is indeed reduced routing table size. Option c is also true as in the second phase of deployment, the RCP controller sees all routes for every destination that neighboring ASes advertise, which helps in making better routing decisions.","Evaluation of original answer:
Option a is incorrect. The second phase of RCP deployment does require coordination with neighboring ASes.
Option d is incorrect. The second phase of deployment actually requires more BGP sessions at the RCP controller than the first phase, which may impact scalability negatively.
Option e is incorrect. ASes still need to use BGP to exchange routes with one another in the second phase of RCP deployment.

","a,b,c","a,d","a,d","In the 4D architecture, the separate decision plane can amortize system overhead by performing tasks like maintaining a single table in memory of AS paths learned across all BGP sessions to save memory (option a) and performing route computation on behalf of all routers in the AS (option d). Option b is related to security measures and not directly linked to amortizing system overhead. Option c, keeping track of topology information, is more related to the control plane rather than specifically amortizing system overhead. Option e, performing inbound traffic engineering, is more about optimizing traffic flow rather than amortizing system overhead.","Evaluation of original answer:
Option a correctly explains how a separate decision plane in the 4D architecture can amortize system overhead by maintaining a single table in memory of AS paths learned across all BGP sessions. This helps save memory by using references into that table for specific routers. 
Option d is also correct as performing route computation on behalf of all routers in the AS can help reduce individual router processing load and contribute to amortizing system overhead.
Options b, c, and e are incorrect as they are not directly related to amortizing system overhead in the context of the 4D architecture.
