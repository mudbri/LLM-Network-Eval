96,"In PortLand, what are the reasons for assigning hosts pseudo-MAC addresses, as opposed to simply forwarding traffic on physical MAC addresses? Select all that apply.","a. Hosts in the data-center network topology are more vulnerable to attack if they expose their actual physical MAC addresses, rather than having a layer of indirection.
b. It is very difficult to load balance traffic using physical MAC addresses; pseudo MAC addresses make it possible to assign traffic to destination IP addresses.
c. Without pseudo-MAC addresses, switches would have to update forwarding state whenever hosts with a particular MAC address moved from one portion of the topology to another.
d. Forwarding loops are be more common in a flat layer-2 topology than they are in a topology with hierarchical pseudo MAC addresses.
e. In a flat layer-2 topology, switches cannot know on which port to forward traffic without maintaining switch tables for each MAC address, since MAC addresses are flat, not hierarchical.","c,e","a,c","a,c","a. Hosts in the data-center network topology are more vulnerable to attack if they expose their actual physical MAC addresses, rather than having a layer of indirection: Assigning hosts pseudo-MAC addresses adds a layer of security by not exposing the actual physical MAC addresses of the hosts to potential attackers. c. Without pseudo-MAC addresses, switches would have to update forwarding state whenever hosts with a particular MAC address moved from one portion of the topology to another: Pseudo-MAC addresses help in decoupling the host's physical location from its MAC address, allowing easier movement without requiring constant updates in the network's forwarding state.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer provides accurate reasons for assigning hosts pseudo-MAC addresses in PortLand. The explanations for both options a and c are well-supported and align with the benefits of using pseudo-MAC addresses in a network topology. Therefore, the original answer is correct.

98,"What are some of the disadvantages of today's interdomain routing protocol, BGP? Select all that apply.","a. ISPs cannot load-balance traffic across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix.
b. Routing and forwarding decisions are only based on IP prefix, not on a broader range of traffic flow attributes.
c. ISPs can only influence route selection through indirect mechanisms (e.g., prepending), rather than directly manipulating the forwarding table entries in switches.
d. ISPs cannot express preference of one route over another, given multiple routes to a destination.
e. ISPs can only influence the routing decisions of their immediate neighbor, not the entire end-to-end path.
","b,c,e","a,b,c,d","a,b,c,d","a. ISPs cannot load-balance traffic across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix: BGP does not inherently support traffic load balancing across multiple paths to the same destination. Each BGP route is associated with a single next-hop, limiting load-balancing capabilities. b. Routing and forwarding decisions are only based on IP prefix, not on a broader range of traffic flow attributes: BGP's decision-making is primarily based on destination IP prefix and AS-path information, lacking visibility into other traffic attributes that could lead to more efficient routing decisions. c. ISPs can only influence route selection through indirect mechanisms (e.g., prepending), rather than directly manipulating the forwarding table entries in switches: BGP route selection is based on policy configurations and attributes like AS-path prepending, but ISPs do not have direct control over the forwarding table entries in switches. d. ISPs cannot express preference of one route over another, given multiple routes to a destination: BGP lacks the ability to express granular preferences for specific routes when multiple paths are available to a destination.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the disadvantages of BGP in terms of load balancing, routing decisions, route selection mechanisms, and expressing preferences for routes. The explanations for each selected option are clear and accurate, highlighting the limitations of BGP in these aspects.
