110,"Given the following OSPF network commands,
type the wildcard masks to match the requirement.
Requirement: Match addresses that begin with 110.20
Command: network 110.20.0.0 {wildcard mask}
Which of the following wildcard mask will you use to meet the
requirement?","a. 0.0.255.255
b. 0.0.0.255
c. 0.255.255.255
d. 0.0.0.0",a,a,a,"The correct wildcard mask to match addresses that begin with 110.20 is 0.0.255.255. In OSPF wildcard masks, '0' bits indicate the bits that must match exactly, while '1' bits are don't care bits. Since we want to match addresses that start with 110.20, the first two octets (110.20) should be exact, and the last two octets can vary, hence 0.0.255.255 is the appropriate wildcard mask.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer provides a clear explanation of how wildcard masks work in OSPF and correctly identifies the wildcard mask needed to match addresses that begin with 110.20. Therefore, the original answer is correct.

This command matches the specific IP addresses and their corresponding subnet masks to activate OSPF on those interfaces.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer provided is incorrect. The command 'network 20.0.0.1 0.0.0.255 area 0' does not correctly match the IP addresses 20.1.20.1, 20.1.30.1, and 20.1.40.1 with their subnet masks. The subnet mask in the given command is too broad and does not accurately represent the specific IP addresses mentioned.

118,A network engineer connects routers R5 and R6 to the same Ethernet LAN and configures them to use OSPFv2. Which answers describe a combination of settings that would prevent the two routers from becoming OSPF neighbors?,"a. Both routers’ interface IP addresses are in the same subnet
b. Both routers’ OSPF process uses process ID 3
c. Both routers’ OSPF process uses router ID 42.42.42.42
d. Both routers’ interfaces use an OSPF Dead interval of 80",c,"b,c",b,"In OSPF, for routers to become neighbors, they must have the same OSPF process ID and different router IDs. By having the same OSPF process ID (option b) and the same router ID (option c), routers R5 and R6 would not become OSPF neighbors.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer is partially correct. Option b correctly states that having the same OSPF process ID would prevent the routers from becoming OSPF neighbors. However, option c is incorrect. In OSPF, routers can become neighbors even if they have the same router ID, as long as their IP addresses are different. Therefore, having the same router ID alone would not prevent the routers from becoming OSPF neighbors.

",b,c,a,"RIP (Routing Information Protocol) has a default Administrative Distance (AD) of 120, not 110. Therefore, among the given options, none of them have 110 as the default AD except for RIP.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer correctly states that RIP has a default Administrative Distance (AD) of 120, not 110. However, it incorrectly concludes that none of the given options have 110 as the default AD except for RIP. This is not accurate as there may be other routing protocols with an AD of 110.
