1,Which of the following terms describe Ethernet addresses that can send one frame and is delivered to multiple devices on the LAN? (Choose two answers.),"a. Broadcast address
b. Multicast address
c. IP address
d. MAC address
e. Unicast address
","a,b","a,b",a,"Broadcast address and Multicast address are the terms used to describe Ethernet addresses that can send one frame and are delivered to multiple devices on the LAN. A broadcast address is used to send data to all devices on the network, while a multicast address is used to send data to a specific group of devices.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer is partially correct. The term ""Broadcast address"" is indeed used to describe Ethernet addresses that can send one frame and are delivered to multiple devices on the LAN. However, the term ""Multicast address"" is used to send data to a specific group of devices, not necessarily multiple devices on the LAN. Therefore, the explanation provided for the Multicast address is not entirely accurate.

3,___________ is a set of rules determining how network devices respond when two devices attempt to use a data channel simultaneously and encounter a data collision.,"a. CSMA/CD
b. CSMA/CA
c. TCP/IP
d. TCP/UDP
",a,a,a,"The correct option is a. CSMA/CD. CSMA/CD stands for Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection. It is a set of rules used in Ethernet networks to manage how devices respond when they detect that two devices are trying to transmit data at the same time. In such cases, a collision is detected, and CSMA/CD helps in handling these collisions by backing off and retransmitting the data after a random time interval to avoid further collisions.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer is accurate and provides a clear explanation of CSMA/CD and its role in managing data collisions in Ethernet networks.

14,"If the devices below were connected with UTP Ethernet cables, which pairs of devices would require a straight-through cable? (Choose two answers.)","a. Router and PC
b. Switch and PC
c. Hub and switch
d. Router and hub
","b,d","a,c","a,d","Devices that require a straight-through cable are those that have different wiring schemes on their Ethernet ports. A straight-through cable is used to connect devices with different types of ports, where the transmit pins on one device are connected to the receive pins on the other. In this case, a router and a PC, as well as a hub and a switch, have different wiring schemes on their ports and would require a straight-through cable.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer correctly identifies that a straight-through cable is used to connect devices with different types of ports. However, the explanation provided for the pairs of devices that would require a straight-through cable is incorrect. The correct explanation should be based on the fact that devices like routers, PCs, hubs, and switches have different pin configurations on their Ethernet ports, which determines whether a straight-through or crossover cable is needed.
