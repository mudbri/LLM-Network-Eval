c. A controller can prevent one network slice from interfering with the resources of another.
d. Multi-tenant datacenters are one use case for network slicing.
e. Conventional (i.e., non-SDN) networks have no concept of network virtualization or slicing.

63,Which of the following are true about flow spaces? Select all that apply.,"a. Two flow spaces cannot overlap.
b. One host could send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces.
c. Flow spaces can only be defined according to combinations of packet header fields.
d. Flowspace isolation separates individual virtual networks from one another but incurs some performance penalty for doing so.
e. Two controllers that write data-plane rules for non-overlapping parts of flowspace can never cause traffic from one “slice” to enter the other slice.
",b,"b,d","b,d","{'b': 'One host could send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces. This statement is true because a single host can generate traffic that matches rules in multiple flow spaces, causing its traffic to be handled differently based on the defined rules.', 'd': 'Flowspace isolation separates individual virtual networks from one another but incurs some performance penalty for doing so. This statement is true because while flowspace isolation provides network segmentation and security benefits by separating virtual networks, it can introduce overhead and performance penalties due to the additional processing required for enforcing isolation.'}","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer provides accurate explanations for statements b and d. These statements correctly describe aspects of flow spaces. Therefore, the original answer is correct.

64,Which of the following describe the control-plane checks that FlowVisor implements? Select all that apply.,"a. When a packet must be forwarded to a controller, Flowvisor forwards traffic to the correct controller based on which controller “owns” the flowspace corresponding to that packet.
b. Flowvisor prevents each slice's controller from being the target of a denial of service attack from other slices.
c. Flowvisor can only instantiate network slices based on the network topology, not based on other properties, such as application traffic.
d. Flowvisor prevents a controller from writing data-plane rules to a part of flowspace that it does not own.
e. Flowvisor installs traffic shaping and quality of service rules to ensure that each network slice has guaranteed resources.
