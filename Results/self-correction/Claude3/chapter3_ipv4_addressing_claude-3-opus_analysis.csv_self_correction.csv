42,Why does the formula for the number of hosts per subnet (2H â€“ 2) require the subtraction of two hosts?,"a. To reserve two addresses for redundant default gateways(routers)

",c,c,c,"The formula for calculating the number of usable host addresses per subnet (2^H - 2) requires subtracting two addresses to reserve them for the subnet ID (network address) and the subnet broadcast address. These two addresses cannot be assigned to hosts. The subnet ID represents the network itself, while the broadcast address is used to send packets to all hosts within the subnet.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The formula for calculating the number of usable host addresses per subnet (2^H - 2) subtracts two addresses to reserve them for the subnet ID (network address) and the subnet broadcast address. These two addresses cannot be assigned to individual hosts because they serve special purposes within the subnet.

The subnet ID, also known as the network address, represents the network itself and is used to identify the subnet. It is the first address in the subnet and is calculated by setting all host bits to zero.

The subnet broadcast address is used to send packets to all hosts within the subnet simultaneously. It is the last address in the subnet and is calculated by setting all host bits to one.

The other options are incorrect:
a. Redundant default gateways are not related to the subtraction of two addresses in the host calculation formula.
b. DHCP operation does not require reserving two addresses in each subnet.
d. While the default gateway (router) address is often the first usable host address in a subnet, it is not subtracted from the total number of hosts.

Among the given choices, only 10.0.0.56 falls within a private IP range that could use the 255.255.255.0 subnet mask.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is partially correct. While it correctly identifies that 10.0.0.56 is the only private IP address among the choices, the reasoning about the subnet mask is flawed. The default subnet mask for the 10.0.0.0/8 network is indeed 255.0.0.0. However, this does not mean that 10.0.0.56 cannot have a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. Subnetting allows network administrators to divide larger networks into smaller subnets, and the 10.0.0.0/8 network can be subnetted using a 255.255.255.0 subnet mask. Therefore, the answer is correct, but the explanation needs improvement.

Correct Answer: d. The IP address 10.0.0.56 can indeed have a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. This is because the 10.0.0.0/8 network, which is a private IP address range, can be subnetted using a 255.255.255.0 subnet mask. Subnetting allows the creation of smaller networks within the larger 10.0.0.0/8 network.

",a,a,a,"The first octet range for Class A IP networks is indeed 1 to 126. Class A networks use a default subnet mask of 255.0.0.0 and have 0 to 127 as their first octet values. However, the values 0 and 127 are reserved. 0.0.0.0/8 is used for broadcast messages to the current network and 127.0.0.0/8 is reserved for loopback addresses, so the actual usable range for Class A networks is 1 to 126.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. Class A IP networks have a first octet range of 1 to 126. While the theoretical range for Class A is 0 to 127, the 0 and 127 values are reserved and cannot be used for actual network addresses. 0.0.0.0/8 has a special use for broadcast messages to the current ""this"" network, and 127.0.0.0/8 is reserved for loopback functionality.

The optimal number of subnet bits is therefore 7 - 1 = 6 bits, as this will provide 2^6 = 64 subnets, with room for future growth up to 100 subnets.

Class C networks have a first octet range of 192 to 223, allowing for 2,097,152 Class C networks, each supporting up to 254 hosts.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. Class C IP addresses have a range of 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255, with the first octet being between 192 and 223 (inclusive). Each Class C network can support up to 254 hosts, as the last octet is used for host addresses, and the values 0 and 255 are reserved for the network address and broadcast address, respectively.

60,"The senior network engineer asked you to choose the last usable address for a host from the last subnet according to the following details:
Network 9.0.0.0 (Class A)
Mask 255.255.0.0 (for all subnets)","a. 9.255.255.254

The last subnet in this network would be 9.255.0.0/16. The last usable host address in this subnet is obtained by setting all host bits to 1 except the last bit, which is set to 0. This results in the IP address 9.255.255.254, which is the last usable host address in the last subnet of the given network.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer and explanation are correct. The network 9.0.0.0 with mask 255.255.0.0 is indeed a Class A network divided into 256 subnets, each with 65,534 usable host addresses. The last subnet is 9.255.0.0/16, and the last usable host address in this subnet is 9.255.255.254, obtained by setting all host bits to 1 except the last bit, which is set to 0.

61,The first octet range from the Class B IP networks is 1 - 126.,"a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",b,b,b,"The first octet range for Class B IP networks is 128 to 191, not 1 to 126. Class A networks use the first octet range of 1 to 126. Therefore, the statement is false.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The provided explanation accurately points out that the first octet range for Class B IP networks is 128 to 191, not 1 to 126. It also correctly mentions that the 1 to 126 range is used by Class A networks instead. The answer correctly identifies the statement as false.

62,A network designer asked you how many subnet (S) bits does he need to create 5 subnets?,"a. 2
b. 3
c. 4
d. 5",b,b,b,"To determine the number of subnet bits needed, use the formula 2^n >= x, where n is the number of subnet bits and x is the desired number of subnets. In this case, we need at least 5 subnets. Testing the values:  2^2 = 4 (not enough) 2^3 = 8 (sufficient)  Therefore, 3 subnet bits are required to create 5 subnets.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The explanation provided accurately describes how to determine the number of subnet bits required based on the desired number of subnets. The formula 2^n >= x is used, where n is the number of subnet bits and x is the number of subnets needed. Testing the values shows that 2^2 = 4 is insufficient, but 2^3 = 8 provides enough subnets to meet the requirement of 5. Therefore, the correct answer is that 3 subnet bits are needed.

It accurately identifies the three choices that fall within the defined private IP address ranges specified in RFC 1918:

- 172.31.100.0 is within the 172.16.0.0/12 private range

The other choices (164.16.2.0, 192.166.255.0, 11.11.11.0) are correctly excluded as they do not match any of the private IP ranges.

The explanation provided is clear and references the relevant RFC that defines the private IP address space allocations.
