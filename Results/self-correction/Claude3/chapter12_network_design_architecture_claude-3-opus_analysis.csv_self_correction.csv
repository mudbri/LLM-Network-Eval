205,____________________ is a network design that connects a link between each pair of nodes.,"a. Full Mesh
b. Star
c. Hybrid
d. Partial Mesh
",a,a,a,"A full mesh network topology is one where every node (device) is connected to every other node in the network. This means there is a direct link between each pair of nodes, allowing for maximum redundancy and performance. However, this also makes full mesh very costly and impractical for large networks due to the high number of connections required.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. In a full mesh network topology, each node is directly connected to every other node, forming a complete graph. This provides maximum redundancy and performance, as there are direct paths between all nodes without the need for intermediate hops. However, the main drawback of a full mesh topology is the high cost and complexity due to the large number of connections required, which grows exponentially with the number of nodes. This makes full mesh impractical for large networks.
