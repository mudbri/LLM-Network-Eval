163,Which of the following options are things that a standard IP ACL could be configured to do? (Choose two answers.),"a. Match the exact source IP address
b. Match all IP addresses in a subnet with one access-list command without matching other IP addresses
c. Match IP addresses 20.2.2.2 through 20.2.2.22 with one access-list command without matching other IP addresses
d. Match only the packetâ€™s destination IP address","a,b","a,d","a,d","A standard IP access control list (ACL) can match the exact source IP address of packets using a command like 'access-list 1 permit 10.1.1.1'. It can also match only the packet's destination IP address by applying the ACL to inbound traffic on an interface. However, a standard ACL cannot match a range of addresses or a subnet without also including other IP addresses, as those capabilities require an extended ACL.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. A standard IP ACL can indeed match an exact source IP address and be applied to filter packets based on their destination IP address. The explanation provided is also accurate in stating that standard ACLs cannot match a range of addresses or a specific subnet without including other IP addresses, as those capabilities are only available in extended ACLs.

164,"One of the differences between named and numbered ACLs is that named ACLS using ACL subcommands, not global commands, to define the action and matching parameters.","a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",a,a,a,"The statement is true. Named ACLs use ACL subcommands within the named ACL configuration mode to define the action (permit or deny) and matching parameters (source IP, destination IP, protocol, etc.). In contrast, numbered ACLs use global configuration commands to define the action and matching parameters directly under the global configuration mode.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. Named ACLs indeed use ACL subcommands within the named ACL configuration mode to define the action (permit or deny) and matching parameters, as opposed to numbered ACLs which use global configuration commands directly.

165,"Given the following fields, which of those cannot be compared on an extended IP ACL?","a. Application protocol
b. Destination IP address
c. Source IP address
d. URL
e. TOS Byte
",d,"d,e","d,e","Extended IP ACLs cannot compare URLs or the TOS byte. They can filter based on the application protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP), source IP address, and destination IP address. However, filtering based on URLs requires more advanced features like a firewall or web content filtering. The TOS (Type of Service) byte is also not a filterable field in standard extended IP ACLs.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. Extended IP access control lists (ACLs) do not have the capability to filter based on URLs or the TOS (Type of Service) byte. The key filterable fields for extended IP ACLs are:

- Protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP)
- Source IP address 
- Destination IP address
- Source port (for TCP/UDP)
- Destination port (for TCP/UDP)

Filtering based on URLs requires more advanced functionality typically found in firewalls or web content filters. The TOS byte, while part of the IP header, is not a filterable field in standard extended ACLs.

So the original answer correctly identifies that options d (URL) and e (TOS byte) cannot be compared using an extended IP ACL.

d. access-list 1 deny 186.33.0.0",a,a,a,"The correct answer is 'a'. To permit packets from a specific IP address in a standard ACL, you use the 'permit' keyword followed by the IP address. In this case, the ACL command should be 'access-list 1 permit 186.33.2.3' to match the given criteria of permitting packets from 186.33.2.3.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. To permit packets from a specific IP address in a standard ACL, the correct syntax is ""access-list [ACL number] permit [IP address]"". In this case, the ACL number is 1, and the IP address to permit is 186.33.2.3. Therefore, the correct ACL command is ""access-list 1 permit 186.33.2.3"", which matches option 'a'.

The ACL command 'access-list 1 permit 56.57.2.0 0.0.0.255' will indeed permit packets from hosts with IP addresses starting with 56.57.2, as required by the criteria. The wildcard mask 0.0.0.255 correctly matches any value in the last octet, allowing all hosts in the 56.57.2.0/24 subnet.

Let's briefly evaluate the other options:
b. Incorrect network address (57.57.2.0 instead of 56.57.2.0)
c. Incorrect wildcard mask (0.0.255.255 would match any value in the last two octets)
d. Incorrect action (deny instead of permit)

The ACL command 'access-list 101 permit tcp host 65.5.5.5 65.5.6.0 0.0.0.255 eq www' matches the given criteria. It permits TCP traffic from the specific host 65.5.5.5 to any host in the 65.5.6.0/24 subnet, but only if the destination port is www (HTTP). This aligns with the requirement to permit packets from web client 65.5.5.5 to a web server in the specified subnet.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The ACL command 'access-list 101 permit tcp host 65.5.5.5 65.5.6.0 0.0.0.255 eq www' accurately matches the given criteria:

1. It uses the specified ACL number 101.
2. It permits packets specifically from the web client with IP 65.5.5.5.
3. The destination is correctly specified as the subnet 65.5.6.0/24 using the wildcard mask 0.0.0.255.
4. It specifies the destination port as 'www' (HTTP), ensuring the packets are sent to a web server.

The other options are incorrect:
- Option a uses port 23 (Telnet) instead of 'www' (HTTP).

- Option 'c' incorrectly uses 'host 30.0.0.0' for the source IP instead of 'host 30.3.3.3'

Therefore, the provided answer of 'd' as the correct choice is accurate.

d. 255.255.255.255",a,a,a,"The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask. Given the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, the wildcard mask would be 0.0.0.255. This wildcard mask will match all IP addresses in the 46.45.44.0/24 subnet.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The wildcard mask is indeed the inverse (bitwise NOT) of the subnet mask. Since the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, the wildcard mask would be 0.0.0.255. This wildcard mask will match all IP addresses in the 46.45.44.0/24 subnet, as the last octet can be any value from 0 to 255.
