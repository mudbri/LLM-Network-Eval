72,A baud rate is a measurement of the number of ______________________.,"a. bits that can be sent across a telephone line every minute
b. bytes that can be sent across a telephone line every second
c. bits that can be sent across a telephone line every second
d. bytes that can be sent across a telephone line every minute
",c,c,c,"Baud rate is a measure of the number of signal or symbol changes that occur per second. In digital systems, a symbol change typically corresponds to a bit (binary digit). Therefore, baud rate measures the number of bits that can be transmitted per second over a communication channel like a telephone line.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. Baud rate is indeed a measure of the number of bits that can be sent across a communication channel, such as a telephone line, every second. The answer correctly identifies that baud rate is related to the number of signal or symbol changes per second, and in digital systems, each symbol typically represents one bit.

The modem modulates the digital data into these audible tones for transmission and demodulates the tones back into digital data on the receiving end.,"Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is incorrect. While modems do convert digital data into a form that can be transmitted over telephone lines, they do not convert it into ""audible wavelengths"". Modems convert digital data into analog signals using modulation techniques, but these analog signals are electrical signals, not audible sound waves.

Correct Answer: c. Modems convert digital data from computers into modulated electrical signals that can be transmitted over plain old telephone service (POTS) lines. The modem modulates the digital data by varying the amplitude, frequency, or phase of an electrical carrier signal to represent the binary data. On the receiving end, the modem demodulates the analog signal back into digital data that the computer can understand.",1,0,5_connecting_to_the_internet,0.0

78,Select all statements that are true of cable internet connections.,"a. They're wireless connections
b. They're broadband connections
c. They're dial-up connections
d. They're shared bandwidth connections
","b,d","b,d","b,d","Cable internet connections are broadband connections that provide high-speed internet access using the same coaxial cables that deliver cable television. They are not wireless or dial-up connections. Cable internet is a shared bandwidth connection, meaning that the available bandwidth is shared among multiple users in a neighborhood or area, which can lead to slower speeds during peak usage times.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. Cable internet connections are indeed broadband connections that provide high-speed internet access over coaxial cables, the same type used for cable television delivery. They are shared bandwidth connections, meaning that the available bandwidth is divided among multiple users in a given area, potentially leading to slower speeds during peak usage periods. The answer correctly identifies that cable internet is neither wireless nor dial-up.

b. LCP
c. Compression
d. NCP
","b,d","b,d","b,d","The two main subprotocols of PPP are:b. LCP (Link Control Protocol) - establishes, configures, and tests the data-link connection.  d. NCP (Network Control Protocol) - configures different network-layer protocols, like IPCP for IP.FCS (Frame Check Sequence) is a field in the PPP frame for error checking, not a subprotocol. Compression can be negotiated by LCP but is not itself a subprotocol.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation. It correctly identifies that the two main subprotocols of PPP are LCP (Link Control Protocol) and NCP (Network Control Protocol). The answer also explains the role of each subprotocol - LCP establishes, configures, and tests the data-link connection, while NCP configures different network-layer protocols like IPCP for IP.

The answer correctly points out that FCS (Frame Check Sequence) is a field in the PPP frame used for error checking, not a subprotocol itself. It also notes that while compression can be negotiated by LCP, it is not a separate subprotocol.

",c,c,c,"An Internet Service Provider (ISP) is responsible for handling the sending of data from one site to another over the Internet. ISPs own and maintain the infrastructure, such as routers, switches, and cabling, that enables data transmission between different networks and sites.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. An Internet Service Provider (ISP) is indeed responsible for handling the sending of data from one site to another over the Internet. ISPs own and operate the necessary infrastructure, such as routers, switches, and cabling, that enables data transmission between different networks and sites. They provide the connectivity and services required for data to be sent from one location to another across the Internet.

The other options are not directly responsible for sending data from one site to another:
a. T-carrier line: This is a type of digital transmission system used in telecommunications, but it is not an entity that handles data transmission itself.
b. CTO: A Chief Technology Officer (CTO) is an executive-level position within a company, responsible for overseeing the company's technological needs and strategies. They do not directly handle data transmission between sites.
d. VPN: A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a secure, encrypted connection between two networks over the Internet. While VPNs can be used to securely send data between sites, they are not the primary entities responsible for handling data transmission across the Internet.

The DA specifies the MAC address of the station the frame is destined for. The SA indicates the MAC address of the station the frame originated from. The BSSID identifies the access point that the client is currently associated with in infrastructure mode, or a randomly generated ID for ad-hoc mode.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is incorrect. While it correctly states that the 802.11 header contains the Destination Address (DA), Source Address (SA), and BSSID fields, it fails to mention the fourth address field that is present in certain frame types.

Correct Answer: b. The 802.11 header can contain up to 4 address fields, depending on the frame type and the mode of operation (infrastructure or ad-hoc). The four possible address fields are:

1. Receiver Address (RA): The MAC address of the receiving station.
2. Transmitter Address (TA): The MAC address of the transmitting station.
3. Destination Address (DA): The MAC address of the final destination station.
4. Source Address (SA): The MAC address of the original source station.

In infrastructure mode, the BSSID is typically the MAC address of the access point. The presence and order of these address fields depend on the specific frame type (data, management, or control) and the communication direction (to or from the access point).",0,0,5_connecting_to_the_internet,0.0
