32,What are some of the reasons that it is difficult to deploy improvements to BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. Changes are necessarily incremental because of the large installed base of routers that already run BGP.
b. BGP is implemented in hardware, so deploying changes to BGP requires changes on the timescale of hardware development cycles.
c. Deplyoing changes to BGP requires coordination across potentially tens of thousands of ASes in the Internet.
d. Only a few vendors implement BGP, and deploying changes requires convincing those vendors to change the protocol.
e. Deploying changes requires coordination in standards bodies such as the IETF.
","a,c,e","a,c,e","a,c,e","Deploying improvements to BGP is difficult for several reasons:a) BGP has a large installed base of routers, so changes need to be incremental to maintain compatibility. c) BGP is used across many autonomous systems (ASes) on the Internet, so deploying changes requires coordination among potentially thousands of network operators.e) As an Internet standard protocol, changes to BGP need to go through the IETF standardization process which involves coordination and consensus building.The other options are incorrect:b) BGP is typically implemented in software, not hardware. d) While a few major vendors dominate the router market, many vendors implement BGP.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation for each selected option. It correctly identifies that a, c, and e are the reasons why it is difficult to deploy improvements to BGP:

a) The large installed base of BGP routers means changes need to be incremental to maintain compatibility.
c) BGP is used across many autonomous systems, requiring coordination among numerous network operators to deploy changes.
e) As an Internet standard protocol, BGP changes must go through the IETF standardization process.

The answer also correctly explains why options b and d are not applicable. BGP is typically a software implementation, not hardware (eliminating b). And while the router market is dominated by a few major vendors, BGP is still implemented by many vendors (eliminating d).

In summary, this is a thorough and accurate answer to the question. No changes are needed.

In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, a single AS can benefit from deploying RCP even if no other ASes deploy RCP.","c,e","a,c,e","a,c,e","In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, the RCP controller for an AS sees all routes for all destinations that the AS learns from neighboring ASes (a). The routers in the AS no longer have to compute routes, as this is handled by the RCP controller (c). A single AS can benefit from deploying RCP in Phase 1 even if no other ASes deploy RCP, as it improves routing within the AS (e). However, in Phase 1, ASes still need to use BGP to exchange routes with each other (b is incorrect). The RCP controller does not operate like a route reflector, as it computes and distributes routes to all routers rather than just reflecting routes (d is incorrect).","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation for each selected option. It correctly identifies that options a, c, and e are true statements about RCP (Routing Control Platform), while options b and d are false.

34,"Which of the following are true about network management with BGP, in the absence of RCP? Select all that apply.","a. BGP's interaction with the underlying routing IGP routing protocol can result in persistent forwarding loops.
b. Implementing network-wide policy sometimes causes the routers themeselves to have to carry state.
c. Each router operates and makes decisions based only on a local view of network state.

e. It is not possible to perform traffic engineering with conventional BGP.
","a,b,c","b,c","b,c","In the absence of RCP, network management with BGP has the following characteristics:b) Implementing network-wide policy sometimes requires the routers themselves to maintain state in order to enforce the policy across the network.  c) With BGP, each router operates based on its own local view of the network state, without a centralized global view. It makes routing decisions independently using the information exchanged with its peers.Choices a, d, and e are incorrect:a) While suboptimal routing can occur due to interaction between BGP and the IGP, persistent forwarding loops are unlikely as BGP has loop prevention mechanisms.d) BGP is distributed, so there is no single point of failure. If one BGP router fails, others can still exchange routing information.e) Traffic engineering is possible with BGP by using techniques like AS path prepending, MED, or communities to influence path selection.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation for the selected choices (b and c) as well as the reasons for excluding the other options. It correctly identifies that in the absence of RCP, BGP routers may need to maintain state to enforce network-wide policies and that each router makes decisions based on its local view of the network state exchanged with peers. The answer also properly refutes the incorrect choices, explaining that persistent forwarding loops are unlikely due to BGP's loop prevention, BGP is distributed without a single point of failure, and traffic engineering is possible using various BGP path selection techniques.

35,Which of the following is true about the second phase of RCP deployment? Select all that apply.,"a. The second phase of RCP deployment requires no coordination with neighboring ASes.
b. The second phase of RCP deployment offers potential benefits such as reduced routing table size.
c. In the second phase of deployment, the RCP controller sees all routes for every destination that neighboring ASes advertise.

While options b, c, d, and e are all correct statements about the second phase of RCP deployment, option a is incorrectly included. The second phase still requires coordination with neighboring ASes to receive their route advertisements at the RCP controller. The RCP controller needs to establish BGP sessions with border routers of neighboring ASes to learn the routes they are advertising. Without this, the RCP controller would not have visibility into the available routes to make selections on behalf of the AS. So option a should not be selected.

36,"In terms of the parlance of the 4D architecture, which protocol serves as the ""dissemination plane"" for the RCP?","a. External BGP
b. Spanning Tree Protocol
c. The Internal Gateway Protocol (IGP)
d. Internal BGP
e. LLDP
",d,d,d,"In the 4D architecture for Software Defined Networking, the Internal BGP (iBGP) protocol serves as the dissemination plane for the Routing Control Platform (RCP). The RCP uses iBGP to distribute routing information to the forwarding elements in the network. iBGP allows the RCP to communicate routing decisions to the individual routers.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. In the 4D architecture, the Internal BGP (iBGP) protocol is used as the dissemination plane for the Routing Control Platform (RCP). The RCP makes routing decisions and uses iBGP to distribute these decisions to the forwarding elements (routers) in the network. iBGP allows the RCP to communicate and enforce its routing policies on the individual routers.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:
a. External BGP (eBGP) is used for exchanging routing information between different autonomous systems (AS), not within the same AS.
b. Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is used for preventing loops in switched Ethernet networks, not for disseminating routing information.
c. The Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) like OSPF and IS-IS are used for exchanging routing information within an AS, but they don't serve as the dissemination plane for the RCP in the 4D architecture.
e. Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) is used for discovering and exchanging information about directly connected neighbors, not for disseminating routing information from the RCP.

b. Discovery plane
c. Decision plane
d. Data plane
e. Dissemination plane
",c,c,c,"In the 4D architecture for Software Defined Networking, the Decision plane is responsible for path selection and traffic engineering. The Decision plane makes decisions about how traffic should flow through the network based on policies and the network topology learned from the Discovery plane.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. In the 4D architecture for Software Defined Networking (SDN), the Decision plane is indeed responsible for path selection and traffic engineering. The Decision plane uses information about the network topology and state gathered by the Discovery plane to make informed decisions on how to route traffic through the network based on defined policies and optimization goals.

The other planes in the 4D architecture have the following roles:
- Discovery plane: Responsible for discovering the network topology and device capabilities.
- Dissemination plane: Responsible for communicating the decisions made by the Decision plane to the Data plane devices. 
- Data plane: Responsible for forwarding packets based on the rules installed by the Decision plane.

So the Decision plane is the key control point that determines the optimal paths and implements traffic engineering in an SDN network using the 4D architecture.
