72,"In NFV, which of the following is the function of steering?","a. Finding the best location to place a single network function in an enterprise or wide area network.
b. Installing custom packet processing code on servers in the network.
c. Placing middleboxes at places throughout the network to minimize network load.
d. Installing custom packet processing code on switches in the network.
e. Installing flow table entries in switches to forward traffic through network functions or middleboxes that are installed in the network
",e,e,e,"In NFV (Network Function Virtualization), steering refers to the process of directing network traffic through the appropriate sequence of virtual network functions (VNFs) or middleboxes to achieve the desired network services. This is typically done by installing flow table entries in switches that forward the traffic according to predefined policies or service function chains. The flow table entries ensure that the traffic traverses the necessary network functions in the correct order before reaching its destination.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer and explanation are correct. In NFV, steering involves installing flow table entries in switches to direct network traffic through the appropriate sequence of virtual network functions (VNFs) or middleboxes. This ensures that the traffic undergoes the necessary processing and traverses the required network functions before reaching its destination.

74,What are some advantages of Docker containers over virtual machines? Select all that apply.,"a. Containers can be connected to build a virtual network, whereas virtual machines cannot.
b. Performance in containers may be better since they invoke OS system calls directly, rather than through an emulated machine.
c. Containers require less storage and memory per-instance, and require less time to instantiate than virtual machines.
d. Containers provide more flexibility in the choice of operating system.
e. Containers provide better isolation than virtual machines.
","b,c","b,c","b,c","Containers can provide better performance than virtual machines since they invoke OS system calls directly rather than going through an emulated machine (b). Containers also generally require less storage, memory, and startup time compared to virtual machines since they share the host OS kernel and don't need to boot up a full OS (c). While containers can be networked (a), virtual machines can be as well. Containers are more limited in OS choice since they share the host kernel (d). And virtual machines actually provide stronger isolation than containers (e).","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation for each selected and unselected option. It correctly identifies that containers can provide better performance by directly invoking OS system calls (b) and require less resources and startup time by sharing the host OS kernel (c). It also accurately points out that both containers and VMs can be networked, contrary to (a). The answer explains that containers have more limited OS options due to sharing the host kernel (d) and that VMs provide stronger isolation than containers (e). The reasoning is sound and the answer is complete.

75,Which of the following commands is used to instantiate a new Docker container by invoking a command in that container?,"a. docker stop
b. docker attach
c. docker commit
d. docker pull
e. docker run
",e,e,e,The 'docker run' command is used to create and start a new container. It can be used to invoke a command inside the newly created container. The other options are used for different purposes: - 'docker stop' is used to stop a running container - 'docker attach' is used to attach to a running container - 'docker commit' is used to create a new image from a container's changes   - 'docker pull' is used to pull an image from a registry,"Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation. It correctly identifies that the 'docker run' command is used to create and start a new container, and that it can be used to invoke a command inside the newly created container. The answer also provides brief but accurate descriptions of what the other command options do, helping to clarify why they are not the correct choices for the given question.

76,Which of the following is true about networking Docker containers? Select all that apply.,"a. Docker containers can be networked to each other via the native Docker bridge or Open vSwitch.
b. A Docker container can never expose a low port (e.g., port 80) to the external Internet; Internet hosts must always reach a Docker service by a high port (e.g., 8080).
c. Docker containers running in different virtual machines cannot be networked together.
d. Connecting Docker containers requires setting up GRE tunnels between the containers.
e. Docker containers are not reachable from the external Internet by default.
","a,e","a,e","a,e","Docker containers can be networked to each other using the native Docker bridge or Open vSwitch (a). By default, Docker containers are not reachable from the external Internet for security reasons (e). However, Docker containers can be configured to expose any port, including low ports like 80, to the external Internet (b is incorrect). Docker containers running in different VMs can be networked together (c is incorrect). Connecting Docker containers does not require setting up GRE tunnels (d is incorrect).","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation for each choice. It correctly identifies that options a and e are true statements about networking Docker containers. The answer also explains why the other options (b, c, and d) are incorrect. The reasoning provided is clear and accurate.
