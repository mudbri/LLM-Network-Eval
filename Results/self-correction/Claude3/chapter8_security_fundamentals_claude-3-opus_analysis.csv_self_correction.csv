137,"In a spoofing attack, which of the following parameters are commonly spoofed? (Choose two answers)","a. Source IP address
b. MAC address
c. ARP address
d. Routing table
e. Destination IP address
f. ARP table
","a,b","a,b","a,b","In a spoofing attack, the two most commonly spoofed parameters are:a. Source IP address: Attackers can forge the source IP address in the packet header to make it appear as if the packets are coming from a trusted or legitimate source. This is known as IP spoofing.b. MAC address: Attackers can change the MAC address of their device to impersonate another device on the network. This is called MAC spoofing.The other choices, such as ARP address, routing table, destination IP address, and ARP table, are not typically spoofed in a spoofing attack.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a clear explanation of why the selected options are the most commonly spoofed parameters in a spoofing attack. The answer correctly identifies that attackers can forge the source IP address to make packets appear to come from a trusted source (IP spoofing) and change the MAC address to impersonate another device (MAC spoofing). It also correctly points out that the other choices are not typically spoofed in such attacks.

b. ARP
c. RADIUS
d. HTTP
",c,c,c,"RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) is the other protocol commonly supported by AAA servers alongside TACACS+ for communicating with enterprise resources. RADIUS is an IETF standard protocol used for secure authentication, authorization, and accounting.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) servers typically support both TACACS+ and RADIUS protocols for communicating with enterprise resources to handle user authentication, authorization of access, and accounting of user activities.

- TACACS+ is a Cisco proprietary protocol that separates authentication, authorization, and accounting.
- RADIUS is an IETF standard protocol that combines authentication and authorization into a single step, with accounting being handled separately.

The other options are incorrect:
- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is used for automatically assigning IP addresses to devices.
- ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used for mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses.
- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is used for transferring web pages and other content over the internet.

Therefore, RADIUS is the correct answer to complement TACACS+ as the protocols commonly supported by AAA servers.

152,A next-generation firewall sits at the edge of a company’s connection to the Internet. A network engineer has been configured to prevent Telnet clients residing on the Internet from accessing Telnet servers inside the company. Which of the following might a next-generation firewall use that a traditional firewall would not?,"a. Match message destination well-known port 23
b. Match message application data
c. Match message IP protocol 23
d. Match message source TCP ports lower than 5400",b,b,b,"A next-generation firewall can inspect the application layer data to identify the specific application, in this case Telnet, regardless of the port being used. Traditional firewalls typically only match on IP addresses, protocol numbers, and port numbers. They cannot look into the application data to determine the actual application. So while a traditional firewall could block port 23 (the well-known port for Telnet), a next-gen firewall can identify and block Telnet traffic on any port by analyzing the application data itself.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation. A key distinguishing feature of next-generation firewalls compared to traditional firewalls is their ability to inspect application layer data to identify specific applications, regardless of the ports being used. This allows them to enforce policies based on applications rather than just IP addresses, protocols, and port numbers.

The answer correctly points out that while a traditional firewall could block the standard Telnet port 23, a client could potentially use a non-standard port to bypass this. However, a next-generation firewall can recognize Telnet traffic based on analyzing the application data itself, even if a non-standard port is used.

The other options related to matching the destination port 23, protocol number 23, or source ports would be techniques a traditional firewall could use, but would not be as effective as the next-generation capability of application data inspection.
