1,Which of the following are true about Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)? Select all that apply.,"a. The only sizes for an IP address allocation before CIDR were 8, 16, or 24 bits.
b. The prefix length for a CIDR prefix can be anywhere in the range from 0 to 32 bits.
c. In an Internet forwarding table with CIDR, there can only be one unique matching entry for any given IP address.
d. CIDR slowed the rate of Internet routing table growth because prefixes no longer had to be allocated in fixed-size blocks.","b,d","b,d","b.TheprefixlengthforaCIDRprefixcanindeedrangefrom0to32bits,allowingforvariable-lengthsubnetmasks.

This enables more efficient allocation of IP address blocks compared to the fixed sizes of 8, 16, or 24 bits used in classful addressing. By allowing prefixes to be allocated in variable-sized blocks, CIDR helped slow the growth of Internet routing tables. However, with CIDR, there can be multiple matching entries in the forwarding table for a given IP address, with the longest prefix match being used.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is mostly correct but contains one mistake. It correctly identifies options b and d as true statements about CIDR. However, the explanation incorrectly states that with CIDR, there can be multiple matching entries in the forwarding table for a given IP address. In fact, one of the key features of CIDR is that it ensures there is only one unique matching entry for any IP address in the forwarding table.

Correct Answer: b, d. The original answer correctly selected options b and d, as they are both true statements about CIDR:

b. The prefix length for a CIDR prefix can indeed range from 0 to 32 bits, allowing for variable-length subnet masks.

d. CIDR did help slow the growth of Internet routing tables by allowing prefixes to be allocated in variable-sized blocks, rather than the fixed-size blocks used in classful addressing.

However, option c is also correct. In a CIDR-based forwarding table, the longest prefix match algorithm ensures that there is only one unique matching entry for any given IP address. The original answer's explanation incorrectly stated that there can be multiple matching entries.

Option a is incorrect, as the sizes for IP address allocation before CIDR were not limited to only 8, 16, or 24 bits. Classful addressing also allowed for allocations of size 0 bits (default route) and 32 bits (/32 host route).",1,0,1_SDN_Basics,0.0
2,Which of the following are true about how DNS lookups work? Select all that apply.,"a. A DNS A-record query for google.com will only return a single IP address at a time.
b. An NS-record query for a DNS lookup will return the name(s) of the authoritative name server(s) for that domain.
c. If your local DNS resolver caches an NS record for google.com for multiple days, all clients who use that DNS resolver will continue using the same IP address to reach Google’s Web server until that NS record expires.
d. An MX-record query for a DNS lookup will return the IP address of the mail server for that domain.
e. All DNS PTR records are maintained by a single organization in-addr.arpa.
",b,b,b,"An NS (Name Server) record query returns the authoritative name server(s) for the specified domain. The other options are incorrect: a) An A record can return multiple IP addresses, not just one at a time.   c) NS records map domain names to authoritative name servers, not IP addresses of web servers. Even if an NS record is cached, the IP address can change. d) MX records contain the domain name of the mail server, not the IP address. e) PTR records map IP addresses to domain names and are maintained by the owner of the IP address block, not a single central organization.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct in selecting option b as a true statement about how DNS lookups work. The explanations for why the other options are incorrect are also accurate and well-explained.

3,Which of the following are true about traffic control with BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
b. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
c. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
d. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.

The local preference is used to prefer certain paths out of the AS over others. BGP AS path prepending can also be used to control outbound traffic by making certain paths appear longer and less preferred. However, AS path prepending is typically used to influence inbound traffic from other ASes by making paths through the operator's AS look less attractive. The local preference attribute has no impact on inbound traffic from other ASes.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is partially correct. It correctly identifies that the BGP local preference attribute can be used to control outbound traffic from an AS to a destination (choice a). However, it incorrectly states that AS path prepending can be used to control outbound traffic (choice c). AS path prepending is actually used to influence inbound traffic from other ASes.

Correct Answer: a. The BGP local preference attribute is used by a network operator to control outbound traffic from their AS to a destination. It allows the operator to prefer certain exit points from their AS over others for specific destinations. On the other hand, AS path prepending is used to make paths advertised by an AS look less attractive to influence inbound traffic from other ASes. By artificially increasing the AS path length, an operator can make certain paths less preferred by other ASes, discouraging them from sending traffic through those paths. Therefore, only choice ""a"" is correct, while ""c"" is incorrect. Choices ""b"" and ""d"" are also correct statements about traffic control with BGP but were not selected in the original answer.",0,0,1_SDN_Basics,0.0
4,Which of the following are true about layering? Select all that apply.,"a. The network layer guarantees reliable, in-order delivery of packets.
b. The network layer has only a single protocol in widespread use today, representing what we call the “narrow waist”.
c. The transport layer uses port numbers.
d. The destination address in the link layer header is always the address of the next layer-3 node along an end-to-end IP path.","b,c","b,c","b,c","The network layer has a single widely used protocol - IP - which represents the 'narrow waist' of the protocol stack (b). The transport layer uses port numbers to multiplex/demultiplex data to/from applications (c). The network layer does not guarantee reliable, in-order delivery (a) - that is the job of TCP at the transport layer if needed. The link layer destination address is the address of the next hop node, which may or may not be a layer-3 node (d).","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation for each choice. It correctly identifies that options b and c are true statements about layering in computer networks. The answer also explains why options a and d are false. The network layer (IP) does not guarantee reliable, in-order delivery, as that is the responsibility of the transport layer protocol TCP if needed. The link layer destination address is the address of the next hop node, which may or may not be a layer-3 node, so option d is incorrect.

5,Which of the following are not true about packet switching? Select all that apply.,"a. Once a connection is established between two endpoints in a packet switched network, the end-to-end route cannot change, or the connection must be re-established.
b. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will always experience predictable latency.
c. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will never be dropped by intermediate nodes along the path.
d. A user of a packet switched network might occasionally get a “busy signal” if there are too many users on the network.
","a,b,c,d","a,b,c,d","a,b,c,d","All of the given choices are incorrect about packet switching:a) In a packet switched network, packets can take different routes between endpoints and the connection does not need to be re-established if the route changes.  b) Latency in a packet switched network is variable and unpredictable as it depends on factors like network congestion.c) Packets can be dropped by intermediate nodes in a packet switched network if buffers are full or errors occur.d) Users do not get a ""busy signal"" in a packet switched network. If the network is congested, packets may be delayed or dropped but users are not blocked from accessing the network.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer correctly identifies that all of the given choices are not true about packet switching. The explanations provided for each choice are accurate and clearly explain why the statements are incorrect.

a) It's true that in a packet-switched network, packets can take different routes between endpoints and the connection does not need to be re-established if the route changes. The original answer correctly points this out.

b) The original answer is correct in stating that latency in a packet-switched network is variable and unpredictable as it depends on factors like network congestion. Latency is not guaranteed to be predictable.

c) Packets can indeed be dropped by intermediate nodes in a packet-switched network if buffers are full or errors occur, as the original answer explains. There is no guarantee that packets will never be dropped.

d) The original answer correctly notes that users do not get a ""busy signal"" in a packet-switched network. Congestion may lead to delays or dropped packets, but users are not blocked from network access.

In summary, the original answer provides a thorough and accurate evaluation of why all the given choices are incorrect statements about packet switching.

6,Which of the following are true about content distribution networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Content distribution networks can improve the performance that a client sees by reducing the network latency between the client and the content that it is downloading.
b. Content distribution networks can reduce transit expenses for a content provider by enabling much of the provider’s content to be served from a nearby network, sometimes even from a cache that is within the client’s own network.
c. Real-time content such as video streams cannot be distributed from a content distribution network.
d. Content distribution networks typically redirect Web clients to a nearby Web cache by rewriting the IP address of packets sent from the client to the IP address of the nearby Web cache.
","a,b","a,b","a,b","Content distribution networks (CDNs) can improve client performance by reducing network latency, as the content is served from a nearby cache server rather than the origin server which may be geographically distant (a). CDNs can also reduce transit costs for the content provider, as much of the content is served from edge cache servers, often within the client's own network, reducing the bandwidth usage and cost on the provider's network (b). However, CDNs are commonly used to distribute real-time content like video streams (c is incorrect). CDNs typically redirect clients to a nearby cache using DNS resolution or URL rewriting, not by modifying the IP address of packets (d is incorrect).","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. It correctly identifies that options a and b are true statements about content distribution networks (CDNs). The answer provides a clear explanation for why a and b are correct. It also explains why options c and d are incorrect - CDNs can distribute real-time content like video (contrary to c), and they use techniques like DNS resolution or URL rewriting to direct clients to nearby caches, not IP address rewriting (contrary to d). The answer shows a solid understanding of how CDNs work to improve performance and reduce costs.

7,Which of the following are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control? Select all that apply.,"a. Only wireless networks can have collisions at the receiver; such collisions are not possible on wired Ethernet networks.
b. Using RTS/CTS (“request to send”, “clear to send”) control reduces the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network.
c. A wireless sender can avoid causing a collision at the receiver by performing a “carrier sense” to determine whether any other sender wants to transmit at the time that it wishes to send a packet.
d. Disabling RTS/CTS necessarily lowers the effective throughput of the wireless network, since more collisions will occur at the receiver without RTS/CTS enabled.
",b,"b,c","b,c","Both options b and c are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control. Using RTS/CTS does reduce overall throughput because of the additional control overhead, but it helps avoid collisions caused by hidden terminals. Performing carrier sense allows a sender to avoid colliding with other transmissions it can detect. Option a is false because collisions can occur on wired Ethernet as well. Option d is false because disabling RTS/CTS can sometimes improve throughput if the overhead of the control frames outweighs the cost of additional collisions.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation for each option. It correctly identifies that both options b and c are true statements about 802.11 wireless medium access control. The answer explains that using RTS/CTS reduces overall throughput due to the additional control overhead, but helps avoid collisions from hidden terminals. It also notes that carrier sense allows senders to avoid colliding with other detectable transmissions. The explanations for why options a and d are false are clear and accurate as well.

8,Which of the following are true about video streaming? Select all that apply.,"a. Using UDP to stream a video instead of TCP is appropriate if the client is more concerned about low delay and interactivity than it does about receiving a high-quality stream.
b. A larger playout buffer at the client allows the client more time to recover from lost packets.
c. Using TCP for video streaming could result in larger delays between transmission and playout than streaming the same video with UDP.
d. Since UDP provides no reliable delivery guarantees, a video streaming application that uses UDP as its transport cannot recover from any packet loss in the video stream.
","a,b,c","a,b,c","a,b,c","Using UDP for video streaming is appropriate when low delay and interactivity are more important than receiving a high-quality stream (a). A larger playout buffer at the client provides more time to recover from lost packets by allowing retransmissions or error correction (b). TCP's reliable delivery mechanism and congestion control can introduce larger delays compared to UDP (c). However, (d) is incorrect because even with UDP, a video streaming application can employ techniques like error correction, retransmission requests, or adaptive bitrate to recover from packet loss.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation for each selected option. It correctly identifies that options a, b, and c are true statements about video streaming, while option d is false. The answer explains why using UDP can be appropriate for low-delay and interactive video streaming, how a larger playout buffer helps recover from lost packets, and why TCP can introduce larger delays compared to UDP. It also points out that even with UDP, video streaming applications can employ techniques to recover from packet loss, contradicting the incorrect statement in option d.

9,Which of the following are true about TCP? Select all that apply.,"a. TCP guarantees that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted.
b. A TCP sender and receiver use a “three-way handshake” both to set up and to terminate the TCP connection.
c. TCP’s congestion avoidance algorithm causes the sender to reduce its sending rate by a factor of two when it sees a packet loss.
d. A TCP sender controls its sending rate by adjusting the number of unacknowledged packets that can be sent over the network at any time.
","a,c,d","a,d","a,d","Options a and d are correct about TCP. TCP does guarantee that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted, providing reliable data transfer (a). TCP also uses a congestion window to control the number of unacknowledged packets that can be in transit, adjusting the sending rate (d). However, TCP uses a three-way handshake only to establish the connection, not to terminate it (b is incorrect). And while TCP does react to packet loss, it does not always reduce the sending rate by a factor of two - that depends on the specific congestion control algorithm being used (c is incorrect).","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation for why options a and d are true about TCP, while options b and c are false. It correctly identifies that TCP guarantees in-order, reliable data transfer (a) and uses a congestion window to control the sending rate (d). The answer also accurately points out that the three-way handshake is only used for connection establishment, not termination (b is incorrect), and that the specific rate reduction factor depends on the congestion control algorithm, not always being a factor of two (c is incorrect).

10,Which of the following are true about denial of service attacks (and defenses)? Select all that apply.,"a. If every network on the Internet performed stateless ingress filtering to defend against source IP spoofing, the DNS reflection attack would not work.
b. If every network on the Internet performed stateless egress filtering to defend against source IP address spoofing, the DNS reflection attack could not be carried out.
c. In a “SYN Flood” attack, each TCP SYN packet that a victim receives causes it to set up TCP connection state.
d. A “DNS Reflection” attack requires the attacking client to “spoof” the source IP address of the packet containing the DNS request.
","b,c,d","b,c,d","b,c,d","Options b, c, and d are all correct statements about denial of service attacks and defenses:b) If all networks implemented egress filtering to prevent source IP spoofing, attackers would not be able to spoof the victim's IP as the source of DNS requests in a reflection attack.c) In a SYN flood, each received SYN causes the victim to allocate resources for a half-open TCP connection, potentially exhausting resources. d) DNS reflection attacks rely on the attacker spoofing the victim's IP as the source of many DNS requests, so the DNS servers' replies overwhelm the victim.Option a is incorrect because ingress filtering at the destination cannot prevent the victim from receiving the reflected DNS replies in a reflection attack.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer and explanation are correct. Options b, c, and d are all accurate statements about denial of service attacks and defenses:

b) Egress filtering prevents source IP address spoofing, which is necessary for carrying out DNS reflection attacks. If all networks implemented this, the attack would be prevented.

c) In a SYN flood attack, each received SYN packet causes the victim to allocate resources and state for a half-open TCP connection. Accumulating many of these can exhaust the victim's resources.

d) DNS reflection attacks work by the attacker spoofing the victim's IP address as the source of many DNS requests. This causes DNS servers to send their replies to the victim, overwhelming it.

The explanation correctly identifies that option a is incorrect, as ingress filtering at the destination network cannot stop the victim from receiving the reflected DNS replies that constitute the attack traffic.
