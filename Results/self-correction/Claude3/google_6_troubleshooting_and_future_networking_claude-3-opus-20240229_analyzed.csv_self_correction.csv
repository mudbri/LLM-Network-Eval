93,Traceroute uses UDP packets on which of the following operating systems? Select all that apply.,"a. Mac Os
b. Windows 10
c. Windows 7
d. Linux","a,d","a,d","a,d","Traceroute uses UDP packets by default on Mac OS and Linux operating systems. On Windows operating systems including Windows 7 and Windows 10, traceroute uses ICMP echo request packets instead of UDP packets.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. Traceroute does indeed use UDP packets by default on Mac OS and Linux operating systems, while it uses ICMP echo request packets on Windows operating systems like Windows 7 and Windows 10.

The key points are:
1. On Mac OS and Linux, the traceroute utility sends UDP packets to high port numbers of each hop and waits for ICMP ""port unreachable"" messages to determine RTT.
2. On Windows, the tracert utility uses ICMP echo request packets instead of UDP. It measures the RTT based on the ICMP echo reply packets it receives back.

So the answer correctly identifies the operating systems where traceroute uses UDP by default (Mac OS and Linux) and where it uses ICMP instead (Windows 7 and 10).

94,"During a traceroute, which action does a router perform to the value in the Time To Live (TTL) field?","a. Multiplication
b. Division
c. Subtraction
d. Addition
",c,c,c,"During a traceroute, each router that receives the packet subtracts one from the Time To Live (TTL) value before forwarding the packet to the next hop. When a router receives a packet with a TTL value of 1, it discards the packet and sends an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the source, indicating that the packet's TTL has expired. This process allows traceroute to map the route and measure transit delays of packets across an IP network.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a clear and accurate explanation of how routers handle the Time To Live (TTL) field during a traceroute. The answer correctly states that each router subtracts one from the TTL value before forwarding the packet. It also explains what happens when the TTL reaches 1, with the router discarding the packet and sending an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the source.
