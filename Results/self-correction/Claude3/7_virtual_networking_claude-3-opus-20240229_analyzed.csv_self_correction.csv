The explanation provided for each selected option is accurate and relevant. However, the answer fails to explain why option ""b"" (longest-prefix match forwarding on an IP router) is not a method for creating virtual links.

Correct Answer: a, c, d, e. The selected options are correct because:
a. MPLS tunnels can be used to encapsulate IP packets, enabling virtual links across a wide area network.
c. Encapsulating Ethernet packets sent between VMs inside IP packets allows for wide-area tunneling.
d. VLAN switching based on tags creates isolated virtual links on a shared physical network.
e. Pairing virtual Ethernet interfaces between the virtual environment and host namespace establishes virtual links.

56,Which of the following are true of the Mininet network emulator? Select all that apply.,"a. It requires running OpenFlow-capable switches.
b. It is difficult to use it to route traffic for real services.
c. Mininet only allows users to create three types of topologies: linear, tree, and single-switch topologies.
d. It can create an emulation that runs across multiple physically distributed nodes.
e. All of the hosts in the topology must run the same underlying operating system.
","b,e","b,d","b,d,e.Optionsb,d,andeareallcorrectstatementsabouttheMininetnetworkemulator.","Mininet does not require running OpenFlow-capable switches, as it can emulate OpenFlow switches in software (a is incorrect). Mininet can be used to route traffic for real services, but it is not well-suited for this purpose due to performance limitations of the emulation environment (b is correct). Mininet allows users to create arbitrary network topologies, not just linear, tree, and single-switch (c is incorrect). Mininet can distribute the emulation across multiple physical machines to improve scalability (d is correct). The emulated hosts in Mininet share the same kernel, but can run different software (e is incorrect).","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is mostly correct but contains one error. While it correctly identifies that options b and d are true statements about Mininet, it incorrectly states that option e is incorrect. In fact, all hosts in a Mininet topology do run the same underlying operating system kernel, since they are emulated as processes on the same Linux machine.

Correct Answer: b, d, e. Options b, d, and e are all correct statements about the Mininet network emulator.",0,0,7_virtual_networking,0.0
57,"What are the benefits of emulation as opposed to, say, simulation? Select all that apply.","a. An emulation will complete faster than a simulation.
b. An emulator makes it possible to ""port"" experiments from one machine to another.
c. An emulator allows the experimenter run real software on each of the nodes in the emulation.
d. An emulation is easier to debug than a simulation.
e. Every run of the emulator will yield exactly the same results, resulting in reproducible experiments.
","b,c","b,c","b,c","Emulation has a couple key benefits over simulation. First, an emulator makes it possible to 'port' experiments from one machine to another (b), allowing for reproducibility and sharing of experimental setups. Second, and perhaps most importantly, an emulator allows the experimenter to run real software on each of the nodes in the emulation (c). This means the behavior will match what would happen on real hardware more closely than a simulation. The other options are not necessarily benefits of emulation - a simulation may run faster (a), be easier to debug (d), and be more deterministic (e) than an emulation.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation for why options b and c are benefits of emulation over simulation. The answer correctly identifies that emulation allows experiments to be ported between machines and enables running real software on emulated nodes. It also explains why the other options are not necessarily advantages of emulation compared to simulation.

However, Mininet runs as a single process on a single machine, so it cannot measure latency between geographically distant hosts (a). Also, while IP addresses can be assigned, Mininet does not include a DHCP server functionality to automatically assign them (c).","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation for each option. It correctly identifies that options b, d, and e are possible in Mininet, while options a and c are not. The answer explains that Mininet runs as a single process on a single machine, making it impossible to measure latency between geographically distant hosts. It also clarifies that while custom IP addresses can be assigned to nodes, Mininet does not include a built-in DHCP server for automatic IP assignment.

61,Select the statement that is most true about the relationship between network virtualization and SDNs.,"a. Network virtualization is a potential enabler for software-defined networks, since the separation of data and control planes first requires the creation of a logical network.
b. Software-defined networking is a potential enabler for virtual networks, since separation of data and control planes makes it easier to manage a logical network topology.
c. Network virtualization is a new concept introduced by Amazon, Nicira, and industry players; it only made sense to talk about network virtualization once central SDN controllers existed.
d. Network virtualization and software-defined networking each enable the other: SDN cannot exist without network virtualization, and network virtualization cannot exist without SDN.
",b,"a,b","a.ThisstatementcorrectlycapturesthatnetworkvirtualizationenableskeyaspectsofSDNs,butSDNsarenotanabsoluterequirementfornetworkvirtualization.","Both statements a and b are true about the relationship between network virtualization and SDNs. Network virtualization enables the creation of logical networks separate from the underlying physical infrastructure, which is a prerequisite for separating the data and control planes in SDNs. At the same time, the separation of data and control planes in SDNs makes it easier to manage and orchestrate virtual network topologies. So network virtualization and SDN are complementary technologies that enable each other, but one is not strictly dependent on the other.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is partially correct. Statement a is true - network virtualization is an enabler for SDNs by allowing the creation of logical networks separate from the physical infrastructure, which facilitates the separation of data and control planes. However, statement b is not entirely accurate. While SDNs can make it easier to manage virtual networks, network virtualization existed before SDNs and does not require SDNs to function. Virtual networks can be created and managed without a centralized SDN controller. Statements c and d are clearly false, as network virtualization preceded SDNs and the two are not co-dependent, even if they are complementary.

Correct Answer: a. This statement correctly captures that network virtualization enables key aspects of SDNs, but SDNs are not an absolute requirement for network virtualization.",0,0,7_virtual_networking,0.0
