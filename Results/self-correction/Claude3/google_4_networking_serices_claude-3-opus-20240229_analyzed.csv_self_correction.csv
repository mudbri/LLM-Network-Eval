46,What transport layer protocol does DNS normally use?,"a. TCP
b. IP
c. UDP
d. ICMP
",c,c,c,"DNS (Domain Name System) normally uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) as its transport layer protocol. UDP is a lightweight, connectionless protocol that is well-suited for the small, quick queries and responses typical of DNS lookups. DNS queries and responses are usually small enough to fit within a single UDP datagram. TCP is used by DNS only when the response data exceeds the maximum UDP packet size of 512 bytes, in which case the DNS client will retry over TCP.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation. It accurately states that DNS normally uses UDP as its transport layer protocol due to UDP's lightweight and connectionless nature, which is suitable for the small and quick queries and responses typical of DNS lookups.
