87,Which of the following reasons make programming OpenFlow switches difficult? Select all that apply.,"a. An OpenFlow controller only sees events for packets that the switches do not know how to handle.
b. OpenFlow networks require a single, centralized network controller.
c. Networks often have switches from multiple hardware vendors.
d. OpenFlow switches control switches at a low level of abstraction.
e. Network policies involve many independent tasks that may have conflicting behaviors.

Different vendors may have variations in their OpenFlow implementations which the controller needs to account for.  e) Network policies involve many independent tasks that may have conflicting behaviors. The controller needs to reconcile these conflicts and dependencies when programming flow rules across the switches.The other options are not correct:a) The controller sees all packets initially until it programs flow rules on the switches. b) While a centralized controller is common, distributed controllers are possible.d) OpenFlow provides a higher-level flow-based abstraction compared to programming individual switches.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer of ""c, e"" is partially correct but incomplete. It correctly identifies that having switches from multiple vendors (c) and the need to handle conflicting network policies (e) can make OpenFlow programming difficult. The justifications provided for these choices are valid.

However, the answer misses another important reason - that OpenFlow switches control switches at a low level of abstraction (d). Contrary to what the answer states, OpenFlow does not provide a high-level abstraction. It requires programming at the level of individual switch flow tables, which is lower-level than some other SDN abstractions.

The other two options (a and b) are indeed incorrect for the reasons stated in the original answer.

Correct Answer: c, d, e. Programming OpenFlow can be challenging because of the need to handle multi-vendor environments (c), the low-level flow table abstraction (d), and the potential for policy conflicts across multiple tasks (e).",0,0,12_programming_SDNs,0.0
89,"Suppose that a network operator wants to express a policy that drops all traffic except for traffic from a specific IP prefix (i.e., group of IP addresses).  What problems exist with expressing this policy as a set of OpenFlow rules? Select all that apply.","a. Switches have limited room for flow table entries and cannot store rules for all IP addresses in a prefix by default.
b. The controller may see more than the first packet for a flow that it has already installed.
c. If the controller installs the rules in the wrong order, all traffic might be dropped, instead of allowing the permitted traffic.
d. If the operator starts adding more IP addresses that are permitted to send traffic, performance of the switch might suffer as the number of entries in the switch table grows.
e. Flow table entries can only perform exact matches on IP addresses, so installing rules that operate on groups of IP addresses will take many flow-table entries in the switch.
","a,b,c,d","a,d,e","a,d,e","Expressing a policy to drop all traffic except from a specific IP prefix using OpenFlow rules has several issues. Switches have limited flow table space and cannot store rules for all individual IP addresses in a prefix by default (a). As more permitted IP addresses are added, the growing number of entries can degrade switch performance (d). Since flow table entries only support exact IP address matches, implementing rules for IP address groups would consume many flow table entries (e). The controller seeing packets for already installed flows (b) and incorrect rule ordering causing all traffic to be dropped (c) are not directly related to the specific policy described in the question.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a solid explanation for the selected options. It correctly identifies that options a, d, and e are the most relevant problems with expressing the given policy using OpenFlow rules. The answer explains how limited flow table space, performance degradation with a growing number of entries, and the need for exact IP address matching leading to many flow table entries are all valid concerns. It also correctly points out that options b and c, while potential issues in OpenFlow networks, do not directly relate to the specific policy scenario described in the question.

It involves first blocking all traffic except port 80, and then load balancing the allowed port 80 traffic across three destination IP addresses. This is an example of chaining together two separate actions in a sequential manner. The other options either perform a single action or combine actions in parallel, but do not exhibit sequential composition.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is partially correct but incomplete. While option d is a valid example of sequential composition, it is not the only correct choice. Option c also demonstrates sequential composition by first blocking all traffic except port 80 and then counting the number of packets that are blocked. The original answer fails to recognize this additional correct option.

Correct Answer: c, d. Both options c and d exhibit sequential composition by chaining together two separate actions in a specific order.

e. Load balance traffic across multiple destination IP addresses and perform routing to the resulting destination IP addresses.","a,c,d","a,e","a,e","Parallel composition involves applying multiple policies or actions to the same traffic simultaneously. In choice (a), load balancing is performed on traffic that matches either of two conditions (source prefix or destination port), which is an example of parallel composition. Similarly, choice (e) applies both load balancing and routing policies to the same traffic, another case of parallel composition. The other choices describe sequential or conditional compositions rather than parallel.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation. Choices (a) and (e) are indeed examples of parallel composition, where multiple policies or actions are applied simultaneously to the same traffic. The answer correctly identifies that the other choices represent sequential or conditional compositions rather than parallel composition.

The '>>' operator in Pyretic represents a sequential composition, meaning the first policy is applied followed by the second policy. The '+' operator represents parallel composition, allowing the two policies to be applied independently. Options a, c, d, and e use incorrect combinations of these operators for the desired traffic forwarding.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The Pyretic rule in option b accurately represents the desired traffic forwarding behavior. It uses the '>>' operator for sequential composition to first match the source IP addresses and then modify the destination IP addresses accordingly. The '+' operator is used for parallel composition to apply the two forwarding policies independently for the two different source-destination IP address pairs.

94,Which of the following might be examples that would use a dynamic policy in Pyretic? Select all that apply.,"a. Check each new traffic flow against a list of permitted and prohibited source IP addresses that may change over time.
b. Drop all traffic arriving from source IP addresses in prefix 10.0.0.0/8.
c. Assign each new traffic flow to a different destination IP address based on a round-robin load balancing policy across servers.
d. Count all traffic arriving from source IP addresses in prefix 10.0.0.0/8.
e. Forward traffic through the network based on shortest paths routing, re-routing traffic appropriately when links or nodes fail.","a,c,e","a,c,e","a,c,e","Dynamic policies in Pyretic are used when the policy needs to change based on network conditions or external inputs. From the given choices:a. Checking traffic against a changing list of permitted/prohibited IPs would require a dynamic policy to adapt to the updates.c. Round-robin load balancing assigns flows to different destination IPs in a cyclic manner, requiring the policy to change for each new flow. e. Routing based on shortest paths and re-routing when topology changes both require the forwarding policy to adapt dynamically to current network state.In contrast, b and d describe static policies that either always drop traffic from a fixed prefix or always count that traffic, without any dynamic behavior.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer and explanation are correct and thorough. The answer correctly identifies the three examples (a, c, and e) that would require dynamic policies in Pyretic due to their need to adapt to changing conditions or inputs. The explanation provides clear reasoning for why each of these choices represents a dynamic policy, while also pointing out why the other two choices (b and d) are static policies that do not change based on network state.
