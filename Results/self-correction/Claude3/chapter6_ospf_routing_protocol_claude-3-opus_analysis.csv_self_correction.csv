What command will you type in order to confirm the OSPF interface costs?","a. show ip ospf
b. show ip ospf interface brief
c. show ospf brief
d. show ospf interface brief
",b,b,b,"To confirm the OSPF interface costs configured on the router interfaces, you should use the command 'show ip ospf interface brief'. This command provides a concise overview of OSPF-enabled interfaces, including their associated costs. The other options do not provide the specific information needed to verify the interface costs.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The command 'show ip ospf interface brief' is the most appropriate choice to confirm the OSPF interface costs configured on the router interfaces. This command provides a concise summary of OSPF-enabled interfaces and their associated costs, which is exactly what is needed to verify the configuration made by the senior network engineer.

The other options are not suitable for this purpose:
a. 'show ip ospf' provides general OSPF information but does not specifically focus on interface costs.
c. 'show ospf brief' is an invalid command.
d. 'show ospf interface brief' is also an invalid command, as the correct syntax includes 'ip' after 'show'.

108,You have been tasked to list the OSPF neighbors off interface serial 1/0. Which command will you type to complete the task?,"a. show ip ospf neighbor serial 0/1
b. show ip ospf neighbor serial 1/0
c. show ip ospf neighbor fastethernet 0/1
d. show ip ospf serial 0/1",b,b,b,"To list the OSPF neighbors off a specific interface, you use the command 'show ip ospf neighbor [interface]'. In this case, the correct interface is serial 1/0, so the full command would be 'show ip ospf neighbor serial 1/0'. The other options either have the wrong interface type (fastethernet instead of serial) or the wrong interface number (0/1 instead of 1/0).","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. To list the OSPF neighbors off a specific interface, the proper command syntax is ""show ip ospf neighbor [interface]"". In this case, the question asks for the OSPF neighbors off interface serial 1/0, so the correct command is ""show ip ospf neighbor serial 1/0"". The explanation provided in the original answer accurately points out why the other options are incorrect, either due to specifying the wrong interface type (fastethernet instead of serial) or using the wrong interface number (0/1 instead of 1/0).

109,"The routing protocol that was designed and intended
for use between different autonomous systems is called
____________________________.","a. interior gateway protocol
b. different gateway protocol
c. autonomous gateway protocol
d. exterior gateway protocol
",d,d,d,"Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) is the routing protocol designed for exchanging routing information between different autonomous systems (ASes). EGP allows routers in different ASes to share reachability information and determine the best path to reach networks in other ASes. Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) like OSPF and EIGRP, on the other hand, are used within a single AS.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) is indeed the routing protocol designed for exchanging routing information between different autonomous systems (ASes). The explanation provided is accurate and clearly distinguishes EGP from Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) used within a single AS.

110,"Given the following OSPF network commands,
type the wildcard masks to match the requirement.
Requirement: Match addresses that begin with 110.20
Command: network 110.20.0.0 {wildcard mask}
Which of the following wildcard mask will you use to meet the
requirement?","a. 0.0.255.255
b. 0.0.0.255
c. 0.255.255.255
d. 0.0.0.0",a,a,a,"To match addresses that begin with 110.20, the wildcard mask should allow any value in the third and fourth octets. The wildcard mask 0.0.255.255 achieves this by using 0's in the first two octets to exactly match 110.20, and 255's in the last two octets to allow any value from 0 to 255.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The wildcard mask 0.0.255.255 is the appropriate choice to match addresses that begin with 110.20. The first two octets (110.20) are fixed, so they should have 0's in the wildcard mask. The last two octets can be any value, so they should have 255's in the wildcard mask. This allows the network command to match any IP address that starts with 110.20, regardless of the values in the third and fourth octets.

d. Both routers’ interfaces use an OSPF Dead interval of 80",c,c,c,"If two routers are configured with the same OSPF router ID, they will not be able to form an OSPF neighbor relationship. The router ID must be unique for each router in the OSPF domain. The other options - having IP addresses in the same subnet, using the same OSPF process ID, and having the same OSPF dead interval - are all normal and expected configurations for routers to become OSPF neighbors on the same LAN segment.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. If two routers are configured with the same OSPF router ID, they will not be able to form an OSPF neighbor relationship because the router ID must be unique for each router in the OSPF domain. The other options mentioned - having IP addresses in the same subnet, using the same OSPF process ID, and having the same OSPF dead interval - are all normal and expected configurations for routers to become OSPF neighbors on the same LAN segment. Therefore, the only setting that would prevent the two routers from becoming OSPF neighbors is if they both use the same router ID (option c).
