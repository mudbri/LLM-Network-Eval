21,Which of the following commands checks the status of the interfaces?,"a. show interface
b. show status
c. show interface status
d. show status interface
",c,c,c,"The command 'show interface status' is used to check the status of interfaces on a Cisco device. It provides a summary of the interfaces, their status (up/down), duplex mode, and speed. The other options listed are not valid Cisco IOS commands for checking interface status.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The command 'show interface status' is indeed the proper command to check the status of interfaces on a Cisco device. It provides a concise summary of each interface, including the port status, duplex mode, and speed. The other options given are either incomplete or invalid commands.

22,You are in console line configuration mode. Which of the following commands would place you in enable mode?,"a. end
b. back
c. enable
d. change
",a,a,a,"The 'end' command is used to exit from any configuration mode and return to enable mode. It essentially moves you up the configuration mode hierarchy until you reach enable mode. The other options are incorrect: 'back' is not a valid command, 'enable' is used to enter enable mode from user EXEC mode (not configuration mode), and 'change' is not a standard Cisco IOS command.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is incorrect. The 'end' command will exit configuration mode and return you to privileged EXEC mode, not enable mode. Enable mode is not a term typically used in Cisco IOS. The correct command to exit from console line configuration mode to privileged EXEC mode is 'end'.

23,Which of the following commands copies the configuration from RAM into NVRAM,"a. copy running-config startup-config
b. copy startup-config running-config
c. copy ram nvram
d. copy nvram ram
",a,a,a,The command 'copy running-config startup-config' is used to copy the current running configuration in RAM (Random Access Memory) to the startup configuration stored in NVRAM (Non-Volatile Random Access Memory). This ensures that the changes made to the running configuration are saved and will be loaded when the device reboots.,"Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The 'copy running-config startup-config' command is indeed used to copy the current running configuration from RAM to NVRAM, saving any changes made so they persist across reboots.

The other options are incorrect:
b. 'copy startup-config running-config' would copy the saved configuration from NVRAM to RAM, overwriting the current running config.
c. 'copy ram nvram' is not a valid Cisco IOS command.
d. 'copy nvram ram' is also not a valid Cisco IOS command.

Therefore, only option 'a' correctly describes the command to copy the running configuration to the startup configuration.

24,"The command that configures the switch as a DHCP client to discover its IPv4 address, mask, and default gateway is ip address dhcp.","a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",a,b,b,"The command 'ip address dhcp' is used to configure an interface on a Cisco router, not a switch, to obtain its IPv4 address, subnet mask, and default gateway from a DHCP server. Switches do not typically act as DHCP clients. Instead, they are usually configured with static IP addresses or act as DHCP servers for other devices on the network.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The command 'ip address dhcp' is indeed used on Cisco routers, not switches, to configure an interface to obtain its IPv4 address, subnet mask, and default gateway from a DHCP server. Switches are usually configured with static IP addresses or act as DHCP servers, but they do not typically act as DHCP clients themselves.

25,In which of the following modes of the CLI could you configure the duplex setting for interface Fast Ethernet 0/2?,"a. Global configuration mode
b. Enable mode
c. Interface configuration mode
d. VLAN mode
",c,c,c,"The duplex setting for a specific interface can only be configured from interface configuration mode. To enter interface configuration mode, you must first enter global configuration mode using the 'configure terminal' command, and then specify the interface using the 'interface' command followed by the interface identifier, in this case 'interface FastEthernet 0/2'.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. To configure interface-specific settings like duplex mode, you need to be in interface configuration mode for that particular interface. The explanation provided accurately describes the steps to enter interface configuration mode for the Fast Ethernet 0/2 interface.

26,Which of the following commands administratively enables an interface,"a. shutdown
b. no shutdown
c. enable interface
d. interface enable
",b,b,b,"The 'no shutdown' command is used to administratively enable an interface on Cisco devices. The 'shutdown' command disables the interface, while 'enable interface' and 'interface enable' are not valid Cisco IOS commands.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The 'no shutdown' command is indeed the proper command to administratively enable an interface on Cisco devices. The answer provides accurate information about the 'shutdown' command disabling the interface and correctly points out that 'enable interface' and 'interface enable' are not valid Cisco IOS commands.

27,"Switches use STP to prevent loops by causing some interfaces to block, meaning that they do not send or receive frames.","a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",a,a,a,"The statement is true. Switches use the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to logically block redundant links in order to prevent switching loops in a network with physically redundant links. By blocking certain interfaces, STP ensures a loop-free topology where frames are not endlessly circulated. The blocked interfaces do not forward frames, thus avoiding broadcast storms and MAC address table instability caused by switching loops.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. Switches indeed use the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to prevent loops in a network with redundant links. STP works by blocking certain interfaces, preventing them from sending or receiving frames, thus ensuring a loop-free topology. This is necessary to avoid issues like broadcast storms and MAC address table instability that can occur when loops are present in a switched network.

28,A Layer 2 switch configuration places all its physical ports into VLAN 2. The IP addressing plan shows that address 175.28.1.150 (with mask 255.255.255.0) is reserved for use by this new LAN switch and that 175.28.1.254 is already configured on the router connected to that same VLAN. The switch needs to support SSH connections into the switch from any subnet in the network. Which of the following commands are part of the required configuration in this case? (Choose two answers.),"a. The switch cannot support SSH because all its ports connect to VLAN 2, and the IP address must be configured on interface VLAN 1.
b. The ip address 175.28.1.150 255.255.255.0 command in interface vlan 2 configuration mode.
c. The ip default-gateway 175.28.1.254 command in global configuration mode.
d. The ip address 172.16.2.250 255.255.255.0 command in interface vlan 1 configuration mode.
e. The ip default-gateway 175.28.1.150 command in global configuration mode.","b,c","b,c","b,c","To configure the Layer 2 switch with the given IP address and enable SSH access, the switch needs an IP address on the VLAN interface corresponding to the VLAN where all ports are assigned (VLAN 2 in this case). This is done with the 'ip address 175.28.1.150 255.255.255.0' command in interface vlan 2 configuration mode. Additionally, the switch needs a default gateway configured to reach other subnets, which is set with the 'ip default-gateway 175.28.1.254' command in global configuration mode, using the router's IP address in that VLAN.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. To properly configure the Layer 2 switch, it needs an IP address assigned to the VLAN interface for VLAN 2 since all ports are placed in that VLAN. The 'ip address 175.28.1.150 255.255.255.0' command under interface vlan 2 accomplishes this. Furthermore, to enable the switch to communicate with other subnets and support SSH access from any subnet, a default gateway needs to be set using the 'ip default-gateway 175.28.1.254' global configuration command, pointing to the IP address of the connected router interface in VLAN 2.
