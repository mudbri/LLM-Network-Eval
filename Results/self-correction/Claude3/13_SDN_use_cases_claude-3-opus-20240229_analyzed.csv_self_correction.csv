95,What are some benefits to using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Host configuration is simpler, since all hosts are visible from a single large Ethernet topology.
b. Forwarding on physical MAC addresses is simpler, since both the data center network topology and hosts' physical MAC addresses are hierarchical.
c. IP routing does not need to be reconfigured when physical or virtual machines move from one part of the network to another.
d. Scaling problems are simpler, since all hosts are configured on a single, flat topology.
e. Load balancing is easier on a layer-2 topology than on a layer 3 topology.","a,c","a,c","a,c.Thesearetheonlytwocorrectstatementsaboutthebenefitsofusingalayer-2MACtopologyacrossanentiredatacenter.","Using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center provides benefits in terms of simpler host configuration, since all hosts are visible on a single large Ethernet topology. This also means that IP routing does not need to be reconfigured when physical or virtual machines move within the network. However, forwarding based on physical MAC addresses is not necessarily simpler in a large flat topology compared to a hierarchical one. Scaling can also be more challenging with a single flat topology due to broadcast domains and MAC address table limitations. Load balancing is not inherently easier at layer-2 compared to layer-3.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is partially correct. It correctly identifies that using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center simplifies host configuration (choice a) and eliminates the need to reconfigure IP routing when machines move (choice c). However, it does not address the other choices.

Regarding choice b, forwarding based on physical MAC addresses is actually more complex in a large flat layer-2 topology compared to a hierarchical layer-3 topology. MAC address tables can become very large and unwieldy.

For choice d, scaling is more problematic with large flat layer-2 topologies due to issues like broadcast storms and MAC address table overflow. Segmenting the network hierarchically helps contain these problems.

Finally, for choice e, the type of topology (layer-2 vs layer-3) does not inherently make load balancing easier or harder. Load balancing depends more on the capabilities of the load balancing solution.

In summary, the original answer is incomplete as it does not evaluate all the given choices.

Correct Answer: a, c. These are the only two correct statements about the benefits of using a layer-2 MAC topology across an entire data center.",1,0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.19999999999999996
96,"In PortLand, what are the reasons for assigning hosts pseudo-MAC addresses, as opposed to simply forwarding traffic on physical MAC addresses? Select all that apply.","a. Hosts in the data-center network topology are more vulnerable to attack if they expose their actual physical MAC addresses, rather than having a layer of indirection.
b. It is very difficult to load balance traffic using physical MAC addresses; pseudo MAC addresses make it possible to assign traffic to destination IP addresses.
c. Without pseudo-MAC addresses, switches would have to update forwarding state whenever hosts with a particular MAC address moved from one portion of the topology to another.
d. Forwarding loops are be more common in a flat layer-2 topology than they are in a topology with hierarchical pseudo MAC addresses.
e. In a flat layer-2 topology, switches cannot know on which port to forward traffic without maintaining switch tables for each MAC address, since MAC addresses are flat, not hierarchical.","c,e","c,e","c,e","Pseudo-MAC addresses are used in PortLand for two main reasons:1) Without pseudo-MAC addresses that encode location information, switches would need to update forwarding state whenever a host moves in the network, since the flat physical MAC addresses provide no information about location (c).  2) In a flat layer-2 topology using physical MAC addresses, switches cannot determine the appropriate outgoing port for a frame just by looking at the destination MAC address, since MAC addresses are flat. They would need to maintain large MAC tables (e).","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation for the two main reasons why PortLand uses pseudo-MAC addresses instead of physical MAC addresses. The answer correctly identifies that options c and e are the applicable reasons. Without pseudo-MAC addresses encoding location information, switches would need to update forwarding state when hosts move (c) and maintain large MAC tables to determine outgoing ports (e) in a flat layer-2 topology using physical MAC addresses.

97,What are the steps involved in the Proxy ARP process that PortLand's Fabric Manager runs?,"a. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns returns PMAC directly to the end host.
b. Edge switch sends ARP query to fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch updates its local PMAC mapping table.
c. Host sends ARP query, fabric manager intercepts ARP query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to end host.
d. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to the host.
e. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch returns PMAC to end host.
",e,e,e,"In the PortLand architecture, the Proxy ARP process involves the following steps: (1) The host sends an ARP query to resolve the MAC address of the destination. (2) The edge switch intercepts this ARP query and redirects it to the fabric manager. (3) The fabric manager consults its PMAC (Pseudo MAC) mapping table to determine the PMAC address corresponding to the destination IP. (4) The fabric manager returns this PMAC address to the edge switch. (5) Finally, the edge switch sends the PMAC address back to the requesting host in an ARP reply. This allows the host to populate its ARP cache with the PMAC of the destination and send frames using this PMAC.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. It accurately describes the steps involved in the Proxy ARP process used by the fabric manager in the PortLand architecture. The host sends an ARP query which is intercepted by the edge switch and redirected to the fabric manager. The fabric manager looks up the PMAC address corresponding to the destination IP in its mapping table and returns this PMAC to the edge switch. The edge switch then sends the PMAC to the requesting host in the ARP reply.

98,"What are some of the disadvantages of today's interdomain routing protocol, BGP? Select all that apply.","a. ISPs cannot load-balance traffic across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix.
b. Routing and forwarding decisions are only based on IP prefix, not on a broader range of traffic flow attributes.
c. ISPs can only influence route selection through indirect mechanisms (e.g., prepending), rather than directly manipulating the forwarding table entries in switches.
d. ISPs cannot express preference of one route over another, given multiple routes to a destination.
e. ISPs can only influence the routing decisions of their immediate neighbor, not the entire end-to-end path.
","b,c,e","b,c,e","b,c,e","The main disadvantages of BGP are: (b) routing and forwarding decisions are only based on IP prefix, not considering other traffic flow attributes; (c) ISPs can only influence route selection indirectly through mechanisms like AS path prepending, rather than directly manipulating forwarding tables; and (e) an ISP can only influence the routing decisions of its immediate neighbors, but not the entire end-to-end path. Choices (a) and (d) are incorrect because BGP does allow ISPs to load-balance traffic across multiple routes to the same destination prefix and express preference of one route over another.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation for why choices b, c, and e are the disadvantages of BGP. It correctly identifies that BGP's routing decisions are limited to IP prefixes only, ISPs can only indirectly influence routing, and an ISP's influence is limited to its immediate neighbors. The answer also correctly explains why choices a and d are not disadvantages of BGP.

101,What are some of the features that an SDX enables that today's IXPs cannot support? Select all that apply.,"a. Application of different business relationships across different regions of the world (e.g., peering only in a specific geographic region).
b. Application-specific peering
c. Wide-area load balancing using DNS-based redirection
d. On-the-fly redirection to middleboxes
e. Wide-area load balancing using IP packet rewriting
","b,d,e","a,b,d","a,b,d","An SDX (Software Defined Exchange) enables several features that traditional Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) cannot support, including: a) Applying different business relationships across different regions, allowing peering to be restricted to specific geographic areas. b) Application-specific peering, where peering relationships can be established based on the application or traffic type. d) On-the-fly redirection of traffic to middleboxes for services like security filtering, load balancing, etc. The other options, c) and e), relate to wide-area load balancing techniques that are not specifically enabled by SDX capabilities.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. An SDX (Software-Defined Internet Exchange) enables several features that traditional IXPs cannot support, including:

a) Applying different business relationships across regions, allowing peering to be restricted geographically. This is possible because SDX uses software-defined networking to control routing policies flexibly.

b) Application-specific peering, where peering relationships are based on the application or traffic type. SDX can steer traffic based on application, allowing this granular peering.

d) On-the-fly redirection of traffic to middleboxes for services like security, load balancing, etc. SDX's programmability allows dynamic redirection of traffic through middleboxes.

The other options, c) and e), relate to wide-area load balancing techniques using DNS or IP rewriting. While an SDX could potentially enable these, they are not distinguishing SDX features compared to traditional IXPs. Load balancing is typically handled by the individual networks, not the IXP/SDX itself.

103,What are some of the motivations for applying software defined networking in home networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Better performance, since control decisions can be made from a well-provisioned server, as opposed to an under-provisioned router.
b. Ability to better user interfaces to control home network behavior, independent of the interfaces that ship with home router devices.
c. Ability to allow multiple service providers access to the home network infrastructure for different applications and services.
d. Outsourcing control and management of the home network to a third party.
e. More fine-grained control over the forwarding behavior of individual devices as conditions in the network change (e.g., a device uses too much bandwidth or data).

While a well-provisioned SDN controller could potentially improve performance compared to an under-provisioned home router (a), this is not a primary motivation for SDN in home networks.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is mostly correct but includes one option that is not a strong motivation for applying SDN in home networks. While an SDN controller hosted in the cloud or by a service provider may have more resources than a typical home router, improving performance is not usually cited as a key reason for using SDN in homes.

The other motivations listed around enabling better interfaces, multi-provider access, outsourced management, and fine-grained control are all valid and commonly discussed benefits of SDN for home networks. However, the performance rationale in option (a) is questionable.

Correct Answer: b, c, d, e. The primary motivations for SDN in home networks are enabling UI innovation (b), multi-provider services (c), outsourced control (d), and granular traffic management (e). While an argument could be made for (a), it is not a core driver for most SDN-based home network solutions.",1,0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.0
104,"Suppose that an operator of a home network wants to write the following policy:
1. Block all traffic to Facebook from my child's computer.
2. Rate limit BitTorrent traffic from my child's computer if the VoIP client on my desktop is active.
Which of the following most closely approximates the policy?  Assume that ""facebook"" represents Facebook IP addresses, that ""bittorrent"" represents BitTorrent ports, and that ""limitifVOIP"" is a dynamic policy that checks a Resonance-like state machine to determine whether VOIP traffic has recently been observed.","a. (match(srcip=child, dstip=facebook) + drop) + (match(srcip=child, dstport=bittorrent) + dynamic(limitIfVOIP))
b. (match(srcip=child, dstip=facebook) >> drop) >> (match(srcip=child, dstport=bittorrent) >> dynamic(limitIfVOIP))
c. (match(srcip=child, dstip=facebook) >> drop) + (match(srcip=child, dstport=bittorrent) >> dynamic(limitIfVOIP))
d. (match(srcip=child, dstip=facebook) + drop) >> (match(srcip=child, dstport=bittorrent) + dynamic(limitIfVOIP))
",c,c,c,"The policy requires two independent actions: (1) blocking all Facebook traffic from the child's computer, and (2) rate limiting BitTorrent traffic from the child's computer if VoIP is active on the desktop. Option c correctly captures this by using the '+' operator to combine two separate policies. The first policy matches the child's source IP and Facebook destination IP, and drops the traffic. The second policy matches the child's source IP and BitTorrent destination ports, and applies dynamic rate limiting based on the VoIP state. Options a and d incorrectly use '+' where '>>' should be used for sequential policies. Option b applies the policies sequentially which is not the desired behavior.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer correctly identifies option c as the best choice to implement the desired network policy. It accurately explains why options a, b, and d are incorrect due to improper use of the '+' and '>>' operators for combining the policy components.

However, the explanation could be improved by clarifying that the '+' operator is used to combine policies in parallel (i.e., apply both policies independently to each packet), while the '>>' operator is used to apply policies sequentially (i.e., apply the second policy only to packets that match the first policy).
