91,You have noticed that a server with IP 145.45.3.2 doesn’t respond to requests. What command will you type first in order to test connectivity between your device and the server?,"a. request 145.45.3.2
b. check 145.45.3.2
c. ping 145.45.3.2
d. ping 145.45.3.2",c,c,c,"The 'ping' command is the correct choice to test connectivity between your device and the server with IP address 145.45.3.2. Ping uses ICMP echo request and echo reply messages to determine if a host is reachable and responsive on an IP network. It measures the round-trip time for messages and reports errors or packet loss, making it a simple but effective tool for troubleshooting network connectivity issues.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The 'ping' command is indeed the appropriate choice for testing connectivity between your device and the server with IP address 145.45.3.2. The explanation provided is accurate and clearly explains why ping is used for this purpose.

92,"A LAN design uses a Layer 3 EtherChannel between two switches SW1 and SW2, with port-channel interface 1 used on both switches. SW1 uses ports G0/1 and G0/2 in the channel. However, only interface G0/1 is bundled into the channel and working. Think about the configuration settings on port G0/2 that could have existed before adding G0/2 to the EtherChannel. Which answers identify a setting that could prevent IOS from adding G0/2 to the Layer 3 EtherChannel? (Choose two answers.)","a. A different STP cost (spanning-tree cost value)
b. A different access VLAN (switchport access vlan vlanid)
c. A different speed (speed value)
d. A default setting for switchport (switchport)
","c,d","b,d","b,d","The correct answers are b and d. For a Layer 3 EtherChannel, the physical interfaces must not be configured as switchports (Layer 2 ports). If interface G0/2 was previously configured with the 'switchport' command (answer d) or assigned to a different access VLAN with 'switchport access vlan' (answer b), it would be operating as a Layer 2 port and could not join the Layer 3 EtherChannel. The STP cost (answer a) and interface speed (answer c) do not impact an interface's ability to join a Layer 3 EtherChannel.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a clear explanation. It correctly identifies that having the ""switchport"" command configured (choice d) or being assigned to a different access VLAN with ""switchport access vlan"" (choice b) would prevent the interface from joining a Layer 3 EtherChannel. The answer also correctly notes that STP cost and interface speed do not impact the ability to join a Layer 3 EtherChannel. No issues or inaccuracies noted.

93,"A network engineer has configured a Layer 3 switch with SVIs for VLANs 4 and 5. Hosts in the subnets using VLANs 4 and 5 can ping each other with the Layer 3 switch routing the packets. The next week, the network engineer receives a call that those same users can no longer ping each other. If the problem is with the Layer 3 switching function, which of the following could have caused the problem? (Choose two answers.)","a. A shutdown command issued from VLAN 4 configuration mode
b. VTP on the switch removing VLAN 5 from the switch’s VLAN list
c. 1 out of 10 working VLAN 4 access ports failing due to physical problems
d. A shutdown command issued from VLAN 6 configuration mode","a,b","a,b","a,b","The most likely causes of the Layer 3 switching function failing between VLANs 4 and 5 are:a) Issuing a 'shutdown' command in VLAN 4 configuration mode would administratively disable the SVI for VLAN 4, preventing Layer 3 switching to that VLAN.  b) If VTP is enabled and VLAN 5 is removed from the VLAN list on the VTP server, it would propagate that change to the Layer 3 switch, deleting the SVI for VLAN 5 and breaking Layer 3 connectivity.The other options would not directly impact Layer 3 switching:c) A single access port failing in VLAN 4 would only affect the host connected to that port, not all hosts in VLANs 4 and 5.d) A 'shutdown' command for VLAN 6 would have no effect on VLANs 4 and 5.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation for why options a and b are the most likely causes of the Layer 3 switching problem between VLANs 4 and 5. The answer correctly identifies that issuing a 'shutdown' command on the SVI for VLAN 4 would disable Layer 3 switching for that VLAN. It also correctly notes that if VTP removed VLAN 5 from the VLAN list, it would delete the corresponding SVI and break connectivity. The explanations for why options c and d are incorrect are also valid. A single port failure would only impact one host, not all inter-VLAN communication, and shutting down an unrelated VLAN 6 would not affect VLANs 4 and 5.

97,The commands ping and traceroute send messages in the network to test connectivity and rely on other devices to send back a reply,"a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",a,a,a,"The statement is true. The ping command sends ICMP echo request messages to a specified host and expects ICMP echo reply messages back to determine reachability and round-trip time. Similarly, traceroute sends a series of messages with increasing TTL values to discover the path a packet takes to a destination, relying on ICMP time exceeded messages from intermediate routers and an ICMP port unreachable message from the destination.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The explanation provided accurately describes how the ping and traceroute commands function by sending messages and relying on replies from other network devices to test connectivity and determine the network path. No issues or inaccuracies are found in the answer.
