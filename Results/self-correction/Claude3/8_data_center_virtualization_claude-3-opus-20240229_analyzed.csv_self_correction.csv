62,Which of the following are true of “network slicing”? Select all that apply.,"a. Network operators can use slicing to test configurations on “shadow” networks that mirror a production network topology.
b. One way to slice networks is according to “flow space”, whereby different controllers might control distinct and non-overlapping traffic flows.
c. A controller can prevent one network slice from interfering with the resources of another.
d. Multi-tenant datacenters are one use case for network slicing.
e. Conventional (i.e., non-SDN) networks have no concept of network virtualization or slicing.
","a,b,d","a,b,c,d","a,b,c,d.Theoriginalanswercorrectlyselectedtheseoptions,butshouldhavealsoincludedthatoptioneisfalsetoprovideacompleteanswertothequestionofselectingalltruestatementsaboutnetworkslicing.","Network slicing allows creating multiple virtual networks on top of a shared physical infrastructure. This enables (a) testing configurations on shadow networks mirroring production, (b) slicing by flow space where controllers handle distinct traffic flows, (c) resource isolation between slices, and (d) multi-tenancy in data centers. However, (e) is incorrect as conventional networks do have concepts like VLANs for basic virtualization, though SDN enables more advanced slicing.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is mostly correct but incomplete. It correctly identifies that options a, b, c, and d are true statements about network slicing. However, it fails to recognize that option e is also incorrect. Conventional networks do have some basic forms of network virtualization and slicing, such as VLANs, even though SDN enables more advanced and flexible slicing capabilities.

Correct Answer: a, b, c, d. The original answer correctly selected these options, but should have also included that option e is false to provide a complete answer to the question of selecting all true statements about network slicing.",0,0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.0
63,Which of the following are true about flow spaces? Select all that apply.,"a. Two flow spaces cannot overlap.
b. One host could send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces.
c. Flow spaces can only be defined according to combinations of packet header fields.
d. Flowspace isolation separates individual virtual networks from one another but incurs some performance penalty for doing so.
e. Two controllers that write data-plane rules for non-overlapping parts of flowspace can never cause traffic from one “slice” to enter the other slice.
",b,"b,d","b,d","Two statements are true about flow spaces:b) One host could indeed send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces. Flow spaces can overlap, so a single host's traffic could match rules in multiple flow spaces.  d) Flowspace isolation does separate individual virtual networks but at the cost of some performance overhead to enforce the isolation between slices.The other statements are incorrect:a) Flow spaces can overlap, so this is false.c) Flow spaces can be defined by other attributes beyond just packet headers, such as physical ports. e) Even with non-overlapping flow spaces, misconfiguration or bugs could cause leakage of traffic between slices if the isolation is not robustly enforced.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation for each choice. It correctly identifies that options b and d are true statements about flow spaces, while a, c, and e are false. The justifications provided for each selection are accurate and sufficiently detailed.

64,Which of the following describe the control-plane checks that FlowVisor implements? Select all that apply.,"a. When a packet must be forwarded to a controller, Flowvisor forwards traffic to the correct controller based on which controller “owns” the flowspace corresponding to that packet.
b. Flowvisor prevents each slice's controller from being the target of a denial of service attack from other slices.
c. Flowvisor can only instantiate network slices based on the network topology, not based on other properties, such as application traffic.
d. Flowvisor prevents a controller from writing data-plane rules to a part of flowspace that it does not own.
e. Flowvisor installs traffic shaping and quality of service rules to ensure that each network slice has guaranteed resources.
","a,d","a,d","a,d","FlowVisor performs control-plane checks to ensure that each controller only operates within its assigned flowspace. This includes (a) forwarding packets to the correct controller based on flowspace ownership, and (d) preventing controllers from writing data-plane rules to flowspace they do not own. FlowVisor does not implement specific DoS protection between slices (b), can define slices based on various properties beyond just topology (c), and does not directly handle traffic shaping or QoS (e).","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation. It correctly identifies that options a and d describe control-plane checks implemented by FlowVisor, while b, c, and e are incorrect. The explanation provides additional context on why each option is correct or incorrect.

65,Which of the following are applications in a home network that network slicing could enable? Select all that apply.,"a. Quality of service for certain applications (e.g., video streaming)
b. Traceback of attack traffic to its source
c. Smart grid applications
d. Load balance of inbound traffic
e. Guest WiFi access
","a,c,e","a,c,e","a,c,e",Network slicing in a home network could enable:a) Quality of service for certain applications like video streaming by dedicating specific network resources to ensure smooth performance.  c) Smart grid applications by allocating a separate secure slice for energy management devices to communicate.e) Guest WiFi access by creating an isolated slice that keeps guest traffic separate from the main home network for security.Choices b and d relate more to security and traffic management which are not directly enabled by network slicing.,"Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation for each selected choice. It correctly identifies that network slicing in a home network could enable quality of service for applications like video streaming (a), support smart grid applications through a secure dedicated slice (c), and provide isolated guest WiFi access (e). The answer also properly explains why the other two choices, traceback of attack traffic (b) and load balancing of inbound traffic (d), are not directly enabled by network slicing as they relate more to security and traffic management.

69,What are examples of multi-tenant datacenter applications? Select all that apply.,"a. Amazon hosting EC2 instances for customers
b. A home network owner running a private and public WiFi network
c. A retailer running a large, multi-site enterprise network across its global network of sites
d. Google running Gmail and search from a common facility
e. Two enterprises hosting data in a shared facility.","a,d,e","a,d,e","a,d,e","Multi-tenant datacenter applications involve a single provider hosting services for multiple customers or 'tenants' from a shared facility or infrastructure. Amazon hosting EC2 instances for customers (a), Google running Gmail and search from a common facility (d), and two enterprises hosting data in a shared facility (e) are all examples of multi-tenancy in a datacenter environment. A home network with private and public WiFi (b) and a retailer's global enterprise network (c) do not represent multi-tenant datacenter applications as they involve single organizations using dedicated infrastructure.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a clear explanation for why options a, d, and e are examples of multi-tenant datacenter applications, while b and c are not. The key aspect of multi-tenancy is that a single provider hosts services for multiple customers or tenants from a shared facility or infrastructure. The answer correctly identifies that Amazon hosting EC2 instances, Google running Gmail and search, and two enterprises hosting data in a shared facility all fit this definition. It also explains why a home network with private and public WiFi and a retailer's global enterprise network do not represent multi-tenant datacenter applications, as they involve single organizations using dedicated infrastructure.

70,What best describes the relationship between network virtualization and SDN? Select all that apply.,"a. SDN controllers can help manage storage and data facilities, in addition to network configuration
b. SDN predates network virtualization
c. Network virtualization requires SDN
d. SDN makes some aspects of network virtualization easier to manage
e. Network virtualization enables SDN
","a,d","a,d","a,d","SDN controllers can manage various aspects of the network beyond just configuration, including storage and data facilities (a). While network virtualization does not require SDN, SDN can make certain aspects of network virtualization easier to implement and manage (d). Network virtualization as a concept predates SDN (b is incorrect), and network virtualization is an enabler for SDN rather than the other way around (c and e are incorrect).","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is mostly correct. It correctly identifies that SDN controllers can manage various aspects beyond network configuration (a) and that SDN can make certain aspects of network virtualization easier to manage (d). It also correctly points out that network virtualization predates SDN (b is incorrect) and that network virtualization enables SDN, not the other way around (c and e are incorrect).

However, there is one minor issue with the explanation. While network virtualization is indeed an enabler for SDN and makes SDN easier to implement, it is not entirely accurate to say that ""network virtualization enables SDN"" (as stated in the explanation for why c and e are incorrect). SDN can be implemented without network virtualization, although network virtualization makes SDN more powerful and flexible.
