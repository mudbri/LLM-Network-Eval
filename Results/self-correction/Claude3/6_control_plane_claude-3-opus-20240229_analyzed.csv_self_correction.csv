43,Which of the following statements are true about the OpenFlow specification? Select all that apply.,"a. If a switch does not contain a flow table entry that matches a particular packet, the switch forwards the packet to the controller for handling.
b. The main purpose of the OpenFlow control channel is to update flow table entries on switches.
c. The OpenFlow specification provides mechanisms to perform Layer 2 learning across a network of switches.
d. Once a switch has sent one packet for a flow, it must also send all subsequent packets for that flow to the controller.
e. Some versions of the OpenFlow specification allow for performing more than one action on a single packet.","a,b,e","a,b,e","a,b,e","The correct statements about the OpenFlow specification are: a) If a switch does not have a matching flow entry for a packet, it sends the packet to the controller to determine how to handle it. b) The main purpose of the OpenFlow control channel is indeed to allow the controller to update flow table entries on the switches.  e) Later versions of OpenFlow (1.1+) introduced the ability to apply multiple actions to a single packet. Statement c is incorrect because Layer 2 learning is not part of the core OpenFlow spec. Statement d is false; after sending the first packet of a new flow to the controller, the controller can install a flow entry allowing the switch to forward subsequent packets without involving the controller.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides an accurate explanation for each statement. It correctly identifies that options a, b, and e are true statements about the OpenFlow specification, while options c and d are false. The justifications provided for each choice are clear and technically sound.

44,Which of the following statements are true about dpctl? Select all that apply.,"a. dpctl is invoked from within the Mininet emulator.
b. dpctl can modify flow table entries on an OpenFlow switch.
c. dpctl can respond to network events, such as packets sent from a switch.
d. dpctl is an OpenFlow controller.
e. dpctl can inspect flow table entries on an OpenFlow switch.
","b,e","b,e","b,e","dpctl is a command line utility that can be used to inspect and modify flow table entries on an OpenFlow switch. It allows direct interaction with the switch's flow tables to add, delete or modify flow entries. However, dpctl itself is not an OpenFlow controller and does not respond to network events. It is typically invoked from the command line, not from within the Mininet emulator.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. dpctl is indeed a command line utility that can inspect and modify flow table entries on an OpenFlow switch, as stated in options b and e. It is not an OpenFlow controller itself (option d is incorrect) and does not respond to network events like an OpenFlow controller would (option c is incorrect). Additionally, while dpctl can be used in conjunction with Mininet, it is invoked from the command line, not from within the Mininet emulator (option a is incorrect).

47,Which of the following are true about Pox? Select all that apply.,"a. Pox automatically determines the order to install flow table rules, to avoid inconsistent forwarding behavior.
b. Pox's _handle_PacketIn function determines how a packet should be handled when it arrives at the controller.
c. Pox provides a function to modify flow table entries at a switch.
d. Pox's performance is typically slower than NOX.
e. Pox automatically determines the priority between two conflicting rules.
","b,c,d","b,c,d","b,c,d","Option b is correct because in Pox, the _handle_PacketIn function is called when a packet arrives at the controller and determines how it should be processed. Option c is correct as Pox provides an API to modify flow table entries on switches. Option d is also correct since Pox is implemented in Python which typically has slower performance compared to NOX which uses C++. Options a and e are incorrect because Pox does not automatically determine flow rule order or priority - this needs to be explicitly handled by the controller application.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation for each selected option. It correctly identifies that options b, c, and d are true statements about Pox, while options a and e are false. The answer gives specific details about why each selected option is correct, such as mentioning that the _handle_PacketIn function in Pox processes packets arriving at the controller, Pox has an API for modifying switch flow table entries, and Pox's Python implementation is typically slower than NOX which uses C++. It also explains that Pox does not automatically handle flow rule ordering or priority, contrary to what options a and e state. Overall, this is a thorough and accurate answer to the question.

48,What is the difference between a hard timeout and an idle timeout?,"a. A hard timeout occurs exactly at the specified interval, whereas an idle timeout may occur slightly later than the specified interval.
b. A hard timeout expunges a flow table entry regardless of whether there have been active matches, whereas an idle timeout expunges the flow table entry only if there have been no matches for that flow within the specified interval.
c. A hard timeout expunges all flow table entry from the switch, whereas an idle timeout only expunges one flow at a time.
d. A hard timeout expunges a flow table entry for all switches in the network, whereas an idle timeout only expunges the flow table entry on the switches that have seen no matches for that flow within the specified interval.
",b,b,b,"The key difference between a hard timeout and an idle timeout is that a hard timeout expunges a flow table entry after the specified time interval regardless of whether there have been active matches for that flow. In contrast, an idle timeout only expunges the flow table entry if there have been no matches for that specific flow within the specified time interval. So the hard timeout is based purely on the elapsed time, while the idle timeout takes into account the flow activity.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. It accurately describes the key difference between a hard timeout and an idle timeout in the context of flow table entries. A hard timeout removes the flow table entry after a fixed time interval, regardless of flow activity. An idle timeout, on the other hand, only removes the flow table entry if there have been no matches for that specific flow within the configured time period. The answer correctly identifies that the hard timeout is purely time-based, while the idle timeout considers the presence or absence of flow matches.

49,Which of the following are true about hubs and learning switches? Select all that apply,"a. A hub implemented in Pox requires all incoming packets to be directed to the controller.
b. A learning switch requires more logic at the controller (in terms of lines of code in Pox) than a hub.
c. A learning switch implemented in Pox can be easily extended to support firewall capabilities.
d. A learning switch implemented in Pox requires all incoming packets to be redirected to the controller.
e. A hub forwards an incoming packet on all ports (except the incoming port), whereas a switch only floods an incoming packet on all ports if it does not have a table entry that determines the output port for that packet.
","b,c,e","c,e","e.Ahubforwardsanincomingpacketonallports(excepttheincomingport),whereasaswitchonlyfloodsanincomingpacketonallportsifitdoesnothaveatableentrythatdeterminestheoutputportforthatpacket.","A learning switch can be extended to support firewall capabilities by adding logic to the controller to filter or block certain packets based on predefined rules. A hub floods incoming packets on all ports except the incoming port, while a learning switch only floods if it doesn't have a matching entry in its MAC address table to determine the output port.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is partially correct. It correctly identifies option e as true, but incorrectly selects option c.

A learning switch implemented in POX does not inherently support firewall capabilities. While it's possible to extend the functionality of a learning switch to include firewall-like behavior, this would require additional logic and code beyond the basic learning switch implementation. The learning switch itself focuses on learning MAC addresses and associating them with switch ports to make forwarding decisions. Firewall functionality typically involves packet filtering based on rules, which is a separate concern.

Options a, b, and d are also incorrect:
a. A hub implemented in POX does not require all incoming packets to be directed to the controller. The hub simply floods packets out of all ports except the incoming port.
b. A learning switch typically requires more controller logic than a hub since it needs to maintain a MAC address table and make forwarding decisions based on it.
d. A learning switch does not require all incoming packets to be redirected to the controller. Only the first packet of a flow is typically sent to the controller to learn the MAC address and make the initial forwarding decision. Subsequent packets are forwarded based on the learned information without involving the controller.

Correct Answer: e. A hub forwards an incoming packet on all ports (except the incoming port), whereas a switch only floods an incoming packet on all ports if it does not have a table entry that determines the output port for that packet.",0,0,6_control_plane,0.0
50,Which of the following functions ensures that the controller will hear PacketIn messages? Select all that apply.,"a. connection.addListeners
b. _handle_PacketIn
c. AddRule
d. init
e. launch
",a,"a,b","a,b","The connection.addListeners function is used to register listeners for various OpenFlow messages, including PacketIn messages. This ensures the controller will receive PacketIn events. The _handle_PacketIn function is the actual handler that processes the received PacketIn messages. The other options - AddRule, init, and launch - are not directly related to enabling the controller to receive PacketIn messages.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation. The connection.addListeners function is indeed used to register listeners for OpenFlow messages like PacketIn, ensuring the controller receives these events. And the _handle_PacketIn function is the handler that actually processes the PacketIn messages when they are received. The other listed functions - AddRule, init, and launch - while potentially part of the controller code, are not specifically responsible for enabling the reception of PacketIn messages.

51,What are the two key steps of an OpenFlow flow table entry (select two)?,"a. match
b. action
c. redirect
d. drop
e. forward
","a,b","a,b","a,b","The two key steps of an OpenFlow flow table entry are match and action. The match step determines if an incoming packet matches the criteria specified in the flow entry. If there is a match, the corresponding action specified in the flow entry is applied to the packet. Actions can include forwarding the packet out a specified port, dropping the packet, or sending it to the controller for further processing.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation. It correctly identifies that the two key steps of an OpenFlow flow table entry are:

a. match - determining if an incoming packet matches the specified criteria in the flow entry
b. action - the corresponding action to take on the packet if there is a match, such as forwarding, dropping, or sending to the controller

The answer also gives helpful examples of what actions can include. No changes or corrections are needed.

52,Which of the following are true about the OpenDaylight controller? Select all that apply.,"a. It allows dynamic reloading of controller functionality without restarting the controller.
b. It only supports OpenFlow as a ""southbound"" control framework.
c. Its code shares a lot of similarities with Beacon.
d. Open Daylight only supports proprietary switches from Cisco and IBM.
e. It is slower and less scalable than some of the more lightweight SDN controllers such as Pox.

This enables adding or modifying features on-the-fly. OpenDaylight's codebase shares similarities with the Beacon controller, as they are both Java-based controllers built on the OSGi framework. However, OpenDaylight supports multiple southbound protocols beyond just OpenFlow, and it is designed to work with switches from various vendors, not just Cisco and IBM. As a full-featured controller, OpenDaylight may have more overhead compared to lightweight controllers like Pox, but it is still designed for performance and scalability in production networks.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is mostly correct but contains one error. While it is true that OpenDaylight allows dynamic reloading of controller functionality and shares code similarities with Beacon, the statement about it being slower and less scalable than lightweight controllers like Pox is not necessarily accurate. OpenDaylight is designed for performance and scalability in production environments, even if it may have more overhead than minimal controllers. The other points about OpenDaylight supporting multiple southbound protocols (not just OpenFlow) and working with switches from various vendors (not just Cisco and IBM) are correct and relevant.

Correct Answer: a, c. The selected options correctly identify the true statements about OpenDaylight - that it allows dynamic reloading of functionality and shares code similarities with Beacon. The other options are false, as OpenDaylight supports multiple southbound protocols, works with multi-vendor switches, and is designed for performance and scalability.",1,0,6_control_plane,0.0
