23,Which of the following are examples of control plane operations? Select all that apply.,"a. Rate-limiting traffic so that the overall sending rate does not exceed a certain throughput.
b. Determining that a user's MAC address is authentic before allowing it to send traffic on the network.
c. Load balancing traffic across two output ports based on the hash of each packet's source IP address.
d. Determining the forwarding path that satisfies an access control policy.
e. Computing a shortest path routing tree.
","b,d,e","d,e","d,e","Control plane operations involve making decisions about how to handle network traffic. This includes tasks like authentication, routing, and access control. Of the given choices, determining the forwarding path that satisfies an access control policy (d) and computing a shortest path routing tree (e) are control plane operations. They involve making high-level decisions about traffic handling. The other choices - rate limiting (a), MAC authentication (b), and load balancing (c) - are data plane operations that enforce the policies set by the control plane on a per-packet basis.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation. It correctly identifies that options d and e are control plane operations, while the others are data plane operations. The answer explains the key distinction - control plane operations make high-level decisions about traffic handling, while data plane operations enforce those policies on individual packets.

25,What could be the operational steps behind the AT&T's IRSCP (a commercial version of the Routing Control Platform) for detecting malicious traffic? Select all that apply.,"a. The controller sees all traffic passing through the network, detects an attack, and installs a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where the attack traffic is originating.
b. The end host changes its IP address so that it is no longer the target of the attack traffic.
c. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to re-route traffic through a deep-packet inspection device.
d. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to install a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where attack traffic is originating.
e. A victim end host sends an alert to an on-path firewall about the source and nature of an attack, at which point the firewall installs a null route to drop the traffic at the entry point where the attack is originating.
","c,d","c,d","c,d","The correct steps for AT&T's IRSCP in detecting and mitigating malicious traffic are:c) A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to re-route traffic through a deep-packet inspection device. This allows detailed analysis of the malicious traffic.d) A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to install a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where attack traffic is originating. This stops the malicious traffic from propagating further into the network.The other options are incorrect because:a) The controller does not see all traffic and directly detect attacks. It relies on a separate measurement system. b) Changing the end host IP does not stop the attack traffic at the entry point.e) The end host does not send an alert directly to an on-path firewall to trigger mitigation.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. It correctly identifies options c and d as the operational steps used by AT&T's IRSCP for detecting and mitigating malicious traffic. The explanation provided for why these are the correct choices and the others are incorrect is sound and matches my understanding of how this type of system works.

26,What are some example network management applications that become easier with control and data plane separation? Select all that apply.,"a. Improved interdomain routing security.
b. Customer-controlled egress selection.
c. Improved logging capabilities.
d. Planned maintenance of an edge router.
e. Forecasting of network capacity.
","a,b,d","b,d","a,b,c,d.Theselectedoptionsusethecorrectformatoflowercaselettersseparatedbycommas.","With the separation of control and data planes in SDN, certain network management tasks become easier. Customer-controlled egress selection (b) is simplified because the control plane can make forwarding decisions based on customer policies without needing to modify the data plane. Planned maintenance of an edge router (d) is also easier because the control plane can proactively reroute traffic away from the router to be serviced without impacting the data plane. While SDN may provide some benefits for the other options, they are not as directly enabled by control and data plane separation.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is partially correct but incomplete. While it correctly identifies that customer-controlled egress selection (b) and planned maintenance of an edge router (d) are network management applications that become easier with control and data plane separation in SDN, it misses a couple of other valid options.

Improved interdomain routing security (a) can also be facilitated by SDN's separation of control and data planes. The centralized control plane can implement security policies and validate routing updates more effectively.

Improved logging capabilities (c) are another benefit of SDN. The control plane can gather comprehensive logging information from the data plane elements for troubleshooting, security analysis, and other purposes.

Forecasting of network capacity (e) is not directly related to control and data plane separation.

27,What are some of the motivations for using Layer-2 forwarding in a data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Ability to use existing routing protocols to establish paths between hosts.
b. Easier configuration/administration, since there is no need to number hosts or configure subnets.
c. Better security properties.
d. Better scaling properties.
e. Better load balancing properties.
",b,"b,d","b,d","The main motivations for using Layer-2 forwarding in a data center are:b) Easier configuration and administration, since there is no need to assign IP addresses to hosts or configure IP subnets. With Layer-2 forwarding, hosts can be plugged in and communicate without additional IP-level configuration.  d) Better scaling properties. Layer-2 forwarding allows for larger Layer-2 domains and avoids the need for large IP routing tables. This can improve scalability, especially in large data centers with many hosts.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct in selecting options b and d as motivations for using Layer-2 forwarding in a data center. The explanations provided for each selected option are accurate and relevant. However, the answer does not evaluate the other options to explain why they were not selected.

To improve the answer, it should briefly address why options a, c, and e are not typically considered motivations for using Layer-2 forwarding in a data center:

a) Layer-2 forwarding does not use routing protocols, so this is not a motivation.
c) Layer-2 forwarding does not inherently provide better security compared to Layer-3 forwarding.
e) Load balancing is not directly related to the choice of Layer-2 or Layer-3 forwarding.

28,How does the separation of the control and data plane make networking in data centers easier?,"a. Virtual machines can be migrated within the network without renumbering entire portions of the network or re-assigning network services to different IP addresses.
b. The control plane allows traffic to be forwarded using Layer 2 addresses, thus allowing automatic load balance across the topology.
c. The separation allows fewer switches to be used in the data center topology, thus lowering costs.
d. All routes can be controlled and monitored from a central point of control.
e. A network controller can permit the renumbering of end hosts to have topology-dependent Layer 2 MAC addresses.","a,d,e","a,d","a,d","Separating the control and data planes in a data center network enables easier management and flexibility. It allows virtual machines to be migrated within the network without the need to renumber network segments or re-assign services to new IP addresses (a). This is because the control plane can manage the network topology and addressing separately from the data plane forwarding. Additionally, having a logically centralized control plane allows all routes to be controlled and monitored from a single point (d), simplifying network operations and troubleshooting.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. Separating the control plane and data plane in data center networks provides several benefits, including the ability to migrate virtual machines within the network without renumbering IP addresses (choice a) and centralized control and monitoring of routing (choice d).

The other choices are incorrect:
b) The control plane does not enable Layer 2 forwarding or automatic load balancing. That is handled by the data plane based on control plane policies.
c) Separating control and data planes does not necessarily reduce the number of switches needed. 
e) Renumbering hosts with topology-dependent Layer 2 MAC addresses is not a benefit of separating control and data planes.

So in summary, choices a and d correctly identify two key advantages of separating the control and data planes in data center networks.

30,What are some approaches to coping with inconsistency across controller replicas? Select all that apply.,"a. Running a consistency protocol across controller replicas.
b. Keeping a ""hot spare"" replica that has a complete view of the network state.
c. Only keeping a subset of the network state in memory at any time.
d. Using different controllers for independent parts of the network.
e. Having multiple controllers install forwarding table entries on the same router and resolving the conflict on the router itself.
","a,b,c,d","a,d","a,d",Two effective approaches for handling inconsistency across SDN controller replicas are:a) Running a consistency protocol across the replicas to ensure they maintain a consistent view of the network state. This allows the replicas to synchronize state changes.d) Partitioning the network and having different controllers manage independent parts. This limits the scope of inconsistency to within each partition.The other options are not ideal because:b) Keeping a hot spare does not actively resolve inconsistencies between active replicas.c) Keeping only a subset of state in memory limits the controller's ability to make optimal decisions.e) Having routers resolve conflicts between multiple controller instructions adds complexity and unpredictability.,"Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation for why options a and d are the best approaches for handling inconsistency across SDN controller replicas. The answer correctly identifies that running a consistency protocol (a) and partitioning the network (d) are effective ways to maintain consistency. It also provides valid reasons for why the other options are not ideal, such as the limitations of keeping a hot spare or subset of state, and the added complexity of resolving conflicts on the routers themselves.

32,"Which property guarantees that each RCP replica continues to install correct forwarding state in the network data plane, even in the case of a partition in the data plane?","a. Each controller has a complete view of the portion of the network that it is controlling, and therefore can guarantee consistent routing within that partition.
b. The controller cannot see many of the routers in the network anyway, so there is no way for it to install incorrect routing state in the routers that it is not connected to.
c. The controllers are partitioned from the network routers, and the routers will fall back to running a distributed routing protocol.
d. Running the network from a single high-level control plane guarantees that network partitions and loops never occur in the first place.

This allows the controller to guarantee consistent routing within its partition, even if it is disconnected from other controllers or parts of the network. The controller can continue to install correct forwarding state in the routers it has visibility of and control over.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is incorrect. In the case of a partition in the data plane, each controller does not necessarily have a complete view of the portion of the network it is controlling. If the data plane is partitioned, the controller may lose visibility and control over some of the routers in its domain. Without a complete view, the controller cannot guarantee consistent routing within its partition.

Furthermore, the question is asking about a property that guarantees each RCP replica continues to install correct forwarding state, even in the case of a data plane partition. None of the answer choices directly address this specific property.

Correct Answer: c. If there is a partition in the data plane, the controllers will be disconnected from some of the network routers. In this case, the routers that are partitioned from the controllers will fall back to running a distributed routing protocol amongst themselves. This allows them to maintain correct forwarding state independently of the controllers until the partition is resolved.",1,0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.0
