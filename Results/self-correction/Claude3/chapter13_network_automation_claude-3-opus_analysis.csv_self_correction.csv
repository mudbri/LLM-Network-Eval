218,Which of the following configuration management tools uses agentless architecture for managing network devices?,"a. Ansible
b. Puppet
c. Chef
d. Ansible and Puppet
e. Puppet and Chef
",a,a,a,Ansible uses an agentless architecture for managing network devices. It connects to devices over SSH or API and does not require any agent software to be installed on the managed nodes. Puppet and Chef both use an agent-based architecture where an agent is installed on each managed node to communicate with the central server.,"Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. Ansible is known for its agentless architecture, which allows it to manage network devices without requiring any agent software to be installed on the managed nodes. Ansible communicates with the devices using protocols like SSH or APIs. In contrast, both Puppet and Chef rely on agent-based architectures, where an agent is installed on each managed node to facilitate communication with the central server.

221,A Layer 2 switch examines a frameâ€™s destination MAC address and forwards that frame out of the port G0/2. That action occurs as part of which plane of the switch?,"a. Data plane
b. Management plane
c. Control Plane
d. None of the above
",a,a,a,"The data plane of a switch is responsible for forwarding frames based on the destination MAC address. When a switch receives a frame, it examines the frame's destination MAC address and looks up the corresponding port in its MAC address table. It then forwards the frame out of that port. This process of frame forwarding based on the destination MAC address occurs in the data plane of the switch.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The data plane of a switch is indeed responsible for forwarding frames based on the destination MAC address. The switch examines the frame's destination MAC address, consults its MAC address table to determine the appropriate outgoing port, and forwards the frame out of that port. This process of frame forwarding based on the MAC address occurs in the data plane of the switch.

224,Which of the following features of Cisco DNA Center discovers the actual path the packets will take from the source to the destination based on the current forwarding tables?,"a. Encrypted traffic analysis
b. Device 360 and Client 360
c. Network time travel
d. Path trace",d,d,d,Path trace is the feature in Cisco DNA Center that discovers the actual path packets will take from source to destination based on the current forwarding tables. It allows network administrators to visualize and troubleshoot the exact route data will follow through the network at a given point in time.,"Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. Path trace is indeed the Cisco DNA Center feature that discovers the actual path packets will take from source to destination based on the current forwarding tables in the network devices. It provides a powerful tool for network administrators to visualize and troubleshoot the precise route that data packets will traverse through the network infrastructure at a specific moment.

The other options mentioned are also features of Cisco DNA Center but do not directly relate to discovering packet paths:

a. Encrypted traffic analysis - Allows visibility into encrypted traffic patterns without decryption.
b. Device 360 and Client 360 - Provides detailed information about network devices and clients.  
c. Network time travel - Enables viewing of network status and events at a past point in time.

So the key feature that matches the question description is path trace.

225,Which of the following features of Cisco DNA Center shows past client performance in a timeline for comparison to current behavior?,"a. Encrypted traffic analysis
b. Device 360 and Client 360
c. Network time travel
d. Path trace",c,c,c,Network time travel is a feature of Cisco DNA Center that allows viewing past client performance in a timeline for comparison to current behavior. It provides historical data and insights into client and network performance over time.,"Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. Network Time Travel is a feature in Cisco DNA Center that allows network administrators to view historical data and insights about client and network performance over time. It enables comparing past client performance to current behavior using a timeline view.

While the other options mentioned are also features or capabilities of Cisco DNA Center, they do not specifically allow viewing past client performance in a timeline for behavior comparison:

a. Encrypted Traffic Analytics (ETA) provides visibility into encrypted traffic for security monitoring, but does not show historical client performance timelines.

b. Device 360 and Client 360 provide detailed current information about specific network devices and clients, but do not include historical timeline comparisons. 

d. Path Trace allows tracing of application paths for connectivity troubleshooting, but is not used to analyze past vs current client behavior.

Therefore, ""Network Time Travel"" is the feature that best matches the capability described in the question.

228,"Your company decides to move away from manual configuration methods, making changes by editing centralized configuration files. The issues you are facing with non-centralized configuration files are:
1) You donâ€™t know who engineer made the changes in the configuration file.
2) You donâ€™t know the changes in the configuration file over time.
Which tool your company will use in order to solve these issues?","a. Version Control System
b. Version Control Configuration
c. Version Control Change
d. Version Control Edit
",a,a,a,"A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that helps manage changes to files over time. It allows multiple users to collaborate on the same set of files, tracking who made what changes and when. VCS also maintains a history of all changes, allowing you to see how the files have evolved. By using a VCS for managing configuration files, your company can address the issues of not knowing who made changes and not having visibility into the changes over time.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation for why a Version Control System (VCS) is the appropriate tool to address the issues described in the question. The answer correctly identifies that a VCS allows tracking of who made changes to files and maintains a history of those changes over time. This directly addresses the two main issues mentioned in the question.

229,"One of the benefits of controller-based networks over traditional networks is that the configuration on the devices have fewer errors, and you spent less time troubleshooting the network.","a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",a,a,a,"The statement is true. In controller-based networks, the centralized controller manages and automates the configuration of network devices. This reduces the likelihood of manual configuration errors compared to traditional networks where each device is configured individually. As a result, network administrators spend less time troubleshooting configuration-related issues in controller-based networks.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. Controller-based networks, such as those using software-defined networking (SDN) principles, centralize the network control plane and automate device configuration through the controller. This approach reduces the chances of human error during device configuration compared to traditional networks, where each device is configured manually. Consequently, network administrators spend less time identifying and resolving misconfigurations and inconsistencies in controller-based networks.

230,The ______________________ plane includes protocols that allow network engineers to manage the devices.,"a. Management
b. Data
c. Control
d. Network
",a,a,a,"The management plane includes protocols and tools that allow network engineers and administrators to configure, monitor, and manage network devices. It deals with the administrative functions of the network devices. The data plane handles the actual forwarding of data packets. The control plane is responsible for making decisions on how to handle network traffic. The network plane is not a standard term used in this context.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation. It accurately identifies that the management plane is the term used to describe the protocols and tools that allow network engineers to manage network devices. The answer also correctly distinguishes the management plane from the data plane (which forwards packets) and the control plane (which makes traffic handling decisions). Finally, it notes that ""network plane"" is not a standard term in this context.
