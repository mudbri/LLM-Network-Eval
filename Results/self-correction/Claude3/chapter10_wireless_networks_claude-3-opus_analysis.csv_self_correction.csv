179,"When APs are placed at different geographic locations, they can all be interconnected by a switched infrastructure. The 802.11 standard calls this an extended service set (ESS).","a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",a,a,a,"The statement is true. When access points (APs) are placed at different geographic locations, they can be interconnected by a switched infrastructure to form an extended service set (ESS). An ESS is a set of one or more interconnected basic service sets (BSSs) and integrated local area networks (LANs) that appear as a single BSS to the logical link control layer at any station associated with one of those BSSs. This allows users to roam between APs while maintaining a seamless connection.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The explanation provided accurately describes how access points placed at different geographic locations can be interconnected by a switched infrastructure to form an extended service set (ESS). It also correctly mentions that an ESS allows users to roam between APs while maintaining a seamless connection.

180,A lightweight access point in which one of the following architectures participate?,"a. Light-MAC
b. Tunnel-MAC
c. Big-MAC
d. Split-MAC
",d,d,d,"A lightweight access point participates in a split-MAC architecture. In this architecture, some of the MAC layer functionalities are handled by the access point itself, while others are handled by a central wireless LAN controller (WLC). This allows for centralized management and configuration of the wireless network.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. In a lightweight access point architecture, the access point participates in a split-MAC design where some MAC layer functions are performed by the AP while others are handled by a centralized wireless LAN controller (WLC). This allows the AP to be simpler and ""lightweight"" compared to autonomous APs that handle all MAC processing themselves. The split-MAC architecture enables centralized management, policy enforcement, and other benefits in larger enterprise wireless networks.

181,Which of the following controller ports is used to connect to a peer controller for high availability (HA) operation?,"a. Service port
b. Distribution system port
c. Redundancy port
d. Console port
",c,c,c,"The redundancy port on a wireless LAN controller is used to connect to a peer controller for high availability (HA) operation. This dedicated port allows the active and standby controllers to synchronize their configurations and maintain a heartbeat. If the active controller fails, the standby controller connected via the redundancy port takes over to minimize downtime.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The redundancy port is indeed used to connect peer wireless LAN controllers for high availability (HA). It allows the active and standby controllers to synchronize their configuration and state information. In the event of a failure of the active controller, the standby controller can take over operations seamlessly using the data obtained via the redundancy port connection.

182,Which of the following wireless security tools is used to protect the integrity of data in a wireless frame?,"a. MIC
b. WIPS
c. WEP
d. EAP
",a,a,a,"MIC (Message Integrity Check) is a wireless security tool used to protect the integrity of data in a wireless frame. It is a checksum calculated over the data payload and header fields of a wireless frame, appended to the frame before encryption. The receiving device recalculates the MIC and compares it to the received MIC to ensure the frame was not altered in transit.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. MIC (Message Integrity Check) is indeed the wireless security tool used to protect the integrity of data in a wireless frame. The explanation provided is accurate, describing how MIC works by calculating a checksum over the data payload and header fields, appending it to the frame before encryption, and then having the receiving device recalculate and compare the MIC to detect any alterations.

The other options are not directly related to protecting data integrity in wireless frames:
- WIPS (Wireless Intrusion Prevention System) is used to monitor, detect, and prevent unauthorized access or attacks on a wireless network.
- WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is an outdated security protocol for wireless networks that has known vulnerabilities.
- EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) is an authentication framework used in wireless networks to provide secure authentication methods.

184,Which of the following bridges can be used to provide wireless connectivity to a non-wireless device?,"a. Wireless repeater
b. Workgroup bridge
c. Transparent bridge
d. Adaptive bridge
",b,b,b,"A workgroup bridge can be used to provide wireless connectivity to a device that does not have built-in wireless capability. It connects to the non-wireless device via Ethernet and then wirelessly bridges the traffic to a wireless access point, allowing the non-wireless device to participate in the wireless network.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. A workgroup bridge is specifically designed to provide wireless connectivity to devices that lack built-in wireless capability. It acts as a bridge between the wired Ethernet connection of the non-wireless device and the wireless network, enabling the device to communicate wirelessly through the bridge.

The other options are not suitable for this purpose:
a. A wireless repeater is used to extend the range of a wireless network by retransmitting the signal, but it does not provide wireless connectivity to non-wireless devices.
c. A transparent bridge is used to connect two network segments at the data link layer, but it does not specifically provide wireless connectivity to non-wireless devices.
d. An adaptive bridge is not a commonly used term in the context of wireless networking.

185,Which controller interface type maps a WLAN to a VLAN?,"a. Management interface
b. Redundancy management
c. Virtual interface
d. Service port interface
e. Dynamic interface
",e,e,e,"A dynamic interface on a Cisco wireless LAN controller maps a WLAN to a VLAN. It is used to route between VLANs and handle dynamic VLAN assignments for wireless clients. The other interfaces mentioned, like management, redundancy, virtual, and service port, serve different purposes and do not directly map WLANs to VLANs.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. A dynamic interface on a Cisco wireless LAN controller is used to map a WLAN to a VLAN. It enables routing between the VLAN associated with the WLAN and other VLANs configured on the controller. The dynamic interface handles dynamic VLAN assignments for wireless clients based on their authentication or other criteria.

The other interface types mentioned serve different purposes:
- Management interface: Used for out-of-band management of the controller.
- Redundancy management: Used for redundancy and high availability between controllers.
- Virtual interface: Used as a gateway for wireless clients when the controller is operating in Layer 3 mode.
- Service port interface: A physical port on the controller used for out-of-band management or network services.

None of these interfaces directly map a WLAN to a VLAN like the dynamic interface does.

186,Which is the most preferred and secure way of connecting to a WLC GUI to configure a new WLAN?,"a. SSH
b. HTTP
c. HTTPS
d. FTP
e. None of the above
",c,c,c,"HTTPS is the most preferred and secure way of connecting to a WLC GUI to configure a new WLAN. HTTPS provides encryption for the communication between the client and the WLC, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the configuration data. SSH is secure but is used for CLI access, not GUI. HTTP is insecure as it sends data in plain text. FTP is a file transfer protocol and not used for WLC configuration.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct and provides a good explanation. HTTPS is indeed the most secure and preferred method for connecting to a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) GUI to configure a new WLAN. The answer correctly points out that HTTPS provides encryption to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the configuration data. It also accurately notes that while SSH is secure, it is used for CLI access rather than GUI, and that HTTP is insecure due to sending data in plain text. Finally, it correctly states that FTP is a file transfer protocol not used for WLC configuration.
