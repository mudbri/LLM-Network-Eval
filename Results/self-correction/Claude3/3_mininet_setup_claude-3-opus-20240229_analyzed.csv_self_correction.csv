16,Which of the following command is used to generate an OpenFlow network topology consisting of a single switch and 8 hosts with randomly generated MAC addresses for each host?,"a. sudo mn --topo single,8  --switch ovsk --controller remote
b. sudo mn --topo single,3 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
c. sudo mn --topo single,8 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
d. sudo mn --topo linear,8  --switch ovsk --controller remote",a,c,c,"The correct command to generate an OpenFlow network topology with a single switch and 8 hosts, each with randomly generated MAC addresses, is: sudo mn --topo single,8 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote. The '--topo single,8' option specifies a single switch with 8 hosts, the '--mac' option enables random MAC address assignment for each host, '--switch ovsk' sets the switch type to Open vSwitch, and '--controller remote' configures the network to use a remote controller.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The command ""sudo mn --topo single,8 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote"" will indeed generate an OpenFlow network topology consisting of a single switch and 8 hosts, with randomly generated MAC addresses for each host. The explanation provided is accurate and covers all the important aspects of the command.

Let's break down the command:
- ""sudo mn"": This runs the Mininet network emulator with superuser privileges.
- ""--topo single,8"": This specifies the topology, which is a single switch connected to 8 hosts.
- ""--mac"": This option enables the random generation of MAC addresses for each host.
- ""--switch ovsk"": This sets the switch type to Open vSwitch (OVS), which is a software-based OpenFlow switch.
- ""--controller remote"": This configures the network to use a remote controller, which is typically used in OpenFlow networks to manage the switches.

The other options in the multiple-choice question are incorrect because:
- Option a: It is missing the ""--mac"" option, which is required to generate random MAC addresses for the hosts.
- Option b: It specifies 3 hosts instead of 8.
- Option d: It uses a linear topology instead of a single switch topology.

17,What is the purpose of --mac flag used in mininet?,"a. Generates random MAC addresses for the hosts.
b. Generates sequential MAC addresses for the hosts, matching their IP address.
c. Generates sequential MAC addresses for the switch ports, matching their IP address.
d. Generates random MAC addresses for the switch ports.
",b,b,b,"The --mac flag in Mininet is used to generate sequential MAC addresses for the hosts, matching their IP addresses. This means that the host MAC addresses will be derived from the IP addresses assigned to them, making it easier to identify and map the MAC to IP for each host in the emulated network.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The --mac flag in Mininet is indeed used to generate sequential MAC addresses for the hosts that match their assigned IP addresses. This flag helps in creating a logical and organized mapping between the IP and MAC addresses of the emulated hosts, making it easier to identify and troubleshoot the network.

20,"What is the purpose of dpctl, provided with mininet?","a. To enable visibility and control over a single switchâ€™s flow table.
b. To enable visibility and control over multiple switch flow table.
c. Is an OpenFlow controller.
",a,a,a,"The purpose of dpctl, provided with Mininet, is to enable visibility and control over a single switch's flow table. It allows you to view and modify the flow entries in an OpenFlow switch's flow table, but only for one switch at a time. It is not used for controlling multiple switches simultaneously, nor is it an OpenFlow controller itself.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The dpctl utility provided with Mininet is indeed used to enable visibility and control over a single switch's flow table. It allows you to view, add, modify, or delete flow entries in the flow table of an individual OpenFlow switch. It is a command-line tool specifically designed to interact with a single switch at a time.
