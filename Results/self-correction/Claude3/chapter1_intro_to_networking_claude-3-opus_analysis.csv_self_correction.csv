6,The host sends packets to its default gateway if the ____________ IP address is in a different subnet than the host.,"a. Source
b. Destination
c. Unicast
d. Broadcast
",b,b,b,"The host sends packets to its default gateway if the destination IP address is in a different subnet than the host. When a host needs to communicate with another device on a different network, it forwards the packets to its default gateway, which then routes the packets to the appropriate destination network.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. When a host needs to send a packet to an IP address that is not on the same local subnet, it forwards the packet to its default gateway. The default gateway is responsible for routing the packet to the appropriate destination network. The host determines whether the destination IP is on the same subnet by comparing the destination IP address with its own IP address and subnet mask. If they are not on the same subnet, the host sends the packet to the default gateway.
