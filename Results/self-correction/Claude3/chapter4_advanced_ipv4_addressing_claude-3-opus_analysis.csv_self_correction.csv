A /30 subnet mask indicates that 30 bits are used for the network portion of the address, leaving 2 bits for host addresses. This allows for 4 total addresses, with 2 usable host addresses (the first and last are reserved for the network and broadcast addresses). The binary representation of 255.255.255.252 is 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111100, matching the 30 network bits.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The provided explanation accurately describes why 255.255.255.252 is the dotted decimal notation (DDN) equivalent of the /30 subnet mask.

The key points are:
1. A /30 subnet mask indicates that 30 bits are used for the network portion, leaving 2 bits for host addresses.
2. This allows for 4 total addresses, with 2 usable host addresses (the first and last are reserved for the network and broadcast addresses).
3. The binary representation of 255.255.255.252 is 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111100, which matches the 30 network bits.

d. 255.255.192.0",d,d,d,"The dotted-decimal notation (DDN) equivalent of /18 is 255.255.192.0. In IPv4 networking, /18 represents a subnet mask where the first 18 bits are set to 1, and the remaining 14 bits are set to 0. When converted to DDN, this translates to 11111111.11111111.11000000.00000000, which is equivalent to 255.255.192.0.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The dotted-decimal notation (DDN) equivalent of the subnet mask /18 is indeed 255.255.192.0.

In IPv4 addressing, the subnet mask /18 indicates that the first 18 bits of the 32-bit address are used for the network portion, while the remaining 14 bits are used for the host portion. When converted to binary, the /18 subnet mask is represented as:

11111111.11111111.11000000.00000000

Each octet (8 bits) in the binary representation can be converted to its decimal equivalent:

11111111 = 255
11111111 = 255
11000000 = 192
00000000 = 0

Therefore, the DDN equivalent of the /18 subnet mask is 255.255.192.0, which matches the answer provided in option d.

A /19 mask (choice c) borrows 3 bits from the host portion, providing 11 subnet bits in total, which is more than enough. The 255.255.224.0 mask (choice f) is equivalent to /19, as it has 11 network bits set to 1 in the third octet (11100000 in binary). The other masks either borrow too few bits to support 90 subnets (/24, /21, and 255.255.240.0) or are invalid for a Class B network (255.255.255.252).","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. Both choices c (/19) and f (255.255.224.0) provide enough subnet bits to support 90 subnets in a Class B network.

A Class B network has a default subnet mask of /16 or 255.255.0.0, which means that the first two octets are used for the network portion, and the last two octets are used for the host portion. To support 90 subnets, we need at least 7 subnet bits (2^7 = 128, which is greater than 90).

Choice c (/19) borrows 3 bits from the host portion, providing 11 subnet bits in total (8 from the third octet and 3 from the fourth octet). This is more than enough to support 90 subnets.

Choice f (255.255.224.0) is equivalent to /19, as it has 11 network bits set to 1 in the third octet (11100000 in binary), which also provides 11 subnet bits.

The other choices are either insufficient or invalid:
- Choice a (/24) only borrows 8 bits from the host portion, which is not enough to support 90 subnets.
- Choice b (/21) borrows 5 bits from the host portion, which can support up to 32 subnets (2^5), which is insufficient.
- Choice d (255.255.255.252) is not a valid subnet mask for a Class B network, as it would leave only 2 bits for host addresses.
- Choice e (255.255.240.0) borrows 4 bits from the host portion, which can support up to 16 subnets (2^4), which is insufficient.
