194,"Examine the following show command output on a router configured for dynamic NAT:
""â€” Inside Source
access-list 1 pool examsdigest
pool examsdigest: netmask 255.255.255.240
start 190.1.1.1 end 190.1.1.10
type generic, total addresses 10, allocated 10 (100%), misses 595""
You are responsible to find out why users are not being able to reach the Internet.","a. The cause is not related to dynamic NAT
b. The command output does not provide any clue to identify the problem
c. Dynamic NAT can't use Standard ACLs
d. The NAT pool does not have enough entries to fulfill the user's requests
",d,d,d,"The output shows that the NAT pool named 'examsdigest' has a total of 10 addresses available for dynamic NAT translation (from 190.1.1.1 to 190.1.1.10). It also indicates that all 10 addresses are allocated (100%). Additionally, there are 'misses' reported, which signifies that there have been 595 instances where an internal device tried to access an external network but could not be allocated an address from the NAT pool because the pool is fully utilized. This suggests that the NAT pool does not have enough addresses to accommodate all the requests from the users trying to reach the Internet.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer correctly identifies the issue based on the provided show command output. The output indicates that the NAT pool is fully utilized, with all 10 addresses being allocated, and there have been 595 misses, which means there were additional requests for NAT translations that could not be fulfilled due to the lack of available addresses in the pool. The answer's rationale is consistent with the information given in the question and accurately reflects a common problem encountered with dynamic NAT configurations when the address pool is too small.

195,"Log messages may tell you about some events, either critical or not. To help you make sense of the importance of each message, IOS assigns each message a severity level. Which of the following severity level means Warning - Warning condition?","a. 2
b. 3
c. 4
d. 5",c,c,c,"In the Cisco IOS logging system, severity levels are defined from 0 (emergencies) to 7 (debugging). A severity level of 4 corresponds to 'Warning' which indicates a warning condition. This is not as severe as levels 0-3, which represent emergencies, alerts, critical, and error conditions respectively, but it is more serious than levels 5-7, which correspond to notification, informational, and debugging messages.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. In the Cisco IOS logging system, severity levels are indeed defined from 0 to 7, with 0 being the most severe (emergencies) and 7 being the least severe (debugging). A severity level of 4 is categorized as 'Warning', which is used to indicate a condition that may not be immediately harmful but could potentially cause issues if not addressed.

196,"Log messages may tell you about some events, either critical or not. To help you make sense of the importance of each message, IOS assigns each message a severity level. Which of the following severity level means Informational: Informational message only?","a. 1
b. 6
c. 4
d. 5",b,b,b,"In Cisco IOS, log messages are classified by severity levels, from 0 (emergencies) to 7 (debugging). Severity level 6 is assigned to 'Informational' messages, which indicate a non-critical condition that merely provides information.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. Cisco IOS indeed uses a numerical system to classify log messages by severity, ranging from 0 (emergencies) to 7 (debugging). Level 6 is indeed used for 'Informational' messages, which are non-critical messages that provide information about the normal operations of a device.

198,One of the features of SNMPv3 is called message integrity.,"a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",a,a,a,"SNMPv3 (Simple Network Management Protocol version 3) includes several features that were not available in earlier versions of SNMP. One of these features is message integrity, which ensures that a packet has not been tampered with in transit. This is accomplished through the use of cryptographic checksums.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. SNMPv3 indeed includes message integrity as one of its features. Message integrity ensures that the message has not been altered or tampered with during transit, and this is typically achieved using cryptographic mechanisms such as hashing functions. This feature is part of the security enhancements introduced in SNMPv3 to address the limitations of SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 in terms of authentication and privacy.

199,You have been tasked to find out whether the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is enabled globally. Which command will you type?,"a. show protocols
b. show cdp
c. show running-config
d. show interface brief
",b,c,c,"The 'show running-config' command is used to display the current configuration of the router, including whether CDP is enabled globally. CDP is usually enabled by default on Cisco devices, and this command will show all the current settings that are actively configured on the device, including CDP settings.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The 'show running-config' command on a Cisco device will display the current operating configuration, including the status of CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol). If CDP is enabled or disabled globally, this will be reflected in the output of the 'show running-config' command. The other options do not specifically provide information about the global status of CDP:
- 'show protocols' may display the status of protocols but does not specifically focus on CDP.
- 'show cdp' would typically be used with additional arguments to show specific CDP information, such as neighbors, but not necessarily the global CDP status.
- 'show interface brief' provides a summary of interface status and does not include protocol-specific configuration like CDP.

200,Which of the following protocols synchronize the time of different systems?,"a. NTP
b. SMTP
c. UDP
d. CDP
",a,a,a,"NTP, which stands for Network Time Protocol, is used to synchronize the clocks of computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks. It is designed to synchronize the time of systems to within a few milliseconds of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). SMTP is the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, used for email transmission. UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol, which is a communication protocol used across the Internet for especially time-sensitive transmissions such as video playback or DNS lookups, but it does not synchronize time. CDP, or Cisco Discovery Protocol, is a proprietary protocol designed by Cisco to help administrators collect information about both locally attached and remote devices, but it does not have a role in time synchronization.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. NTP (Network Time Protocol) is indeed the protocol used to synchronize the time of different systems. The explanation provided for each of the protocols is accurate and helps to clarify why the other options (SMTP, UDP, CDP) are not used for time synchronization.

201,"R1 and R2 are attached to the same Ethernet VLAN, with subnet 192.168.1.0/24, and addresses 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2 respectively. The routers use an FHRP. Host A and host B attach to the same LAN and have correct default router settings per the FHRP configuration. Which of the following statements is true for this LAN?","a. You can't connect two routers to the same LAN subnet.
b. If one router fails, hosts can't send packets off-subnet
c. If one router fails, both hosts will use the one remaining router as a default router
d. if one router fails, only one of the two hosts will still be able to send packets off-subnet
",c,c,c,"First Hop Redundancy Protocols (FHRPs) like HSRP, VRRP, or GLBP allow multiple routers to work together in order to provide redundancy. If one router fails, the other takes over as the active router to continue forwarding traffic, ensuring that the hosts on the LAN still have a way to send packets off-subnet. Since both hosts have correct default router settings per the FHRP configuration, if one router fails, both hosts will use the one remaining router as a default router.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is mostly correct. First Hop Redundancy Protocols (FHRPs) such as HSRP, VRRP, or GLBP indeed enable multiple routers to provide redundancy. If one router were to fail, the other would take over as the active router to continue forwarding traffic, allowing hosts on the LAN to maintain the ability to send packets off-subnet. However, there is a minor error in the IP address details provided in the question. The question states that the addresses are 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.2, but the second address is incomplete and does not conform to the subnet provided (192.168.1.0/24). The second address should be within the same subnet, for example, 192.168.1.2. This error does not affect the correctness of the answer to the question, but it should be corrected for accuracy and clarity.

203,Which of the following characteristics of network traffic can be managed by Quality of Service (QoS)? (Choose all that apply),"a. Bandwidth
b. LLQ
c. Loss
d. Delay
e. CoS
f. Jitter
","a,c,d,f","a,c,d,f","a,c,d,f","Quality of Service (QoS) is a set of technologies and techniques used to manage network traffic and ensure the performance of critical applications. QoS can manage the following characteristics of network traffic: a) Bandwidth: QoS can prioritize certain types of traffic, ensuring they have the necessary bandwidth. c) Loss: QoS can reduce packet loss by prioritizing certain traffic, especially in congested networks. d) Delay: QoS can help in reducing latency for time-sensitive applications like VoIP. f) Jitter: QoS mechanisms can smooth out the arrival time of packets to reduce jitter, which is important for streaming media. While b) LLQ (Low Latency Queueing) and e) CoS (Class of Service) are related to QoS, they are not characteristics of network traffic but rather techniques used within QoS to manage traffic.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer correctly identifies which characteristics of network traffic can be managed by Quality of Service (QoS). The explanation correctly states that QoS can prioritize traffic to ensure necessary bandwidth, reduce packet loss, lower latency, and smooth out packet arrival times to reduce jitter. The answer also correctly points out that LLQ and CoS are related techniques used within QoS rather than characteristics of the network traffic itself.

However, the answer could be slightly misleading where it suggests that LLQ and CoS are not managed by QoS. While LLQ and CoS are indeed techniques or mechanisms within QoS, they are integral parts of how QoS manages network traffic characteristics. LLQ is a feature that helps manage delay and jitter for certain traffic types, and CoS is used to differentiate and manage traffic to control bandwidth, loss, delay, and jitter. Therefore, while they are not characteristics themselves, they are directly related to how QoS manages these characteristics.
