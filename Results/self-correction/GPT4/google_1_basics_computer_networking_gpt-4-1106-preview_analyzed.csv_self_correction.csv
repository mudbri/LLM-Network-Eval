12,What is the difference between full duplex and half duplex?,"a. Half duplex occurs when hubs are in use; full duplex occurs when switches are in use.
b. Full duplex allows communications in two directions at the same time; half duplex means that only one side can communicate at a time.
c. Full duplex is a form of simplex communications.
d. Full duplex is slower than half duplex.
",b,b,b,"Full duplex and half duplex refer to the ability of a communication channel to send and receive data. Full duplex allows for communication in both directions simultaneously, meaning data can be sent and received at the same time. This is commonly used in modern Ethernet networks with switches. On the other hand, half duplex means that the channel can either send or receive data at one time, but not both simultaneously. This is seen in older networks or in walkie-talkie type communication systems. Option 'a' is misleading because the use of hubs or switches doesn't solely determine duplex mode; it's possible for both devices to support either mode depending on their design and configuration. Option 'c' is incorrect because simplex communications involve sending signals in only one direction, which is different from both full and half duplex. Option 'd' is incorrect because full duplex can be faster than half duplex since it allows simultaneous two-way communication, doubling the potential throughput.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer (b) is correct. Full duplex indeed allows for simultaneous two-way communication, whereas half duplex allows for communication in only one direction at a time. The explanation provided is accurate and effectively describes the difference between full duplex and half duplex communication modes.
