32,What are some of the reasons that it is difficult to deploy improvements to BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. Changes are necessarily incremental because of the large installed base of routers that already run BGP.
b. BGP is implemented in hardware, so deploying changes to BGP requires changes on the timescale of hardware development cycles.
c. Deplyoing changes to BGP requires coordination across potentially tens of thousands of ASes in the Internet.
d. Only a few vendors implement BGP, and deploying changes requires convincing those vendors to change the protocol.
e. Deploying changes requires coordination in standards bodies such as the IETF.
","a,c,e","a,c,e","a,c,e","The deployment of improvements to Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is indeed challenging for several reasons. Firstly, BGP has a large installed base of routers, and any changes need to be incremental to ensure compatibility and stability across the network. This is why option (a) is correct. Secondly, changes to BGP require coordination across a vast number of Autonomous Systems (ASes), which makes the process complex and time-consuming, supporting option (c). Lastly, the coordination in standards bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is necessary to ensure that any changes to BGP are standardized and agreed upon by the broader internet community, making option (e) correct. Option (b) is incorrect because BGP is not implemented in hardware; it is a routing protocol that runs on routers, which are generally programmable and can be updated with new software. Option (d) is incorrect because there are more than a few vendors that implement BGP, and convincing them is just one part of the challenge; the actual deployment is more about coordination and compatibility with existing infrastructure.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is mostly accurate in explaining why it is difficult to deploy improvements to BGP. The reasons given for options (a), (c), and (e) being correct are valid. BGP does indeed have a large installed base, and changes must be incremental to avoid disrupting the network (a). Coordination across thousands of ASes is also a significant challenge due to the decentralized nature of the internet (c). Moreover, standards bodies like the IETF play a crucial role in the development and deployment of protocol improvements (e).

However, the explanation for option (b) being incorrect is somewhat misleading. While it is true that BGP is not implemented in hardware and routers are programmable, hardware acceleration and optimization for BGP operations do exist in some network equipment. This can potentially complicate the deployment of changes that affect those optimizations. Nonetheless, the core of the statement is correct; BGP is primarily a software-based protocol, and changes do not necessarily align with hardware development cycles.

Option (d) is also incorrect, but the explanation provided could be expanded. While there are indeed more than a few vendors that implement BGP, the challenge is not merely convincing these vendors. It also involves ensuring that changes do not disrupt interoperability among different vendors' devices and that the vendors have the incentive to implement the changes in a timely manner.

33,Which of the following are true about the RCP? Select all that apply.,"a. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, the RCP controller for an AS sees all routes for all destinations that an AS learns from neighboring ASes.
b. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, there is no need for ASes to use BGP to exchange routes.
c. In an RCP deployment, routers no longer have to compute routes.
d. The RCP controller operates just like a route reflector would, selecting a single best route for each destination for all client routers.
e. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, a single AS can benefit from deploying RCP even if no other ASes deploy RCP.","c,e","a,c,e","a,c,e","The Routing Control Platform (RCP) is a centralized platform that can control routing decisions in a network. Here's an analysis of each choice:

a. True. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, the RCP controller for an Autonomous System (AS) has visibility into all routes for all destinations that the AS learns from neighboring ASes. This comprehensive view allows the RCP to make informed routing decisions.

b. False. Even with RCP, ASes still use BGP to exchange routing information. RCP does not replace BGP but works alongside it to make more centralized routing decisions.

c. True. In an RCP deployment, the computation of routes can be offloaded from individual routers to the RCP controller. Routers still forward traffic but do not need to compute the routes themselves.

d. False. The RCP controller does not operate exactly like a route reflector. While a route reflector selects a single best route for each destination for its clients, the RCP can potentially make more individualized routing decisions for each router based on a wider array of information.

e. True. An AS can benefit from deploying RCP independently of other ASes because the control over its own routing decisions can be improved internally, even if neighboring ASes do not deploy RCP.","Evaluation of original answer:
The answer provided is mostly correct regarding the description of the Routing Control Platform (RCP). Let's evaluate each statement:

a. The statement is correct. In the initial phase of RCP deployment, the RCP controller has visibility into all routes learned from neighboring ASes, which is essential for making centralized routing decisions.

b. This statement was not selected in the original answer, which is correct. RCP does not eliminate the need for BGP; it enhances routing decisions within the AS.

c. The statement is partially correct. While RCP can offload the computation of routes from individual routers, it is important to note that routers may still perform some route computation, especially for intra-AS routing or for fallback purposes if the RCP controller fails. RCP primarily changes the way routes are selected and distributed within the AS.

d. This statement was not selected in the original answer, which is correct. The RCP controller has a broader role than a route reflector, as it can make more granular routing decisions based on a comprehensive view of the network.

e. The statement is correct. An AS can deploy RCP and benefit from centralized control over its routing decisions, regardless of whether other ASes have deployed RCP.

Correct Answers: a, c, e

However, it is important to clarify the role of routers in an RCP deployment regarding statement c. While routers may offload some route computation to the RCP controller, they are still responsible for certain routing functions and must be able to compute routes independently if needed.",0,0,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.6000000000000001
34,"Which of the following are true about network management with BGP, in the absence of RCP? Select all that apply.","a. BGP's interaction with the underlying routing IGP routing protocol can result in persistent forwarding loops.
b. Implementing network-wide policy sometimes causes the routers themeselves to have to carry state.
c. Each router operates and makes decisions based only on a local view of network state.
d. BGP routing has a single point of failure.
e. It is not possible to perform traffic engineering with conventional BGP.
","a,b,c","a,b,c","a,b,c","In the absence of a Routing Control Platform (RCP), traditional BGP management has several characteristics and limitations. Let's evaluate each choice:

a. BGP's interaction with the underlying IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol) can indeed result in persistent forwarding loops. This is because BGP selects routes based on policy and path attributes, without an inherent understanding of the IGP's topology, which can lead to inconsistencies between BGP and IGP routing decisions.

b. When implementing network-wide policies, routers may need to carry additional state to enforce these policies. This is because each router needs to maintain sufficient information to make policy-based routing decisions, which can increase the amount of state held on each router.

c. Each router in a BGP-managed network does indeed operate based on a local view of the network state. BGP routers exchange routing information through BGP updates, but each router's perspective is limited to the information it receives from directly connected neighbors and the policies it has configured.

d. BGP routing does not have a single point of failure as it is a distributed protocol where each router independently constructs its own routing table based on information from its neighbors. This decentralized nature is one of the strengths of BGP.

e. It is possible to perform traffic engineering with conventional BGP, although it may be more complex and less flexible compared to using an RCP or SDN-based approaches. BGP can influence traffic flows through techniques such as manipulating AS path attributes, local preference, and MED values.

Given the analysis, the correct options are a, b, and c.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is mostly correct with thorough explanations for each choice. However, the explanation for choice (a) might be slightly misleading. While it is true that inconsistencies between BGP and IGP decisions can lead to suboptimal routing, persistent forwarding loops are generally avoided due to the inherent loop prevention mechanisms in BGP, such as the AS_PATH attribute. BGP is designed to avoid loops between different autonomous systems. However, if the question implies a scenario where BGP and IGP are not properly synchronized, then temporary loops could occur, but they are not a characteristic feature of BGP's operation.

35,Which of the following is true about the second phase of RCP deployment? Select all that apply.,"a. The second phase of RCP deployment requires no coordination with neighboring ASes.
b. The second phase of RCP deployment offers potential benefits such as reduced routing table size.
c. In the second phase of deployment, the RCP controller sees all routes for every destination that neighboring ASes advertise.
d. The second phase of deployment requires fewer BGP sessions at the RCP controller than the first phase, thus improving scalability of the controller.
e. In the second phase of RCP deployment, ASes do not need to use BGP to exchange routes with one another.
","b,c","b,c",b,"The second phase of Routing Control Platform (RCP) deployment involves the RCP controller having visibility into all routes for every destination that neighboring Autonomous Systems (ASes) advertise, which can lead to potential benefits such as reduced routing table size because the RCP can make more intelligent routing decisions and possibly aggregate routes more effectively. However, it still requires coordination with neighboring ASes because the RCP needs to receive the routing information from them. The number of BGP sessions at the RCP controller in the second phase is not necessarily fewer than in the first phase, as the RCP still needs to maintain full visibility into the network, which requires maintaining BGP sessions with all relevant ASes. Finally, ASes still need to use BGP or another routing protocol to exchange routes with one another; the RCP does not eliminate the need for an inter-AS routing protocol.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer identifies options b and c as correct. While it correctly states that the RCP controller having visibility into all routes can lead to potential benefits such as reduced routing table size (option b), it also includes option c, which might be misleading without additional context. The answer correctly refutes option a, explaining that coordination with neighboring ASes is still required. It also correctly clarifies that the number of BGP sessions at the RCP controller does not necessarily decrease in the second phase (contradicting option d) and that BGP or another routing protocol is still needed for ASes to exchange routes (contradicting option e). However, the answer does not provide a clear stance on whether option c is truly correct or incorrect, and instead, focuses on other aspects of RCP deployment.

Correct Answers: b

Option c is not necessarily true as it depends on the specific implementation and design of the RCP deployment. In some cases, the RCP controller might see all routes for every destination, but this is not inherently true for all second-phase RCP deployments. Therefore, without further context, it is not safe to confirm option c as universally correct. Option b is the only choice that can be confidently stated as true based on the information provided in the evaluation.",1,0,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.6000000000000001
36,"In terms of the parlance of the 4D architecture, which protocol serves as the ""dissemination plane"" for the RCP?","a. External BGP
b. Spanning Tree Protocol
c. The Internal Gateway Protocol (IGP)
d. Internal BGP
e. LLDP
",d,d,d,"The 4D architecture is a concept that separates a network's control functions into four planes: decision, dissemination, discovery, and data. The Routing Control Platform (RCP) is a component of this architecture that makes routing decisions. The dissemination plane is responsible for distributing the decisions made by the RCP to the network devices. In the context of RCP, Internal BGP (iBGP) is used to disseminate routing information within an Autonomous System (AS). External BGP (eBGP) is used between different ASes, while Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) and the Internal Gateway Protocol (IGP) are used for different purposes, such as loop prevention and routing inside an AS, respectively. LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) is used for discovering neighboring devices on a local network segment, not for routing information dissemination.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The 4D architecture, which includes the decision, dissemination, discovery, and data planes, is a network architecture that aims to simplify network control and management. The Routing Control Platform (RCP) is part of this architecture and is responsible for making routing decisions. The dissemination plane's role within the 4D architecture is to distribute these decisions throughout the network. Internal BGP (iBGP) is indeed used for disseminating routing information within an Autonomous System, which aligns with the function of the dissemination plane in the context of RCP. The other protocols listed serve different roles within a network and are not primarily used as a dissemination plane for the RCP. Hence, the answer provided is accurate and well-explained.

b. Inherent robustness of control plane
c. Simpler management systems
d. Faster innovation
e. Simpler routers and switches
","c,d,e","a,b,c,d","a,b,c,d","The 4D architecture for network control proposes four dimensions: decision, dissemination, discovery, and data. The goal of simplifying the control plane in the 4D architecture includes several aspects. Improved security (a) is a goal because a simpler control plane can reduce the attack surface and make it easier to implement and manage security policies. Inherent robustness of the control plane (b) is also a goal since a simpler control plane can lead to fewer errors and more straightforward fault tolerance mechanisms. Simpler management systems (c) are a goal because complexity is often the enemy of management; a simpler control plane can lead to more straightforward management tools and processes. Faster innovation (d) is a goal as well since a simplified control plane can allow for quicker development and deployment of new features and protocols. Simpler routers and switches (e) might be a consequence of a simplified control plane but are not explicitly stated as a goal of the 4D architecture.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer provides a correct assessment of the goals of the 4D architecture regarding the simplification of the control plane. It correctly identifies improved security, inherent robustness, simpler management systems, and faster innovation as goals. The explanation given for each choice is accurate and aligns with the principles of the 4D architecture. However, the answer does not explicitly state whether ""simpler routers and switches"" (e) is a correct choice or not, but it does imply that it is not a primary goal by mentioning it as a possible consequence. To clarify, while simpler routers and switches may result from a simplified control plane, they are not explicitly listed as a goal within the context of the 4D architecture's simplification of the control plane.

38,What are some examples of how a separate decision plane in the 4D architecture can amortize system overhead? Select all that apply.,"a. Maintaining a single table in memory of AS paths that are learned across all BGP sessions in the AS, and using references into that table for specific routers (and routing decisions), to save memory.
b. If secure BGP were deployed, verifying the signatures on the AS paths of routes received from neighbors.
c. Keeping track of topology information.
d. Performing route computation on behalf of all the routers in the AS.
e. Performing inbound traffic engineering on a set of links in a coordinated fashion.
","a,b,c","a,c,d,e","a,c,d,e","The 4D architecture in networking proposes a separation of the network's control plane (decision plane) from the data plane (forwarding plane) and management plane. This architecture can amortize system overhead in several ways. Here's how the given options align with this concept:

a. Maintaining a single table of AS paths across all BGP sessions saves memory by avoiding duplication of this information across multiple routers. This is a clear example of a centralized decision plane reducing overhead.

b. Verifying signatures on AS paths would indeed be a function of a secure BGP deployment, but it is not an example of amortizing system overhead by using a separate decision plane. This process would likely add overhead for security purposes, not reduce it.

c. Keeping track of topology information centrally in the decision plane can reduce the overhead on individual routers, which no longer need to maintain and update their own complete topology information.

d. Performing route computation centrally for all routers in the AS can greatly reduce the computational overhead on individual routers, as they no longer need to perform these computations themselves.

e. Coordinated inbound traffic engineering can optimize the use of network resources and reduce overhead by allowing the decision plane to make more informed and holistic decisions about traffic flows across multiple links.

The options a, c, d, and e are examples of how a separate decision plane can help to amortize system overhead by centralizing functions that would otherwise be duplicated across many routers in the network.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is mostly accurate and aligns well with the principles of the 4D network architecture. The explanation provided for each option correctly identifies whether or not it is an example of amortizing system overhead by using a separate decision plane. However, the explanation for option b could be slightly misleading. While verifying signatures on AS paths is indeed a security function, and not directly an example of reducing system overhead, it is not entirely clear in the explanation that this function would not typically be included in the decision plane of the 4D architecture. Therefore, option b is correctly excluded from the list of correct answers, but the explanation could be clearer in stating that security functions do not inherently reduce system overhead in the context of the decision plane.

d. Ensuring predictable behavior for planned maintenance events
e. Counting the volume of video streaming traffic across a peering link
","a,c,d","a,c,d","a,c,d","The 4D architecture for network control decomposes network control into four planes: decision, dissemination, discovery, and data. The decision plane is responsible for making high-level control decisions based on network-wide objectives. Examples of such objectives include: 

a. Ensuring that connectivity is not interrupted when a link or router fails: This is a network-wide objective that involves rerouting traffic and adapting to changes in the network, which falls under the responsibilities of the decision plane.

c. Balancing traffic load across a network: This is another network-wide objective that optimizes the performance of the network by distributing traffic in a way that avoids congestion and maximizes the utilization of network resources.

d. Ensuring predictable behavior for planned maintenance events: The decision plane can plan and execute changes to the network in a way that minimizes disruptions during maintenance, which is a network-wide objective.

e. Counting the volume of video streaming traffic across a peering link: While this action involves network traffic analysis, it is more of a monitoring task rather than a network-wide objective that the decision plane would achieve. It might inform decision-making but is not an objective itself.

b. Provisioning a BGP peering session to a neighbor AS: This is more of a configuration task that might be informed by the decision plane's policies but is not a network-wide objective. It is more specific to a particular function or protocol rather than an overarching goal of the network.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer correctly identifies a, c, and d as network-wide objectives that the decision plane in the 4D architecture could aim to achieve. The explanations provided for these choices are accurate and align with the functions of the decision plane, which is responsible for making high-level control decisions to ensure the network operates according to the desired policies and objectives.

However, the explanation for choice e is slightly misleading. The original answer states that counting the volume of video streaming traffic across a peering link is more of a monitoring task and not an objective itself. While it is true that traffic analysis and monitoring are not direct objectives, they can inform the decision plane to make better decisions regarding traffic management and network optimization. Thus, the distinction made in the original answer is correct, but the explanation could have been more precise in stating that traffic monitoring supports decision-making rather than being a direct objective.

The explanation for choice b is also correct. Provisioning a BGP peering session is indeed more of a specific configuration task, and while it might be guided by the policies set by the decision plane, it is not a network-wide objective in the context of the 4D architecture's decision plane.
