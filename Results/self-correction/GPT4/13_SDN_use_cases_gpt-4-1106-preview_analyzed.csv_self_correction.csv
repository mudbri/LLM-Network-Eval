95,What are some benefits to using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Host configuration is simpler, since all hosts are visible from a single large Ethernet topology.
b. Forwarding on physical MAC addresses is simpler, since both the data center network topology and hosts' physical MAC addresses are hierarchical.
c. IP routing does not need to be reconfigured when physical or virtual machines move from one part of the network to another.
d. Scaling problems are simpler, since all hosts are configured on a single, flat topology.
e. Load balancing is easier on a layer-2 topology than on a layer 3 topology.","a,c","a,c,d","a,c","Using a layer-2 MAC topology for an entire data center can indeed simplify host configuration (a) because all hosts appear to be on the same local network, thus avoiding the need for complex routing configurations. Additionally, when physical or virtual machines move across the network (c), their IP addresses can remain the same, which means that IP routing does not need to be reconfigured. Scaling problems can also be simpler (d) because a flat topology does not require additional routing protocols or complex network designs to accommodate more hosts. However, forwarding on physical MAC addresses (b) is not necessarily simpler just because the network is layer-2; in fact, large flat networks can lead to issues like broadcast storms and MAC address table overflow, which are not hierarchical by nature. Lastly, load balancing (e) is not inherently easier on a layer-2 topology compared to a layer-3 topology; load balancing can be implemented effectively on both layers, and layer-3 load balancing can take advantage of routing protocols and techniques that are not available at layer-2.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer correctly identifies that host configuration can be simpler in a layer-2 MAC topology (a) and that IP routing does not need to be reconfigured when machines move (c). However, the original answer's assertion that scaling problems are simpler in a single, flat topology (d) is not entirely accurate. While a flat layer-2 network might initially be simpler to configure, it can lead to scalability issues such as broadcast storms and large ARP tables as the network grows. Therefore, scalability is often more complex in a large flat layer-2 network.

Additionally, forwarding on physical MAC addresses (b) is not simpler because the addresses are hierarchical; in fact, MAC addresses are flat and not hierarchical, which can complicate forwarding decisions in a large network. Furthermore, the statement that load balancing is easier on a layer-2 topology (e) is misleading because load balancing can be effectively implemented on both layer-2 and layer-3 topologies, and layer-3 load balancing can leverage routing protocols that are not available at layer-2.

96,"In PortLand, what are the reasons for assigning hosts pseudo-MAC addresses, as opposed to simply forwarding traffic on physical MAC addresses? Select all that apply.","a. Hosts in the data-center network topology are more vulnerable to attack if they expose their actual physical MAC addresses, rather than having a layer of indirection.
b. It is very difficult to load balance traffic using physical MAC addresses; pseudo MAC addresses make it possible to assign traffic to destination IP addresses.
c. Without pseudo-MAC addresses, switches would have to update forwarding state whenever hosts with a particular MAC address moved from one portion of the topology to another.
d. Forwarding loops are be more common in a flat layer-2 topology than they are in a topology with hierarchical pseudo MAC addresses.
e. In a flat layer-2 topology, switches cannot know on which port to forward traffic without maintaining switch tables for each MAC address, since MAC addresses are flat, not hierarchical.","c,e","c,e","c,e","PortLand is a scalable fault-tolerant layer 2 data center network structure. The use of pseudo-MAC addresses in PortLand serves several purposes, but let's evaluate the given options:

a. This statement is not one of the primary reasons for using pseudo-MAC addresses in PortLand. The main concern is not the vulnerability of hosts to attack due to exposure of their actual physical MAC addresses.

b. While load balancing is an important aspect of data center operations, the use of pseudo MAC addresses is primarily for ease of management and not specifically for assigning traffic to destination IP addresses based on MAC addresses.

c. This is correct. Pseudo-MAC addresses allow for location-independent addressing. If a host moves, the pseudo-MAC address can remain the same, which means that the switches do not need to update their forwarding state as they would if physical MAC addresses were used. This simplifies the management of the network.

d. Forwarding loops are a concern in network topologies, but the statement is not specifically addressing why PortLand uses pseudo-MAC addresses. PortLand uses a routing protocol to prevent forwarding loops, not just hierarchical MAC addresses.

e. This is correct. In a flat layer-2 network, it is challenging for switches to know where to forward traffic without extensive switch tables for each MAC address. Pseudo-MAC addresses in PortLand are hierarchical, which allows the system to determine the location of a host within the topology and forward traffic efficiently without maintaining large switch tables.

Therefore, the reasons for assigning pseudo-MAC addresses in PortLand are to avoid the need to update forwarding state when hosts move (c) and to facilitate efficient traffic forwarding without maintaining extensive switch tables (e).","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer correctly identifies options c and e as valid reasons for using pseudo-MAC addresses in PortLand. The explanations provided for each option are mostly accurate. However, the explanation for option b could be misleading. While load balancing is not the primary reason for pseudo MAC addresses, it's important to note that pseudo MAC addresses do contribute to the scalability and manageability of the network, which can indirectly support load balancing strategies by simplifying the network architecture. Additionally, the explanation for option a could be expanded to clarify that while security is not the primary reason, indirection can contribute to security practices in general.

97,What are the steps involved in the Proxy ARP process that PortLand's Fabric Manager runs?,"a. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns returns PMAC directly to the end host.
b. Edge switch sends ARP query to fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch updates its local PMAC mapping table.
c. Host sends ARP query, fabric manager intercepts ARP query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to end host.
d. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query, consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to the host.
e. Host sends ARP query, edge switch intercepts query and redirects to the fabric manager, fabric manager consults PMAC mapping table and returns PMAC to edge switch, edge switch returns PMAC to end host.
",e,e,e,"The Proxy ARP process in the context of PortLand's Fabric Manager works as follows: The host sends an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) query when it needs to resolve an IP address to a MAC address. The edge switch, which is part of the PortLand fabric, intercepts this ARP query. Instead of allowing the ARP broadcast to propagate throughout the network, the edge switch redirects the ARP request to the Fabric Manager. The Fabric Manager then consults its PMAC (Pseudo MAC) mapping table to find the corresponding PMAC for the requested IP. Once the Fabric Manager has the PMAC, it sends this information back to the edge switch. The edge switch, in turn, updates its local PMAC mapping table if necessary and then returns the PMAC to the end host. This process reduces ARP broadcast traffic and maintains the location of hosts within the fabric.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer provides a detailed and accurate explanation of the Proxy ARP process in the context of PortLand's Fabric Manager. It correctly identifies the steps involved in the process, which includes the host sending an ARP query, interception by the edge switch, redirection to the Fabric Manager, the Fabric Manager consulting the PMAC mapping table, and the edge switch returning the PMAC to the end host. The answer also correctly identifies the benefits of this process, such as reducing ARP broadcast traffic and maintaining the location of hosts within the fabric.

98,"What are some of the disadvantages of today's interdomain routing protocol, BGP? Select all that apply.","a. ISPs cannot load-balance traffic across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix.
b. Routing and forwarding decisions are only based on IP prefix, not on a broader range of traffic flow attributes.
c. ISPs can only influence route selection through indirect mechanisms (e.g., prepending), rather than directly manipulating the forwarding table entries in switches.
d. ISPs cannot express preference of one route over another, given multiple routes to a destination.
e. ISPs can only influence the routing decisions of their immediate neighbor, not the entire end-to-end path.
","b,c,e","b,c,e","b,c,e","The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the standard interdomain routing protocol used on the Internet today. It does have several limitations and disadvantages, which include the following:

- ISPs can load-balance traffic across multiple routes to the same destination IP prefix, which means choice (a) is incorrect. BGP allows ISPs to implement load balancing using techniques such as ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path).

- Routing and forwarding decisions in BGP are indeed based only on IP prefix and do not consider a broader range of traffic flow attributes (such as application type, user, or other QoS parameters). This makes choice (b) correct.

- ISPs can only influence route selection through indirect mechanisms like AS path prepending, local preference, and MED (Multi-Exit Discriminator) attributes. They cannot directly manipulate the forwarding table entries in switches, which makes choice (c) correct.

- ISPs can express preference of one route over another, given multiple routes to a destination, by using BGP path attributes like local preference, AS path length, and others. Therefore, choice (d) is incorrect.

- ISPs can indeed only influence the routing decisions of their immediate BGP neighbors. They have no direct control over the entire end-to-end path, as BGP is a policy-based routing protocol that allows each autonomous system to make its own independent routing decisions. This makes choice (e) correct.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer provides a clear explanation of the capabilities and limitations of BGP. It correctly identifies that BGP does not consider a broader range of traffic flow attributes (choice b), and that ISPs can only influence route selection through indirect mechanisms (choice c). It also accurately states that ISPs cannot influence the entire end-to-end path (choice e). However, there is a minor error in the explanation for choice (a). While BGP does allow for load balancing, it may not be as straightforward or flexible as the explanation suggests, as load balancing can be limited by BGP's decision process and the available paths. The explanation for choice (d) is correct, as BGP does allow ISPs to express route preferences using various attributes.

101,What are some of the features that an SDX enables that today's IXPs cannot support? Select all that apply.,"a. Application of different business relationships across different regions of the world (e.g., peering only in a specific geographic region).
b. Application-specific peering
c. Wide-area load balancing using DNS-based redirection
d. On-the-fly redirection to middleboxes
e. Wide-area load balancing using IP packet rewriting
","b,d,e","a,b,d,e","a,b,d,e","Software Defined Exchange (SDX) enables more flexible and programmable network management compared to traditional Internet Exchange Points (IXPs). Here are the evaluations for each choice provided:

a. Application of different business relationships across different regions of the world (e.g., peering only in a specific geographic region) - SDXs allow the definition of complex policies that can be applied to traffic based on various criteria, including geographic regions. This is not typically possible with traditional IXPs.

b. Application-specific peering - SDXs enable policies that can be tailored to specific applications, allowing for more granular control over peering decisions based on application types or requirements.

d. On-the-fly redirection to middleboxes - SDXs can dynamically redirect traffic to various services such as firewalls, load balancers, or other middleboxes for processing without the need for manual reconfiguration.

e. Wide-area load balancing using IP packet rewriting - SDXs can perform functions like IP packet rewriting to distribute traffic across multiple sites for load balancing purposes.

As for choice c, 'Wide-area load balancing using DNS-based redirection,' this is a technique that is already possible without the need for an SDX. DNS-based redirection is commonly used for load balancing and is not a unique feature enabled by SDXs.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer provides a detailed explanation for each of the choices, correctly identifying which features an SDX can support that traditional IXPs cannot. It accurately points out that SDXs offer more flexible and programmable network management, allowing for geographic-specific peering, application-specific peering, on-the-fly redirection to middleboxes, and IP packet rewriting for load balancing. The answer also correctly identifies that DNS-based redirection is not unique to SDXs and is a technique that can be implemented without the need for an SDX. The original answer is largely correct, but it should be noted that while DNS-based redirection is not unique to SDXs, SDXs might still support it as part of their overall feature set.

103,What are some of the motivations for applying software defined networking in home networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Better performance, since control decisions can be made from a well-provisioned server, as opposed to an under-provisioned router.
b. Ability to better user interfaces to control home network behavior, independent of the interfaces that ship with home router devices.
c. Ability to allow multiple service providers access to the home network infrastructure for different applications and services.
d. Outsourcing control and management of the home network to a third party.
e. More fine-grained control over the forwarding behavior of individual devices as conditions in the network change (e.g., a device uses too much bandwidth or data).
","b,c,d,e","a,b,c,e","a,b,c,d,e","Software Defined Networking (SDN) brings several benefits to home networks. Here's an evaluation of each choice given the context of SDN in home networks:

a. Better performance is a motivation because SDN allows for centralizing the control decisions, which can be made from a more powerful server instead of relying on less capable home routers.

b. SDN can provide more user-friendly and customizable interfaces for managing home networks, independent of the default interfaces provided by router manufacturers.

c. SDN enables the home network infrastructure to be programmatically controlled, which can allow multiple service providers to offer various applications and services using the same physical network.

d. While outsourcing control and management of the home network to a third party could be a use case for SDN, it is not a primary motivation for applying SDN in home networks. The focus of SDN is more on the flexibility and programmability of the network rather than on who manages it.

e. SDN allows for fine-grained control over network devices, enabling dynamic adjustments to the network's forwarding behavior based on changing conditions, such as a device consuming excessive bandwidth.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer correctly identifies motivations for applying software-defined networking (SDN) in home networks. Each point is well explained and aligns with the benefits that SDN can provide. However, the evaluation of option d could be slightly misleading. While it is true that outsourcing control and management to a third party is not a primary motivation, it can still be a significant benefit and motivation for some users who prefer to have a managed service. Therefore, while not the primary motivation, it should not be completely dismissed as a potential benefit.

104,"Suppose that an operator of a home network wants to write the following policy:
1. Block all traffic to Facebook from my child's computer.
2. Rate limit BitTorrent traffic from my child's computer if the VoIP client on my desktop is active.
Which of the following most closely approximates the policy?  Assume that ""facebook"" represents Facebook IP addresses, that ""bittorrent"" represents BitTorrent ports, and that ""limitifVOIP"" is a dynamic policy that checks a Resonance-like state machine to determine whether VOIP traffic has recently been observed.","a. (match(srcip=child, dstip=facebook) + drop) + (match(srcip=child, dstport=bittorrent) + dynamic(limitIfVOIP))
b. (match(srcip=child, dstip=facebook) >> drop) >> (match(srcip=child, dstport=bittorrent) >> dynamic(limitIfVOIP))
c. (match(srcip=child, dstip=facebook) >> drop) + (match(srcip=child, dstport=bittorrent) >> dynamic(limitIfVOIP))
d. (match(srcip=child, dstip=facebook) + drop) >> (match(srcip=child, dstport=bittorrent) + dynamic(limitIfVOIP))
",c,c,b,"The policy described requires two distinct rules: one to block traffic to Facebook, and another to rate limit BitTorrent traffic conditionally based on VoIP activity. In the context of a policy language for Software Defined Networking (SDN), the '+' operator typically denotes a conjunction of conditions or actions, while the '>>' operator implies a sequence or pipeline of match-action pairs. Therefore, we need to combine the two policies using '+', since they are independent and should be applied concurrently, not sequentially. The correct policy should match the child's source IP ('srcip=child') with the destination IP of Facebook ('dstip=facebook') and drop the packets. Concurrently, it should match the child's source IP with the BitTorrent destination ports ('dstport=bittorrent') and apply the dynamic rate limiting policy ('dynamic(limitIfVOIP)') if VoIP traffic is detected. Option 'c' correctly uses the '+' operator to combine the two independent policies and the '>>' operator to link the match conditions with their respective actions, which is the most accurate representation of the desired policy.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer correctly identifies that the policy described requires two distinct rules: one to block traffic to Facebook, and another to rate limit BitTorrent traffic conditionally based on VoIP activity. It also correctly discusses the use of '+' and '>>' operators in the context of SDN policy language, where '+' denotes a conjunction of conditions or actions, and '>>' implies a sequence or pipeline of match-action pairs.

However, the original answer incorrectly concludes that option 'c' is the correct representation of the desired policy. The explanation given does not align with the choice, as option 'c' uses a '+' operator between the two match conditions, which would not represent the concurrent application of policies. Instead, the correct representation would use the '+' operator between the two independent actions (drop and dynamic(limitIfVOIP)) linked to their respective match conditions using the '>>' operator.

Correct Answers: b

The correct policy should use the '>>' operator to link the match conditions with their respective actions, and since the actions are independent and should be applied concurrently, the '>>' operator should be used between the two match-action pairs. Option 'b' correctly represents this with a sequence of match-action pairs for each rule, indicating that if the first condition is met (traffic to Facebook), the action is to drop the packets, and if the second condition is met (BitTorrent traffic), the action is to apply the dynamic rate limiting policy.",1,0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.0
