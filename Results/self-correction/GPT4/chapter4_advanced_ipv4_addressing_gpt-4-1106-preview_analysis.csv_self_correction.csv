Therefore, the subnet ID (network address) is the IP address with the host portion set to 0, which is 20.54.23.0.

It accurately describes how to determine the subnet ID and the broadcast address given an IP address and a subnet mask. The subnet ID is found by setting the host portion of the IP address to all zeros, and the broadcast address is found by setting the host portion to all ones. The explanation correctly applies this to the given IP address and subnet mask, resulting in the correct subnet ID and broadcast address.

The last IP address in the range, 12.5.5.255, is reserved for the broadcast address, and the second to last, 12.5.5.254, would be the highest usable IP address. Counting back from there, the last 100 usable IP addresses would fall between 12.5.5.155 and 12.5.5.254. Therefore, the only IP address from the choices given that could be leased from the last 100 usable IP addresses in this subnet is 12.5.4.254.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer is incorrect. The subnet 12.5.4.0/23 does not encompass the range from 12.5.4.0 to 12.5.5.255 as stated. A /23 subnet has 512 IP addresses. Given the subnet 12.5.4.0/23, the actual range is from 12.5.4.0 to 12.5.5.255, which is correctly stated, but the error is in the conclusion. The last 100 usable IP addresses would indeed be from 12.5.5.156 to 12.5.5.254, not starting from 12.5.5.155, because 12.5.5.155 would be the 101st address from the end.

The block size in the second octet is 32 (256 - 224 from the subnet mask), which means the network increments in the second octet are in multiples of 32. The IP address 10.75.20.3 falls into the subnet range of 10.64.0.0 to 10.79.255.255, since 75 is between 64 (2nd block of 32, 32*2) and 95 (3rd block of 32, 32*3 - 1). Therefore, the broadcast address for this subnet is the last IP in the range, which is 10.79.255.255.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer is correct. The subnet mask 255.248.0.0 corresponds to a /13 prefix, which means the first 13 bits of the IP address are used for network identification. In binary, the subnet mask is 11111111.11111000.00000000.00000000, where the first 13 bits are network bits. The block size in the second octet is indeed 32, which is derived from 256 - 224 (where 224 is the binary representation of 248 in the second octet). The IP address 10.75.20.3 falls within the range of 10.64.0.0 to 10.79.255.255, and thus the broadcast address for this subnet is the last IP in the range, which is 10.79.255.255.

The subnet mask 255.255.192.0 corresponds to the prefix /18. The wildcard mask will be 0.0.63.255. When we apply this to the IP address, we keep the network portion the same (172.30) and for the host portion we replace the corresponding subnet bits with binary 1s.

The original answer is correct. The explanation provided for calculating the broadcast address is accurate. The subnet mask 255.255.192.0 does indeed correspond to a /18 prefix. The wildcard mask is correctly calculated as 0.0.63.255. When applying this wildcard mask to the IP address 172.30.70.26, the network part (172.30) remains unchanged, and the host part is filled with binary 1s for the bits that are 0 in the subnet mask, resulting in the broadcast address 172.30.127.255.

f. 255.255.224.0","a,d","b,e","b,f","In a Class B network, the default subnet mask is 255.255.0.0, which corresponds to a /16 prefix length. To support 90 subnets, we need to determine how many bits are required to represent at least 90 unique values. Using the formula 2^n >= number of subnets (where n is the number of bits), we find that 2^7 = 128, which is the smallest power of 2 greater than 90. Therefore, we need 7 additional bits for subnetting. Adding these 7 bits to the original 16 bits of the Class B network, we get a subnet mask of /23 (16+7=23). However, since the question asks for a mask that can support at least 90 subnets, we can use a /21 or a /22 subnet mask, which provides even more subnets. The corresponding decimal subnet masks for /21 and /22 are 255.255.248.0 and 255.255.240.0, respectively. Option b (/21) and option e (255.255.240.0) are therefore correct. Option d (255.255.255.252) is a /30 mask which is typically used for point-to-point links, and option f (255.255.224.0) is a /19 mask which provides more subnets than required.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer incorrectly states that a /21 and 255.255.240.0 are correct choices for providing at least 90 subnets in a Class B network. The explanation provided is also incorrect because it mentions a /23 mask which is not one of the options and then jumps to stating that /21 and /22 are correct without explaining why /22 is not listed as an option. Additionally, the explanation incorrectly matches the /21 mask with 255.255.248.0 and the /22 mask with 255.255.240.0, which is not accurate.

In a Class B network, the default subnet mask is indeed 255.255.0.0, which corresponds to a /16 prefix length. To support at least 90 subnets, we need to calculate the number of bits required to have at least 90 unique subnet identifiers. As the original answer correctly states, 2^7 = 128, which is sufficient for 90 subnets. Therefore, we need 7 additional bits for subnetting on top of the original 16 bits, leading to a /23 subnet mask (16+7=23).

However, the correct decimal subnet mask for a /21 prefix length is 255.255.248.0, not 255.255.240.0 as stated in the original answer. The correct decimal subnet mask for a /22 prefix length is 255.255.252.0, which is not an option given. The answer also incorrectly includes option e (255.255.240.0), which corresponds to a /20 mask, not a /22 mask.

Correct Answers: b, f

Explanation: Option b (/21) provides up to 2^(32-21) = 2^11 = 2048 subnets, which is more than enough for the required 90 subnets. Option f (255.255.224.0) corresponds to a /19 mask, which provides up to 2^(32-19) = 2^13 = 8192 subnets, again more than enough for the required 90 subnets.

Since the IP address is a Class A address (starting with 10), it has 8 network bits by default.
