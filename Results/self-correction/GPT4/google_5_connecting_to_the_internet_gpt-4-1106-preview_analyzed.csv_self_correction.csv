72,A baud rate is a measurement of the number of ______________________.,"a. bits that can be sent across a telephone line every minute
b. bytes that can be sent across a telephone line every second
c. bits that can be sent across a telephone line every second
d. bytes that can be sent across a telephone line every minute
",c,c,c,"Baud rate is a measure of how many signal changes or symbols are transmitted per second. It is often used interchangeably with bits per second, although they are not technically the same. Baud rate specifically refers to the number of signal units per second. In many cases, one baud equals one bit, but this is not always the case, as some modulation techniques can encode more than one bit per baud. Therefore, the closest answer from the given options is 'c', which refers to the number of bits that can be sent across a telephone line every second.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer contains a common misconception. While it is true that baud rate is often used interchangeably with bits per second, they are not the same. Baud rate refers to the number of signal changes (modulation events) that occur per second, not the number of bits. However, the explanation does correctly identify this distinction and acknowledges that one baud does not always equal one bit. Given the provided options and the typical use of the term ""baud rate"" in a non-technical context, the chosen answer 'c' is acceptable, although it would be more accurate to say that baud rate refers to the number of signal changes or symbols per second, not strictly bits.

Correct Answers: (No correct answer provided as none of the options accurately describe baud rate. However, 'c' is the closest approximation given the common usage of the term in place of bits per second.)",1,0,5_connecting_to_the_internet,1.0

75,Modems take data that computers can understand and turn them into _____ that can be transmitted over POTS.,"a. Audible wavelengths
b. Baud rates
c. Modulating electrical charges
d. PSTN
",a,a,a,"Modems (short for modulator-demodulator) are devices that convert digital data from a computer into a format suitable for transmission over analog communication lines, such as those used in the Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS). They modulate the digital data into audible tones (analog signals) that can be transmitted over these telephone lines. Choices 'b', 'c', and 'd' are incorrect because baud rates refer to the number of signal changes per second, modulating electrical charges is not a standard term for describing the function of a modem, and PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) is the network infrastructure itself, not the signal transmitted.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is essentially correct. Modems do indeed convert digital signals into analog signals that can be transmitted over telephone lines, which are audible tones. However, the term ""audible wavelengths"" might be slightly misleading as it suggests a focus on the aspect of human hearing, whereas in the context of modems, the concern is more about the conversion of data into a form that can be carried over a specific medium (in this case, POTS). The term ""audible tones"" or ""analog signals"" would be more precise.

79,What are the subprotocols for PPP (Point to Point Protocol)? Select all that apply.,"a. FCS
b. LCP
c. Compression
d. NCP
","b,d","b,d","b,d","PPP (Point to Point Protocol) is a data link layer communication protocol used to establish a direct connection between two networking nodes. It can provide connection authentication, transmission encryption (using ECP, RFC 1968), and compression. PPP is composed of three main components: LCP (Link Control Protocol), NCP (Network Control Protocols), and a family of Network Protocols. LCP is used to establish, configure, and test the data-link connection. NCP is used to allow multiple network layer protocols to be used on the PPP link. FCS (Frame Check Sequence) is not a subprotocol of PPP but rather a part of the framing used to detect errors in transmitted frames. 'Compression' is a feature of PPP but not a subprotocol; it can be achieved through various means, including the Compression Control Protocol (CCP), which is a subprotocol.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer correctly identifies LCP (b) and NCP (d) as subprotocols of PPP.
