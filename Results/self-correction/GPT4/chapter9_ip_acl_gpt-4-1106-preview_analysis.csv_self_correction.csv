163,Which of the following options are things that a standard IP ACL could be configured to do? (Choose two answers.),"a. Match the exact source IP address
b. Match all IP addresses in a subnet with one access-list command without matching other IP addresses
c. Match IP addresses 20.2.2.2 through 20.2.2.22 with one access-list command without matching other IP addresses
d. Match only the packetâ€™s destination IP address","a,b","a,b","a,b","Standard IP Access Control Lists (ACLs) are used to identify traffic based on the source IP address only. They can be configured to match a single source IP address (exact match) or a range of IP addresses within a subnet by using wildcard masks in one access-list command. Option 'c' is not possible with standard IP ACLs because they cannot match a range of IP addresses with a single command without including other IP addresses outside the specified range. Standard ACLs do not evaluate the destination IP address, so option 'd' is incorrect.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. Standard IP ACLs can indeed be configured to match the exact source IP address (option a) and match all IP addresses in a subnet with one access-list command without matching other IP addresses (option b), using wildcard masks. Option c is not correct for standard IP ACLs because they cannot match a specific range of IP addresses without including others.

164,"One of the differences between named and numbered ACLs is that named ACLS using ACL subcommands, not global commands, to define the action and matching parameters.","a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",a,a,a,Named ACLs do indeed use ACL subcommands within an ACL configuration mode rather than global configuration commands. This allows for more granular control and easier management of the access control entries within the ACL.,"Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. Named Access Control Lists (ACLs) in networking devices such as Cisco routers use ACL subcommands within an ACL configuration mode. This is in contrast to numbered ACLs, which are defined with a single command line for each entry. Named ACLs provide a more flexible and manageable approach, as they allow for the individual modification, addition, and removal of entries without having to recreate the entire list. The answer correctly identifies this distinction and provides a brief explanation of the benefits.

165,"Given the following fields, which of those cannot be compared on an extended IP ACL?","a. Application protocol
b. Destination IP address
c. Source IP address
d. URL
e. TOS Byte
",d,d,d,"Extended IP Access Control Lists (ACLs) in Cisco devices allow filtering of traffic based on several criteria such as source IP address, destination IP address, protocol type, and port numbers for TCP and UDP protocols. They can also match on the Type of Service (TOS) byte. However, they do not have the ability to inspect the contents of the traffic to the level of detail required to match a URL, as URLs are part of the application layer data.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. Extended IP Access Control Lists (ACLs) are capable of filtering based on source and destination IP addresses, protocol types (such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.), and the Type of Service (TOS) byte. However, they cannot inspect the content of the traffic at the application layer, which is where the URL is found. Since ACLs operate at the network and transport layers, they cannot match on application layer fields like URLs.

The ACL command provided in option a, 'access-list 1 permit 56.57.2.0 0.0.0.255', correctly matches the criteria given in the question. The wildcard mask of 0.0.0.255 indicates that only the last octet of the IP address can vary, which means any IP address from 56.57.2.0 to 56.57.2.255 is permitted.

This would include IP addresses such as 56.0.0.1, 56.100.100.100, etc., which do not match the criteria of having both the first and second octets as 56 and 57, respectively.

The correct subnet mask for the destination is 0.0.0.255, which corresponds to the /24 prefix length. Therefore, the correct command is 'access-list 101 permit tcp host 65.5.5.5 65.5.6.0 0.0.0.255 eq www'. Option 'a' is incorrect because it specifies port 23, which is for Telnet, not web traffic.

The explanation provided correctly justifies why option 'c' is the correct answer. It identifies that the traffic is from a web client to a web server, which typically uses HTTP on port 80, and 'eq www' is indeed the correct way to denote HTTP traffic in Cisco ACLs.

The 'show startup-config' command displays the saved configuration that the router will use upon the next reload, which does not necessarily show the line numbers of ACLs. The 'show access-lists' command does not include the 'ip' keyword and might not provide the detailed IPv4-specific ACL information including line numbers.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is mostly correct. The 'show running-config' command indeed shows the current active configuration on the device, which includes ACLs and their line numbers. The 'show ip access-lists' command displays the IPv4 ACLs configured on the router with their line numbers, which is also correct. However, the explanation regarding 'show startup-config' and 'show access-lists' could be slightly misleading. While 'show startup-config' does indeed show the saved configuration, if ACLs with line numbers are present in that configuration, they will be displayed. The 'show access-lists' command will display all access lists, both IPv4 and IPv6, but may not show the line numbers unless specifically configured to do so in some Cisco IOS versions.

In this case, the last octet is completely ignored (255), while the first three octets (192.168.4) must match exactly. Therefore, the range of IP addresses matched by this command starts from 192.168.4.0 and goes up to 192.168.4.255, which includes all the IP addresses where the first three octets are 192.168.4 and the last octet can be anything from 0 to 255.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. It accurately describes the function of the wildcard mask in an access control list (ACL) and explains how the given command matches IP addresses within the specified range.

ACLs indeed process packets in sequential order, and the first statement that matches the packet will be the one that is applied.

d. access-list 101 deny udp host 30.3.3.3 gt 10455 any eq 25",d,d,,"The correct access-list command must specify UDP as the protocol, the source IP address as 30.3.3.3, and the source port as greater than 10455. The destination must be any IP address with the destination port equal to 25. Option 'd' correctly specifies all these requirements: 'access-list 101 deny udp host 30.3.3.3 gt 10455 any eq 25'. The 'host' keyword is used to specify a single IP address, 'gt' stands for 'greater than', and 'eq' stands for 'equal'. The other options either do not match the source IP address correctly or the port conditions.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is incorrect. The explanation correctly identifies the components that should be present in the access control list (ACL) entry. However, the given command in option 'd' has a syntax error. In the ACL entry, the 'host' keyword is correctly used to specify a single IP address (30.3.3.3), and 'gt' is correctly used for 'greater than'. However, the 'eq' keyword is used to specify the destination port, which should be 25 according to the question. The 'any' keyword is used to specify any destination IP address. In option 'd', the 'eq 25' is incorrectly placed after 'any', which is not the correct syntax for Cisco ACLs. The correct syntax should be 'eq 25' after specifying the destination IP address condition, which is 'any' in this case.

The correct answer should be:
access-list 101 deny udp host 30.3.3.3 gt 10455 any eq 25

This command correctly specifies the UDP protocol, the source IP address as 30.3.3.3, the source port as greater than 10455, any destination IP address, and the destination port equal to 25.

Correct Answers: None of the provided choices are correct as written. The correct ACL entry should be rephrased without the syntax error.",1,0,chapter9_ip_acl,0.0

This wildcard mask matches any IP address where the first three octets are the same and the last octet can be any value, which is exactly what is needed to match all IP packets in the subnet 46.45.44.0/24.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. A wildcard mask is indeed the inverse of the subnet mask, and for a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, the corresponding wildcard mask is 0.0.0.255. This wildcard mask will match any IP address in the subnet 46.45.44.0/24 because the first three octets must match and the last octet can be any value from 0 to 255.
