137,"In a spoofing attack, which of the following parameters are commonly spoofed? (Choose two answers)","a. Source IP address
b. MAC address
c. ARP address
d. Routing table
e. Destination IP address
f. ARP table
","a,b","a,b","a,b,f","In a spoofing attack, attackers commonly spoof the source IP address and the MAC address. Spoofing the source IP address can make the traffic appear to come from a trusted source, bypassing some forms of security checks. MAC address spoofing can be used to impersonate another device on the local network. ARP spoofing is related but it involves the corruption of the ARP table (not the ARP address itself), which is not one of the options provided. Spoofing the routing table or the destination IP address is not typically referred to as spoofing in the context of a spoofing attack; these would involve different types of attacks or manipulations.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is mostly correct. It correctly identifies source IP address spoofing (a) and MAC address spoofing (b) as common parameters that are spoofed during a spoofing attack. However, the explanation could be misleading when it states that ""ARP spoofing is related but it involves the corruption of the ARP table,"" because the ARP table (f) is indeed something that can be targeted in a spoofing attack, specifically in ARP spoofing or ARP poisoning attacks. The term ""ARP address"" (c) is not standard, but the reference to the ARP table (f) in the context of spoofing attacks would be appropriate. The explanation correctly dismisses the routing table (d) and the destination IP address (e) as not typically being spoofed in the context of a spoofing attack.

144,What can be accomplished with a brute-force attack?,"a. Guess a user’s password
b. Make a server unavailable
c. Spoof every possible IP address
d. Alter a routing table
",a,a,a,"A brute-force attack is a trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as a user password or personal identification number (PIN). In this attack, automated software is used to generate a large number of consecutive guesses to determine the value of the desired data. Brute-force attacks are known for their simplicity and reliability – they will eventually crack any code, but the time taken can be prohibitive if the password is sufficiently long and complex. This type of attack does not directly relate to making a server unavailable (which is more associated with a Denial-of-Service attack), spoofing IP addresses (which involves impersonating another device by using its IP address), or altering a routing table (which would be an attack targeting network routes, often involving routing protocols).","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. A brute-force attack is indeed a method where an attacker tries a large number of combinations to guess a user's password. The answer correctly explains what a brute-force attack is and also correctly distinguishes it from other types of attacks such as Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, IP spoofing, and attacks targeting routing tables.

b. Match message application data
c. Match message IP protocol 23
d. Match message source TCP ports lower than 5400",b,b,b,"A next-generation firewall (NGFW) goes beyond traditional firewall capabilities by incorporating additional features such as application awareness and control, integrated intrusion prevention, and cloud-delivered threat intelligence. While a traditional firewall typically filters traffic based on protocol ports and IP addresses, a NGFW can inspect the application data within the packets to identify and block specific applications, such as Telnet, regardless of the port used. This is known as deep packet inspection (DPI). Therefore, the feature that a NGFW uses that a traditional firewall would not is the ability to match message application data.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. Next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) indeed have the capability to inspect and match message application data, which is a feature beyond the capabilities of traditional firewalls. Traditional firewalls typically rely on port numbers and IP addresses to control traffic. In contrast, NGFWs use deep packet inspection to analyze the content of the traffic and can enforce policies based on the actual applications being used, not just the ports they are using. This allows them to more effectively prevent unauthorized access, such as blocking Telnet clients from the Internet even if they attempt to use non-standard ports.
