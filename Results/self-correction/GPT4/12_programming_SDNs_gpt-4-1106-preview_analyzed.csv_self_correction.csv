87,Which of the following reasons make programming OpenFlow switches difficult? Select all that apply.,"a. An OpenFlow controller only sees events for packets that the switches do not know how to handle.
b. OpenFlow networks require a single, centralized network controller.
c. Networks often have switches from multiple hardware vendors.
d. OpenFlow switches control switches at a low level of abstraction.
e. Network policies involve many independent tasks that may have conflicting behaviors.
","a,d,e","a,c,d,e","a,c,d,e","Programming OpenFlow switches can be challenging for several reasons. Firstly, an OpenFlow controller does indeed only see events for packets that the switches do not know how to handle (a), which means that the programmer must anticipate and correctly handle a wide range of scenarios that the switches themselves cannot resolve. Secondly, while OpenFlow networks can benefit from centralized control logic, it is not a strict requirement that there be a single network controller (b), so this is not inherently a reason that programming them is difficult. However, the presence of switches from multiple hardware vendors (c) can introduce complexity due to potential differences in capabilities and implementation. Controlling switches at a low level of abstraction (d) means that programmers must have detailed knowledge of the network and switch operations, which can be complex and error-prone. Lastly, network policies often involve many independent tasks that may have conflicting behaviors (e), which requires careful coordination and conflict resolution in the programming logic.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer provides a fairly comprehensive explanation of why programming OpenFlow switches can be difficult. It correctly identifies that an OpenFlow controller only sees events for packets that the switches do not know how to handle (a), and this can indeed make programming challenging. The answer also correctly points out that having switches from multiple hardware vendors (c) can introduce complexity. The explanation about controlling switches at a low level of abstraction (d) is also correct, as it increases the complexity of programming. Lastly, the point about network policies involving many independent tasks with potential conflicting behaviors (e) is valid and contributes to the difficulty of programming OpenFlow switches.

However, there is a slight inaccuracy regarding statement (b). The answer correctly notes that OpenFlow networks do not require a single, centralized network controller, but it does not explicitly state whether this fact makes programming difficult or not. The original answer implies that (b) is not a reason for difficulty, which is correct, but it could be clearer in stating that (b) is not a correct answer to the question.

89,"Suppose that a network operator wants to express a policy that drops all traffic except for traffic from a specific IP prefix (i.e., group of IP addresses).  What problems exist with expressing this policy as a set of OpenFlow rules? Select all that apply.","a. Switches have limited room for flow table entries and cannot store rules for all IP addresses in a prefix by default.
b. The controller may see more than the first packet for a flow that it has already installed.
c. If the controller installs the rules in the wrong order, all traffic might be dropped, instead of allowing the permitted traffic.
d. If the operator starts adding more IP addresses that are permitted to send traffic, performance of the switch might suffer as the number of entries in the switch table grows.
e. Flow table entries can only perform exact matches on IP addresses, so installing rules that operate on groups of IP addresses will take many flow-table entries in the switch.","a,b,c,d","a,c,d","a,c,d","a. It is true that switches have limited space in their flow tables, and therefore cannot store an individual rule for each IP address within a large prefix. OpenFlow allows for CIDR notation to specify IP prefixes, which helps to mitigate this issue by summarizing a range of IP addresses into a single rule.

b. This statement is not entirely accurate. The OpenFlow protocol is designed such that the first packet of a new flow is sent to the controller, which then decides on the action to be taken and installs a flow rule in the switch. Subsequent packets of the same flow should not be sent to the controller if the rule is properly installed.

c. The order of rule installation is crucial. If a 'drop all traffic' rule is installed before the rule allowing specific traffic, then indeed all traffic might be dropped due to the priority of the rules processed by the switch. OpenFlow rules have priority levels to handle such cases, and care must be taken to ensure rules are installed in the correct order with the correct priorities.

d. Performance issues can arise as the number of flow table entries grows. Each new entry consumes resources, and a large number of entries can slow down the switch, especially if it needs to frequently consult the controller for instructions on new flows.

e. This statement is incorrect. OpenFlow supports matching on IP prefixes using CIDR notation, which allows for matching on groups of IP addresses without needing an entry for each individual IP address. Therefore, it is possible to create rules that match on an entire IP prefix rather than requiring exact matches on IP addresses.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is mostly correct, but there is an inaccuracy in the explanation for option e. The explanation provided for option e incorrectly states that flow table entries can only perform exact matches on IP addresses. In reality, OpenFlow does support CIDR notation for IP address matching, which allows for the matching of entire IP prefixes rather than requiring exact matches for each individual IP address. This makes option e an incorrect statement regarding the capabilities of OpenFlow.

90,Which of the following have examples of sequential composition? Select all that apply.,"a. Block all port 80 traffic and count the number of packets that are blocked.
b. Load balance traffic based on whether the traffic matches a particular destination IP prefix.
c. Block all traffic except port 80 and count the number of packets that are blocked.
d. Block all traffic except port 80 traffic, and load balance port 80 traffic across three destination IP addresses.
e. Block all traffic except port 80 and count the number of packets that are not blocked.","b,d,e","a,c,e","a,c,d,e","Sequential composition in the context of Software Defined Networking (SDN) refers to the process of applying multiple network policies or actions in sequence. The following choices represent sequential composition because they involve performing one action after another in a specific order:

a. Block all port 80 traffic and count the number of packets that are blocked: This involves two sequential actions - first blocking the traffic and then counting the packets.

b. Load balancing does not inherently imply a sequence of different actions; it's a single action applied to traffic based on a condition.

c. Block all traffic except port 80 and count the number of packets that are blocked: Similar to option a, this involves first applying a block action and then counting the packets that match the criteria.

d. This option describes two actions, but they are not sequential; they are conditional. Blocking is for all traffic except port 80, and load balancing is applied only to port 80 traffic. It does not imply that one action follows the other.

e. Block all traffic except port 80 and count the number of packets that are not blocked: Again, this involves a sequence of actions - first blocking certain traffic and then counting the packets that are not blocked (which implies they are allowed through).

Options b and d are not examples of sequential composition because they describe actions that are conditional rather than sequential.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is mostly correct in identifying the options that involve sequential composition. Sequential composition indeed involves performing one action after another in a specific order. The explanation provided for each choice is accurate in determining whether or not the actions are sequential.

However, there is a slight mistake in the explanation for option d. While the original answer states that the actions described in option d are not sequential but conditional, they can be interpreted as sequential. Blocking all traffic except port 80 is the first action, and then load balancing the allowed port 80 traffic across three destination IP addresses is the second action. This does indeed imply a sequence: first, the traffic is filtered, and then the allowed traffic is load balanced. Therefore, option d should also be considered an example of sequential composition.

91,Which of the following have examples of parallel composition? Select all that apply.,"a. Perform load balancing on any traffic that arrives from prefix 130.207.0.0/16 or is destined to port 80.
b. Perform MAC learning on all traffic that is not blocked by a firewall rule.
c. Count all port 80 traffic.
d. Block all traffic whose source IP address is contained in a list of blocked IP addresses.
e. Load balance traffic across multiple destination IP addresses and perform routing to the resulting destination IP addresses.","a,c,d","a,e","a,e","Parallel composition in networking, especially in the context of Software Defined Networking (SDN), refers to the ability to apply multiple network functions or policies simultaneously to network traffic. Here's an evaluation of each option:

a. Perform load balancing on any traffic that arrives from prefix 130.207.0.0/16 or is destined to port 80. - This implies that two separate conditions (traffic from a certain IP prefix and traffic destined to a certain port) are handled in parallel to determine whether load balancing should be applied. Hence, it is an example of parallel composition.

b. Perform MAC learning on all traffic that is not blocked by a firewall rule. - This describes a sequential process where MAC learning is applied only after firewall rules have been considered, which is not an example of parallel composition.

c. Count all port 80 traffic. - This is a singular action applied to traffic and does not involve parallel processes.

d. Block all traffic whose source IP address is contained in a list of blocked IP addresses. - This is another singular action that does not involve parallel processes.

e. Load balance traffic across multiple destination IP addresses and perform routing to the resulting destination IP addresses. - This option describes two actions (load balancing and routing) that are applied to the traffic in parallel, which makes it an example of parallel composition.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. Parallel composition involves executing multiple network policies or functions simultaneously. Both options a and e describe scenarios where multiple network functions are being applied to the traffic simultaneously. In option a, load balancing is performed based on two different criteria (source prefix and destination port), which can be considered parallel conditions for the application of load balancing. In option e, load balancing and routing are two distinct actions that are performed simultaneously on the traffic, fitting the definition of parallel composition.

92,Which of the following is the appropriate Pyretic rule for matching traffic that sends packets from either 10.0.0.1 or 10.0.0.2 to IP address 1.2.3.4?,"a. (match(srcip=10.0.0.1) >> match(srcip=10.0.0.2)) + mod(dstip=1.2.3.4)
b. (match(srcip=10.0.0.1) + match(srcip=10.0.0.2)) + mod(dstip=1.2.3.4)

e.

The '>>' operator is the sequential composition operator, which specifies that the action on the right should be taken on packets that match the condition on the left. To match traffic from either 10.0.0.1 or 10.0.0.2, we should use the '+' operator between the two match conditions. After matching the source IP addresses, we want to apply the modification to the destination IP, which means using the '>>' operator to indicate that this action should be taken after the match. Therefore, the correct rule is to match either source IP and then modify the destination IP, which is represented in option (c) as '(match(srcip=10.0.0.1) + match(srcip=10.0.0.2)) >> mod(dstip=1.2.3.4)'.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer provides an accurate explanation of the Pyretic operators and their usage. In Pyretic, 'match' is indeed used to specify packet fields for matching, '+' is the parallel composition operator, and '>>' is the sequential composition operator. The explanation correctly states that to match traffic from either 10.0.0.1 or 10.0.0.2, the '+' operator should be used between the two match conditions, followed by the '>>' operator to apply the modification to the destination IP. The answer correctly identifies option (c) as the rule that matches either source IP and then modifies the destination IP.

The '>>' operator is used to denote that the action on the right should be applied to packets that match the criteria on the left. The '+' operator is used to denote a parallel composition of policies, where both policies apply independently. The correct rule should match the source IP address and modify the destination IP address for each flow, and use the '+' operator to apply both rules independently. Option b correctly uses the '>>' operator to combine the match and mod functions for each flow and the '+' operator to combine the two flows. Options a, c, d, and e either use incorrect operators or combine the policies inappropriately for the described behavior.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. In Pyretic, the 'match' function is indeed used to specify the criteria for selecting packets, and the 'mod' function is used to specify the actions to be taken on packets that match the specified criteria. The '>>' operator is used to indicate that the action specified by 'mod' should be applied to packets that match the criteria specified by 'match'. The '+' operator is used to combine two policies so that they apply independently. Option b correctly combines these functions and operators to achieve the desired behavior of matching and modifying packets from two different source IP addresses to two different destination IP addresses.

b. Drop all traffic arriving from source IP addresses in prefix 10.0.0.0/8.
c. Assign each new traffic flow to a different destination IP address based on a round-robin load balancing policy across servers.
d. Count all traffic arriving from source IP addresses in prefix 10.0.0.0/8.
e. Forward traffic through the network based on shortest paths routing, re-routing traffic appropriately when links or nodes fail.","a,c,e","a,c,e","a,c,e","Dynamic policies in Pyretic and other Software Defined Networking (SDN) platforms are used for network behaviors that change over time or need to adapt to different conditions. Let's evaluate each choice:

a. Checking each new traffic flow against a list of permitted and prohibited source IP addresses that may change over time is a dynamic policy because the list of IP addresses can be updated frequently as network requirements change.

b. Dropping all traffic from a static IP prefix is a static policy because it does not change over time or adapt to network conditions.

c. Assigning each new traffic flow to a different destination IP address based on a round-robin load balancing policy is a dynamic policy because it changes with each new flow, distributing the load among servers.

d. Counting all traffic from a static IP prefix is generally a static monitoring policy and does not by itself imply a dynamic response to changing network conditions.

e. Forwarding traffic based on shortest paths routing and rerouting traffic when links or nodes fail is a dynamic policy because it adapts to changes in the network topology.

Therefore, the examples that would use a dynamic policy in Pyretic are a, c, and e.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. It accurately identifies which scenarios involve dynamic policies within the context of Pyretic, which is an SDN platform. The explanations for each choice are clear and correctly justify why each one is considered dynamic or static. The answer correctly identifies that dynamic policies are those that change over time or need to adapt to different conditions, which applies to options a, c, and e.
