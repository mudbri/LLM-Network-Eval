23,Which of the following are examples of control plane operations? Select all that apply.,"a. Rate-limiting traffic so that the overall sending rate does not exceed a certain throughput.
b. Determining that a user's MAC address is authentic before allowing it to send traffic on the network.
c. Load balancing traffic across two output ports based on the hash of each packet's source IP address.
d. Determining the forwarding path that satisfies an access control policy.
e. Computing a shortest path routing tree.
","b,d,e","b,d,e","b,d,e","Control plane operations in networking are those that involve making decisions about how traffic should be handled by the network. These operations typically involve network-wide logic and state, rather than the per-packet handling that occurs in the data plane. Let's evaluate each choice:

a. Rate-limiting traffic is generally considered a data plane operation because it involves the enforcement of policies at the packet level as they traverse the network.

b. Determining that a user's MAC address is authentic is a control plane operation because it involves network policies and security measures to ensure that only valid users are allowed to send traffic.

c. Load balancing traffic across output ports based on the hash of each packet's source IP address is a data plane operation. It involves making forwarding decisions on a per-packet basis, which is typically done in the data plane.

d. Determining the forwarding path that satisfies an access control policy is a control plane function. This involves calculating and enforcing network-wide policies and routes.

e. Computing a shortest path routing tree is a classic control plane operation. It involves an algorithmic process to determine the best paths through the network for traffic to take, which is a network-wide consideration.

Therefore, the correct answers are options b, d, and e, which are all control plane operations.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer provided is correct. The explanation accurately distinguishes between control plane and data plane operations. It correctly identifies that rate-limiting traffic (choice a) and load balancing traffic (choice c) are data plane operations because they deal with the actual handling of packets as they pass through the network. Choices b, d, and e are control plane operations as they involve decision-making processes that affect how traffic is managed and routed across the network, including authentication, policy enforcement, and routing decisions.

25,What could be the operational steps behind the AT&T's IRSCP (a commercial version of the Routing Control Platform) for detecting malicious traffic? Select all that apply.,"a. The controller sees all traffic passing through the network, detects an attack, and installs a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where the attack traffic is originating.
b. The end host changes its IP address so that it is no longer the target of the attack traffic.
c. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to re-route traffic through a deep-packet inspection device.
d. A measurement system detects an attack, identifies the entry point of the attack, and instructs a controller to install a null route to drop traffic at the entry point where attack traffic is originating.
e. A victim end host sends an alert to an on-path firewall about the source and nature of an attack, at which point the firewall installs a null route to drop the traffic at the entry point where the attack is originating.
","c,d","a,c,d","a,c,d","The AT&T's IRSCP (Integrated Routing and Service Control Point), which is a commercial version of the Routing Control Platform, is designed to enhance network management and security. Hereâ€™s an analysis of each option based on what such a system might do to detect and mitigate malicious traffic:

a. The controller, as part of a software-defined networking (SDN) system, could indeed see all the traffic and have the capability to detect an attack. Upon detection, the controller can install a null route to drop the malicious traffic at the entry point, preventing it from traversing the network. This is a plausible step for such a system.

b. This option is less likely to be a direct function of IRSCP, as changing the IP address of the end host is typically not a network control function but rather an action that might be taken by the end host itself or its administrator.

c. A measurement system, which could be part of or integrated with the IRSCP, may detect an attack and identify its entry point. The system could then instruct a controller to re-route the suspicious traffic for further inspection, such as through a deep-packet inspection device. This is a common mitigation strategy in advanced network management systems.

d. Similar to option (a), a measurement system could detect an attack and instruct a controller to install a null route. This is another plausible operational step for a system designed to control routing based on detected threats.

e. This option suggests that the victim end host directly communicates with a firewall to manage the attack traffic. While possible in some network setups, it's less likely to be a function of a centralized routing control platform like IRSCP, which typically would not rely on end hosts to dictate network routing decisions.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer provides a thorough evaluation of the options presented in the question. The analysis of options a, c, and d is correct, as they are consistent with the functionalities that a system like AT&T's IRSCP might offer. The system is designed to improve network management and security, and one of its features could include detecting attacks and mitigating them by installing null routes or rerouting traffic for inspection. 

Option b is correctly identified as less likely to be a function of the IRSCP, as the system is not typically responsible for changing the IP addresses of end hosts.

Option e is also correctly identified as less likely to be a function of IRSCP. The explanation provided is accurate in that a centralized routing control platform would not usually depend on end hosts to manage routing decisions, but would instead make those decisions based on traffic analysis and network policies.

Therefore, the original answer's conclusion that options a, c, and d are plausible steps that IRSCP might take to detect and mitigate malicious traffic is correct.

26,What are some example network management applications that become easier with control and data plane separation? Select all that apply.,"a. Improved interdomain routing security.
b. Customer-controlled egress selection.
c. Improved logging capabilities.
d. Planned maintenance of an edge router.
e. Forecasting of network capacity.
","a,b,d","a,b,d,e","a,b,c,d,e","The separation of the control and data planes is a fundamental aspect of Software Defined Networking (SDN). It allows for more centralized and flexible network management. Here's how the choices relate to this concept: 

(a) Improved interdomain routing security: With SDN, security policies can be more dynamically and centrally enforced, improving the security of routing between domains. 

(b) Customer-controlled egress selection: SDN enables customers to have more control over their traffic flows, including the selection of egress points, due to the centralized control plane. 

(c) Improved logging capabilities: While SDN can potentially improve logging by centralizing the control of network devices, logging capabilities are not inherently dependent on the separation of control and data planes. Better logging can be achieved with other technologies and does not necessarily become easier solely because of this separation. 

(d) Planned maintenance of an edge router: SDN allows network administrators to reroute traffic and manage the network more effectively during maintenance periods. 

(e) Forecasting of network capacity: With a centralized control plane, it is easier to collect and analyze data to forecast network capacity needs.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer correctly identifies that the separation of control and data planes, as seen in SDN, can facilitate various network management applications. However, it incorrectly excludes improved logging capabilities (c) as a benefit directly related to control and data plane separation. While it is true that improved logging is not solely dependent on this separation, SDN can enhance logging capabilities by providing a centralized view of the network, which can simplify the collection and correlation of logs across various devices. Therefore, improved logging capabilities could also be considered as becoming easier with control and data plane separation.

c. Better security properties.
d. Better scaling properties.
e. Better load balancing properties.
",b,"b,d,e","b,d,e","Layer-2 forwarding in a data center has several motivations, but not all of the options listed are correct. Here's an evaluation of each choice:

a. Ability to use existing routing protocols to establish paths between hosts. - This is not a motivation for Layer-2 forwarding since routing protocols are typically used at Layer-3 for path determination between different networks or subnets.

b. Easier configuration/administration, since there is no need to number hosts or configure subnets. - This is correct. Layer-2 forwarding simplifies configuration and administration because it does not require IP addressing and subnetting as Layer-3 does.

c. Better security properties. - This is generally not true. Layer-2 networks are prone to certain types of attacks, such as ARP spoofing and MAC flooding, which do not apply to Layer-3 networks. Security is not inherently better at Layer-2.

d. Better scaling properties. - This can be true in the context of overlay networks like VXLAN, which allow for better scalability in large data center environments by extending Layer-2 networks over Layer-3 infrastructure.

e. Better load balancing properties. - Layer-2 forwarding can offer better load balancing properties by allowing traffic to be spread out across multiple physical paths without the need for complex routing protocols or policies.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer provides an accurate assessment of the motivations for using Layer-2 forwarding in a data center. It correctly identifies that Layer-2 forwarding simplifies configuration and administration (b), can offer better scaling properties in certain contexts like overlay networks (d), and can provide better load balancing properties (e).

28,How does the separation of the control and data plane make networking in data centers easier?,"a. Virtual machines can be migrated within the network without renumbering entire portions of the network or re-assigning network services to different IP addresses.
b. The control plane allows traffic to be forwarded using Layer 2 addresses, thus allowing automatic load balance across the topology.
c. The separation allows fewer switches to be used in the data center topology, thus lowering costs.
d. All routes can be controlled and monitored from a central point of control.
e. A network controller can permit the renumbering of end hosts to have topology-dependent Layer 2 MAC addresses.","a,d,e","a,d","a,d","The separation of the control and data planes is a fundamental concept in Software Defined Networking (SDN). It allows for centralized management and the abstraction of the underlying network infrastructure from the applications and network services that use it.

a. True. The separation allows for more dynamic network configurations, which facilitates the migration of virtual machines without the need to renumber or reassign network services to different IP addresses. This is because the control logic is abstracted from the underlying hardware, enabling more flexible management of network resources.

d. True. With a centralized control plane, all routing decisions and network policies can be managed from a single point, which simplifies monitoring and control over the network.

b. False. While SDN can enable more intelligent traffic forwarding, the statement about using Layer 2 addresses for automatic load balancing is not directly related to the separation of the control and data planes. Load balancing can be achieved through various means and is not inherently a result of this separation.

c. False. The separation of control and data planes does not necessarily mean fewer switches are used. The number of switches in a data center topology is determined by the size and design of the network, not just by the separation of planes.

e. False. Renumbering end hosts to have topology-dependent MAC addresses is not a typical function of SDN. While SDN does provide flexibility in managing network resources, it does not inherently permit the renumbering of end hosts to have topology-dependent Layer 2 MAC addresses.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is mostly correct. It accurately explains the benefits of separating the control and data planes in the context of Software Defined Networking (SDN). The explanations for options (a) and (d) are valid, as they describe the advantages of centralized management and dynamic network configurations. However, the explanations for options (b), (c), and (e) could be expanded to clarify why they are not correct.

Correct Answers: a, d

Option (b) is not a direct result of the separation of control and data planes; it is a potential capability of SDN but not inherently due to the separation itself.
Option (c) is incorrect because the number of switches is related to network size and design, not the separation of the control and data planes.
Option (e) is incorrect as it describes a specific use case that is not a general outcome of control and data plane separation in SDN.",0,0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.6000000000000001
29,"What are some examples of problems that can arise from consistency problems in the control plane, where a network has multiple controller replicas?","a. A flood of traffic at the controller.
b. Inability to respond to link failures.
c. Incorrect security policies.
d. Incorrect operation when one controller fails.
e. Forwarding loops.
","c,e","b,c,e","a,b,c,d,e","In a Software Defined Networking (SDN) architecture, the control plane is responsible for making decisions about where traffic should be sent. Multiple controller replicas are often used for redundancy and reliability. However, if there are consistency problems among these replicas, several issues can arise. Inability to respond to link failures (b) could occur if one controller is not aware of the current network state due to inconsistency. Incorrect security policies (c) might be applied if different controllers have conflicting information about the network configuration or security rules. Forwarding loops (e) can occur if inconsistent routing information is distributed by the controllers, causing packets to be sent in a loop between switches. A flood of traffic at the controller (a) and incorrect operation when one controller fails (d) are not necessarily direct results of consistency problems among controller replicas, but rather issues that could arise from other operational problems within the SDN environment.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer correctly identifies three potential problems that can arise from consistency problems in the control plane with multiple controller replicas in an SDN environment: inability to respond to link failures, incorrect security policies, and forwarding loops. However, it dismisses the possibility of ""a flood of traffic at the controller"" and ""incorrect operation when one controller fails"" as not being direct results of consistency problems. While it is true that these issues can also arise from other operational problems, it is not entirely accurate to say that they cannot be related to consistency problems. For example, if there is a consistency problem and one controller fails, the remaining controllers may not take over correctly, leading to incorrect operation (d). Similarly, if controllers are not consistent, they may generate unnecessary or conflicting control traffic, potentially leading to a flood of traffic at the controller (a), especially in scenarios where controllers are trying to synchronize their state. Therefore, the original answer could be more comprehensive in considering the potential impact of consistency problems.

b. Keeping a ""hot spare"" replica that has a complete view of the network state.
c. Only keeping a subset of the network state in memory at any time.
d. Using different controllers for independent parts of the network.
e. Having multiple controllers install forwarding table entries on the same router and resolving the conflict on the router itself.
","a,b,c,d","a,b,d","a,b,d","In a Software Defined Networking (SDN) environment, maintaining consistency across controller replicas is crucial for the correct functioning of the network. Here is an analysis of each option provided in the context of coping with inconsistency across controller replicas:

a. Running a consistency protocol across controller replicas is a common approach to ensure that all replicas have a consistent view of the network state. This can be done through various consensus algorithms like Raft or Paxos.

b. Keeping a 'hot spare' replica implies having a backup controller that can quickly take over in case the primary controller fails. This replica would have a complete view of the network state and can help in maintaining consistency during failovers.

c. Only keeping a subset of the network state in memory at any time does not directly address the issue of inconsistency across replicas. Instead, it may actually contribute to inconsistency if different replicas hold different subsets of the network state.

d. Using different controllers for independent parts of the network can help in reducing the scope of inconsistency as each controller manages a separate domain. However, it does not eliminate the need for consistency within each domain.

e. Having multiple controllers install forwarding table entries on the same router and resolving the conflict on the router itself would likely lead to inconsistency and unpredictable network behavior, as routers are not designed to resolve conflicts that are meant to be managed by controllers.

Therefore, the approaches that help in coping with inconsistency across controller replicas are running a consistency protocol (a), keeping a 'hot spare' (b), and using different controllers for independent parts of the network (d).","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer provides a detailed explanation for each option and correctly identifies which approaches can help in coping with inconsistency across controller replicas. The explanations for options (a), (b), and (d) are accurate and reflect a good understanding of SDN controller consistency mechanisms.

Option (a) is indeed a standard practice where consistency protocols ensure that all controller replicas have a synchronized state. Option (b) describes the use of a 'hot spare' which is a common technique for high availability and can contribute to maintaining consistency during failovers. Option (d) is a strategy that can simplify consistency requirements by segmenting control of the network, although it does not eliminate the need for consistency within each segment.

Option (c) is correctly identified as not directly addressing inconsistency across replicas; it could potentially lead to more inconsistency issues. Option (e) is also correctly dismissed as it would create conflicts and is not a standard practice for handling inconsistencies in SDN environments.

e. Running multiple controllers, and having each controller only manage a part of the network.
","a,b,c,e","a,c,e","a,b,c,e","In Software Defined Networking (SDN), control and data plane separation can lead to scalability challenges. To cope with these challenges, several approaches can be taken: 

a. Caching forwarding decisions in the data plane is a commonly used method to reduce the number of queries to the controller for repeated decisions, thus reducing traffic and load on the controller.

b. Limiting control-plane operations to a set of network operations may not directly address scalability, as the limitation could introduce bottlenecks or reduce network functionality.

c. Eliminating redundant data structures within the control plane can help in optimizing the use of resources, leading to better scalability.

d. Sending all traffic through the controller is counterproductive to scalability because it would significantly increase the load on the controller, making the network less scalable and introducing a single point of failure.

e. Running multiple controllers with each managing a partition of the network is a distributed approach that can enhance scalability and reliability by distributing the control plane load across multiple controllers.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer provided is mostly correct. It correctly identifies options a, c, and e as valid approaches to addressing scalability issues in networks with a separated control and data plane, such as in Software Defined Networking (SDN). However, the explanation for option b is slightly misleading. While it states that limiting control-plane operations may not directly address scalability and could introduce bottlenecks, this is not entirely accurate. In practice, performing control-plane operations only for a necessary set of network operations can indeed help with scalability by reducing the load on the controller. The explanation for option d correctly identifies it as a counterproductive approach to scalability.

Correct Answers: a, b, c, e

Option b should be included because limiting control-plane operations to essential network operations can help to manage the scalability of the network by reducing unnecessary load on the controller. This is a common practice in SDN where certain operations can be programmed to be handled directly by the data plane after initial setup by the control plane, thus improving scalability.",0,0,4_control_and_data_separation,1.0
32,"Which property guarantees that each RCP replica continues to install correct forwarding state in the network data plane, even in the case of a partition in the data plane?","a. Each controller has a complete view of the portion of the network that it is controlling, and therefore can guarantee consistent routing within that partition.
b. The controller cannot see many of the routers in the network anyway, so there is no way for it to install incorrect routing state in the routers that it is not connected to.
c. The controllers are partitioned from the network routers, and the routers will fall back to running a distributed routing protocol.
d. Running the network from a single high-level control plane guarantees that network partitions and loops never occur in the first place.
",a,a,a,"The property described in the question relates to the ability of a Software Defined Networking (SDN) controller to maintain a consistent forwarding state despite network partitions. Option (a) is correct because if each controller maintains a complete view of the network, or at least the portion it controls, it can ensure that the forwarding state within that partition remains consistent and correct. This is one of the fundamental principles of SDN, where the control plane (controller) has an overarching view of the network state and can make informed decisions even in the case of partitions. Options (b), (c), and (d) do not guarantee correct forwarding state in the event of a partition. Option (b) incorrectly suggests that a lack of visibility is beneficial, which is not the case. Option (c) suggests that routers will revert to distributed routing protocols, which does not guarantee the correct forwarding state as maintained by the controller. Option (d) is incorrect because it assumes that a single control plane can prevent partitions, which is not always possible in real-world network scenarios.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. It accurately explains why option (a) is the correct choice by highlighting the importance of each controller having a complete view of its controlled portion of the network, which allows for consistent routing within that partition. The evaluation of the other options is also correct, pointing out why they do not guarantee the correct forwarding state. The explanation is in line with the principles of SDN where the control plane is responsible for maintaining the network state and ensuring correct forwarding decisions.
