191,"You are creating a new WLAN with the controller GUI, which of the following parameters are necessary? (Choose two)","a. VLAN number
b. SSID
c. Interface
d. BSSID
e. IP subnet
","b,c","a,b","b,c","When creating a new Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) using a controller's graphical user interface (GUI), the two necessary parameters are the VLAN number and the Service Set Identifier (SSID). The VLAN number is used to associate the WLAN with a specific VLAN, segregating traffic for security and organizational purposes. The SSID is the network name that clients will see and use to connect to the WLAN. The interface is often associated with a VLAN, but it is not a parameter you 'create' as part of the WLAN; it is something you associate the WLAN with. The Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID) is a parameter that is automatically generated (it is the MAC address of the wireless access point), so it is not something you manually configure. The IP subnet is related to the network design but is not a WLAN parameter in the controller GUI.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is incorrect. While the SSID is indeed a necessary parameter when creating a new WLAN, the VLAN number is not strictly necessary for the WLAN itself—it is an additional configuration that may be applied to segregate traffic. The essential parameters for creating a WLAN typically include the SSID and the interface to which the WLAN is mapped. The interface often includes configuration details such as the IP subnet and VLAN information, but it is the interface that is the necessary parameter, not the VLAN number itself. The BSSID is automatically generated and is not a parameter that needs to be manually configured when creating a WLAN.
