21,Which of the following commands checks the status of the interfaces?,"a. show interface
b. show status
c. show interface status
d. show status interface
",c,c,a,"The 'show interface status' command in Cisco IOS is used to display a quick overview of the status of all interfaces on a switch, including their connected status (connected, not connected, disabled), their VLAN assignment, duplex mode, speed, and their port name/type. The 'show interface' command provides detailed information about a single interface or all interfaces, including statistics, but does not provide the concise summary of interface statuses that 'show interface status' does. The other options 'show status' and 'show status interface' are not valid Cisco IOS commands.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer, option (c) 'show interface status', is incorrect. The 'show interface status' command in Cisco IOS is not a standard command. The correct command for checking the status of the interfaces on a Cisco device is 'show interfaces' without the 'status'. The 'show interfaces' command provides detailed information about the interface, including the interface status, protocol status, and various statistics. The explanation provided confuses the standard 'show interfaces' command with a non-standard command that does not exist in Cisco IOS. The correct answer should be 'show interface' (option a).

22,You are in console line configuration mode. Which of the following commands would place you in enable mode?,"a. end
b. back
c. enable
d. change
",a,a,a,"The 'end' command in console line configuration mode will return you to privileged EXEC mode, which is also known as enable mode. The other commands listed do not perform this function within the Cisco IOS command-line interface.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. In Cisco IOS, when you are in console line configuration mode (or any other configuration mode), the 'end' command is used to return to privileged EXEC mode, which is also known as enable mode. The 'back' command is not a standard Cisco IOS command, 'enable' is used to enter privileged EXEC mode from user EXEC mode, not from configuration mode, and 'change' is not a command related to moving between modes in Cisco IOS.

23,Which of the following commands copies the configuration from RAM into NVRAM,"a. copy running-config startup-config
b. copy startup-config running-config
c. copy ram nvram
d. copy nvram ram
",a,a,a,"The command 'copy running-config startup-config' is used to save the current running configuration (stored in RAM) to the startup configuration file in the NVRAM. This ensures that the configuration will be retained after a reboot. The running configuration is the current configuration in use by the device, and the startup configuration is the configuration that the device loads when it boots up.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The command 'copy running-config startup-config' is indeed used to save the current running configuration from RAM to the startup configuration in NVRAM on Cisco devices. This command ensures that the changes made to the configuration will persist after the device is restarted.

Correct Answers: a. copy running-config startup-config",1,0,chapter2_ethernet_lans,1.0
24,"The command that configures the switch as a DHCP client to discover its IPv4 address, mask, and default gateway is ip address dhcp.","a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",a,a,a,"The command 'ip address dhcp' is used on a Cisco switch or router interface to configure the device to obtain its IPv4 address, subnet mask, and default gateway from a DHCP server. This command enables the DHCP client feature on the interface.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is incorrect. The command 'ip address dhcp' is indeed used to configure a Cisco device interface to obtain its IPv4 address, subnet mask, and default gateway from a DHCP server. However, the command is not complete. On a Cisco switch or router, the command should be applied in the interface configuration mode, and the correct command is 'ip address dhcp' preceded by 'interface' configuration mode. For example:

```
Switch> enable
Switch# configure terminal
Switch(config)# interface vlan1
Switch(config-if)# ip address dhcp
Switch(config-if)# end
```

This sequence of commands enters global configuration mode, then interface configuration mode for the default VLAN 1, and finally applies the 'ip address dhcp' command to the interface. Without specifying the interface, the command 'ip address dhcp' alone does not configure the device as a DHCP client.

25,In which of the following modes of the CLI could you configure the duplex setting for interface Fast Ethernet 0/2?,"a. Global configuration mode
b. Enable mode
c. Interface configuration mode
d. VLAN mode
",c,c,c,"The duplex setting for a specific interface, such as Fast Ethernet 0/2, is configured in the interface configuration mode. This mode is accessed by entering the global configuration mode first and then entering the command 'interface FastEthernet0/2' to select the interface to configure.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. To configure the duplex setting for an interface like Fast Ethernet 0/2, you need to be in the interface configuration mode. You access this mode by first entering global configuration mode using the 'configure terminal' or 'conf t' command in enable mode, and then specifying the interface you want to configure with the 'interface FastEthernet0/2' command.

Correct Answers: c. Interface configuration mode",1,0,chapter2_ethernet_lans,1.0
26,Which of the following commands administratively enables an interface,"a. shutdown
b. no shutdown
c. enable interface
d. interface enable
",b,b,b,"The 'no shutdown' command is used to administratively enable an interface on a Cisco device. This command is entered in the interface configuration mode to bring the interface up (if it is not physically down). The 'shutdown' command is used to administratively disable the interface, and the other options 'enable interface' and 'interface enable' are not valid Cisco IOS commands for enabling an interface.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The 'no shutdown' command is indeed used to administratively enable an interface on Cisco devices. It is entered in the interface configuration mode and is the opposite of the 'shutdown' command, which disables the interface. The other options provided are not standard commands for enabling an interface in Cisco IOS.

27,"Switches use STP to prevent loops by causing some interfaces to block, meaning that they do not send or receive frames.","a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",a,a,a,"Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is used by switches to prevent broadcast storms and routing loops in a network. STP does this by making some switches' interfaces go into a blocking state where they do not forward frames, effectively breaking the loop and ensuring a loop-free topology.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is indeed used by network switches to prevent loops in a local area network (LAN) environment. When STP is in operation, it will indeed cause some interfaces to go into a blocking state if it determines that doing so would prevent a network loop. In the blocking state, those interfaces do not send or receive (forward) frames, thus preventing the possibility of broadcast storms or routing loops.

28,A Layer 2 switch configuration places all its physical ports into VLAN 2. The IP addressing plan shows that address 175.28.1.150 (with mask 255.255.255.0) is reserved for use by this new LAN switch and that 175.28.1.254 is already configured on the router connected to that same VLAN. The switch needs to support SSH connections into the switch from any subnet in the network. Which of the following commands are part of the required configuration in this case? (Choose two answers.),"a. The switch cannot support SSH because all its ports connect to VLAN 2, and the IP address must be configured on interface VLAN 1.
b. The ip address 175.28.1.150 255.255.255.0 command in interface vlan 2 configuration mode.
c. The ip default-gateway 175.28.1.254 command in global configuration mode.
d. The ip address 172.16.2.250 255.255.255.0 command in interface vlan 1 configuration mode.
e. The ip default-gateway 175.28.1.150 command in global configuration mode.","b,c","b,c","b,c","In order to configure a Layer 2 switch to support SSH connections, the switch needs to have an IP address assigned to a VLAN interface for management purposes, and it should know the default gateway to reach networks that are not directly connected. Since all physical ports are in VLAN 2, the switch's management IP address should also be in VLAN 2. Therefore, the command to assign the IP address to VLAN 2 is 'ip address 175.28.1.150 255.255.255.0' in interface VLAN 2 configuration mode. Additionally, to reach other subnets, the switch must be configured with a default gateway using the 'ip default-gateway 175.28.1.254' command in global configuration mode. Option 'a' is incorrect because the IP address does not have to be on VLAN 1; it should be on the VLAN that is used for management. Option 'd' is incorrect because the IP address belongs to a different subnet. Option 'e' is incorrect because it suggests using the switch's own IP address as the default gateway, which is not valid.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The explanation provided is accurate and correctly addresses the question. It explains why options 'b' and 'c' are the correct choices for configuring a Layer 2 switch to support SSH connections from any subnet in the network. The answer also correctly dismisses the other options, explaining why they are not suitable for the given scenario.

2. Set the password with 'password examsdigest'.
3. Enable the login command to require the password for console access with 'login'.
4. Exit the configuration mode with 'exit'.

Option 'b' configures an encrypted password for privileged exec mode, not the console line. Option 'c' is incorrect because there is no 'enable console' command in Cisco IOS. Option 'd' configures the password for VTY lines (used for remote access like SSH or Telnet), not for the console line.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. It accurately describes the process for setting a password on the console line of a Cisco device and identifies the correct sequence of commands as presented in option 'a'. The explanation provided correctly distinguishes between the console password and other passwords such as the enable secret (privileged exec mode) and VTY line passwords.

The correct command sequence starts with 'line vty' followed by the range of vty lines you want to configure. In this case, 'line vty 0 15' covers all 16 possible vty lines (0 to 15). After entering the line configuration mode, you set the password with the 'password' command followed by the desired password, and then the 'login' command to require the password for telnet access. The 'end' command takes you back to privileged EXEC mode. Therefore, option 'd' is the correct sequence of commands to meet the requirement.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is mostly correct, but there is a typo in the command provided. The command should be 'line vty 0 15' rather than 'live vty 0 15'. This seems to be a typographical error. The rest of the explanation is accurate, and it correctly describes the process of configuring a password for all vty lines for telnet access.
