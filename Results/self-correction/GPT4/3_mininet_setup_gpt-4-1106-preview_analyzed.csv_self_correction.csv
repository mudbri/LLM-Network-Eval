16,Which of the following command is used to generate an OpenFlow network topology consisting of a single switch and 8 hosts with randomly generated MAC addresses for each host?,"a. sudo mn --topo single,8  --switch ovsk --controller remote
b. sudo mn --topo single,3 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
c. sudo mn --topo single,8 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
d. sudo mn --topo linear,8  --switch ovsk --controller remote",a,c,c,"The Mininet command 'sudo mn' is used to create a network topology in a Software Defined Networking (SDN) environment. The '--topo' flag specifies the topology type and the number of nodes. The 'single,8' argument indicates a single switch connected to 8 hosts. The '--mac' flag is used to automatically assign MAC addresses to the hosts. The '--switch ovsk' specifies the use of the Open vSwitch kernel switch, and '--controller remote' indicates that the switch should connect to a remote controller. Therefore, the command that generates an OpenFlow network topology with a single switch and 8 hosts, each with a randomly generated MAC address, is 'sudo mn --topo single,8 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote'.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. It accurately describes the functionality of the Mininet command provided in option c. The command 'sudo mn --topo single,8 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote' indeed creates a network topology with a single switch and 8 hosts, with the '--mac' flag ensuring that each host has a randomly generated MAC address. The explanation given is clear and correctly justifies why option c is the correct choice.

17,What is the purpose of --mac flag used in mininet?,"a. Generates random MAC addresses for the hosts.
b. Generates sequential MAC addresses for the hosts, matching their IP address.
c. Generates sequential MAC addresses for the switch ports, matching their IP address.
d. Generates random MAC addresses for the switch ports.
",b,b,b,"The --mac flag in Mininet is used to generate MAC addresses for the hosts that are sequential and correspond to their IP addresses. This simplifies the process of identifying hosts in a network because their MAC addresses are predictable and structured in a way that relates to their IP addresses. It does not generate random MAC addresses nor does it apply to switch ports, which are not typically assigned IP addresses in the same manner as hosts.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The `--mac` flag in Mininet is indeed used to generate MAC addresses for the hosts that are sequential. This feature is particularly useful for creating a network topology where hosts have MAC addresses that are easily associated with their IP addresses, thus making it easier to identify and manage the hosts within the network.

20,"What is the purpose of dpctl, provided with mininet?","a. To enable visibility and control over a single switchâ€™s flow table.
b. To enable visibility and control over multiple switch flow table.
c. Is an OpenFlow controller.
",a,a,a,"dpctl is a command-line utility that is used to interact with OpenFlow switches. It is provided with Mininet, which is a network emulator. The primary purpose of dpctl is to enable visibility and control over a single switch's flow table. It allows users to add, delete, and modify flow entries in the flow table of the switch, which is essential for managing how the switch handles packets. It does not inherently provide visibility or control over multiple switch flow tables simultaneously, nor is it an OpenFlow controller itself; controllers are separate entities that manage multiple switches in an SDN environment.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. dpctl is indeed a command-line utility that is used to interact with OpenFlow switches, and it is provided with Mininet. The primary purpose of dpctl is to enable visibility and control over a single switch's flow table, allowing users to manage how packets are handled by the switch. The answer correctly distinguishes dpctl from an OpenFlow controller and clarifies that dpctl does not provide control over multiple switch flow tables simultaneously.
