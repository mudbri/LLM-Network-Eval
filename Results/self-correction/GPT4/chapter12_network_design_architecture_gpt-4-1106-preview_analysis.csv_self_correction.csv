213,"A company uses a Metro Ethernet WAN with an Ethernet LAN (E-LAN) service, with the company headquarters plus 20 remote sites connected to the service. The enterprise uses OSPF at all sites, with one router connected to the service from each site. Which of the following are true about the Layer 3 details most likely used with this service and design? (Choose all that apply)","a. The WAN uses one IP subnet
b. The WAN uses 20 or more IP subnets
c. A remote site router would have one OSPF neighbor
d. A remote site router would have 20 OSPF neighbors","a,d","a,c","a,d","In a Metro Ethernet E-LAN service, all sites appear to be on the same Ethernet network, which allows for a single IP subnet to be used across the WAN. This is because E-LAN service provides full-mesh connectivity between all locations, mimicking a LAN over a metropolitan area. Therefore, option 'a' is correct. Since all sites seem to be on the same LAN, each router would only need to form an OSPF adjacency with the headquarters router, not with every other site's router. This means a remote site router would typically have one OSPF neighbor, which is the headquarters router that appears to be on the same LAN segment, making option 'c' also correct. Options 'b' and 'd' are incorrect because they suggest a point-to-point or hub-and-spoke topology, which is not how an E-LAN service operates.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is partially correct but contains a significant error in its explanation of OSPF neighbor relationships. While it is true that an E-LAN service can allow for the use of a single IP subnet across the WAN, as it provides full-mesh connectivity (making option 'a' correct), the explanation for option 'c' is incorrect. In an OSPF-enabled network with full-mesh connectivity, each router would form an OSPF adjacency with every other router on the same broadcast domain or network segment, not just with the headquarters router. This means that a remote site router would have OSPF neighbors with all other site routers, not just one. Therefore, option 'c' is incorrect, and the correct answer for the OSPF neighbors should be 'd' (20 OSPF neighbors), assuming each site includes the headquarters and the remote sites.
