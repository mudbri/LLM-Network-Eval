106,Which of the following are true about configuration verification? Select all that apply.,"a. Configuration verification can only detect errors after the configuration is installed on production routers.
b. Configuration verification cannot detect incorrect protocol behavior that may result from faulty hardware.
c. Verifying the correctness of network behavior based on configuration requires a model of protocol behavior.
d. Configuration verification requires a large-scale simulation of network protocols, complete with tests for different message orderings and timings.
e. Configuration verification cannot detect incorrect protocol behavior that may result from buggy software.
","b,c,e","b,c,e","b,c,e","Configuration verification is a process that checks whether a network's configuration aligns with the intended design and protocols. It does not necessarily require a large-scale simulation with various message orderings and timings, so option (d) is not always true. Verification can be done through various means, including static analysis or testing in a controlled environment. Let's evaluate each choice individually:

a. This statement is not entirely true because configuration verification can be performed before deployment to production routers, using simulation or modeling tools to predict and prevent errors.

b. True, configuration verification typically involves checking the correctness of the configuration settings and logic, but it does not deal with hardware issues. Therefore, it cannot detect incorrect protocol behavior that may result from faulty hardware.

c. True, to verify the correctness of network behavior based on configuration, a model of protocol behavior is necessary. This model helps in understanding how the network should operate and in identifying deviations from the expected behavior.

d. False, configuration verification does not necessarily require a large-scale simulation of network protocols. There are various methods of verification, and while some might involve simulation, it is not a requirement for all verification processes.

e. True, similar to hardware, configuration verification focuses on the correctness of the configuration settings and logic. It typically does not deal with the internal workings of software, so it cannot detect incorrect protocol behavior that may result from buggy software.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is mostly correct, but it incorrectly dismisses option (d) as not always true. While it is correct that configuration verification does not necessarily require large-scale simulation, the statement in (d) does not claim that it is a requirement, but rather that configuration verification requires such simulations, which could be interpreted as one of the methods used in the process. However, since the statement could be misleading by suggesting this is the only or primary method, it's reasonable to consider it incorrect in the context of the question, which asks for truths about configuration verification in general. The explanation for (a) is accurate in stating that verification can happen before deployment. The explanations for (b), (c), and (e) are correct in their assessment that configuration verification does not deal with hardware issues or buggy software.

107,"Which of the following assertions could be verified with configuration verification (i.e., of a snapshot of router and switch configuration)? Select all that apply.","a. A route learned from one peer will not be readvertised to another peer.
b. The current settings of link weights will result in all routers being connected.
c. The configuration of route reflectors and clients ensures that any route learned from a neighboring AS will propagate to all routers in the topology.
d. There is no traffic pattern that would ever result in a stateful firewall dropping traffic.
e. Any time that an infection occurs, hosts are automatically quarantined.
","a,b,c","a,c","a,c","Configuration verification involves examining the static configuration of network devices, like routers and switches, to ensure that they are set up correctly according to the network policies and intended design. It does not involve the dynamic state of the network or traffic patterns.

a. Verifying that a route learned from one peer will not be readvertised to another peer can be done by examining routing policies and filters in the configuration.

b. The current settings of link weights affecting connectivity is a dynamic property which can be influenced by various factors like link failures or changes in the network topology. Configuration alone cannot guarantee connectivity.

c. The configuration of route reflectors and clients can be verified by examining the BGP configuration to ensure that the appropriate BGP sessions and policies are set up to allow propagation of routes.

d. The behavior of a stateful firewall under various traffic patterns is dynamic and cannot be fully verified by static configuration alone since it depends on the state of the network traffic.

e. Whether hosts are automatically quarantined in the event of an infection involves dynamic behavior and interaction with security systems, which cannot be verified through static configuration verification alone.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is mostly correct. Configuration verification can indeed confirm certain aspects of network configuration, such as routing policies and the setup of route reflectors and clients. However, the original answer does not address option e in detail. It is important to note that while configuration verification can check if there are policies or settings in place that are intended to quarantine infected hosts, it cannot guarantee the dynamic behavior of such features in an actual infection scenario. The verification of automated responses to infections would require testing the system in a dynamic environment, not just reviewing the static configuration.

108,Which of the following are true about data-plane verification? Select all that apply.,"a. Data-plane verification techniques such as header-space analysis typically operate on a single ""snapshot"" of data-plane state.
b. Data plane verification can only operate on the forwarding table of a single router or switch; network-wide analysis is not possible.
c. Data-plane verification may detect errors that configuration analysis can miss in the cases of buggy control-plane software.
d. Data-plane verification requires accurate modeling of network protocols, including which bits are present in which part of the packet header.
e. Header-space analysis can only provide verification/analysis for specific packets; it cannot answer questions for general parts of flowspace.
","a,c","a,c,d","a,c,d,e","Data-plane verification is a technique used to ensure that the network is forwarding packets correctly according to the current configuration and state of the network devices. Here's an evaluation of each choice provided:

a. Data-plane verification techniques such as header-space analysis do indeed typically operate on a single 'snapshot' of data-plane state. This snapshot represents the state of the network at a particular point in time.

b. This statement is incorrect. Data-plane verification can be performed network-wide, not just on a single router or switch. Tools and techniques are designed to analyze the collective behavior of multiple forwarding tables across the network.

c. Data-plane verification can detect errors that configuration analysis might miss, especially in cases where the control-plane software is buggy or the network state has inconsistencies due to transient conditions or faults.

d. Accurate modeling of network protocols is necessary for data-plane verification, as it involves understanding how packets are processed and forwarded based on the bits present in the packet headers.

e. Header-space analysis is not limited to specific packets; it can analyze and verify the behavior of the network for general parts of the flow space. It works by abstracting the packet headers and analyzing the forwarding behavior for entire sets of packets that match certain header patterns.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer correctly identifies a, c, and d as true statements about data-plane verification. However, it incorrectly dismisses e as a false statement. Header-space analysis can indeed analyze general parts of the flow space, not just specific packets, as it uses a mathematical representation of the set of all possible packet headers to understand the forwarding behavior of the network.

109,Which of the following assertions could be verified with data plane verification? Select all that apply.,"a. The network will remain connected, given the failure of at most two links.
b. Two virtual network ""slices"" are not completely isolated: it is possible for traffic to travel from one slice to the other.
c. The configuration of the network's routing protocols will result in persistent oscillation (i.e., they will never settle on a stable set of routes).
d. The forwarding table state in the routers across the network will result in a forwarding loop.
e. The rules installed on the firewalls in the network ensure that only port 80 traffic can ever reach the web server from the rest of the Internet.","b,d,e","b,d","b,d,e","Data plane verification is concerned with ensuring that the actual forwarding behavior of the network matches the desired behavior according to the network's configuration. It involves checking the state of the network's forwarding tables, the rules installed on network devices like firewalls, and the actual flow of packets through the network.

a. The network's ability to remain connected given the failure of links is related to the network's control plane and its resilience or redundancy mechanisms, not the data plane.

b. Verifying whether two virtual network 'slices' are isolated can be done by analyzing the forwarding tables and firewall rules to see if there are paths that traffic can take between the slices. This is a data plane verification task.

c. The configuration of routing protocols and their convergence to a stable state is a control plane issue. Data plane verification does not deal with the dynamics of routing protocol state.

d. Checking for forwarding loops involves analyzing the forwarding tables in routers to see if packets could be sent in a loop, which is a data plane verification task.

e. Ensuring that only certain types of traffic can reach a server is related to the rules installed on the firewalls, which is part of the data plane. However, verifying that 'only port 80 traffic can ever reach the web server' involves ensuring that the network adheres to a policy, which may require both data plane and control plane verification to ensure that the rules are correctly implemented and enforced.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer is mostly correct but requires clarification for option e. 

Option a is correctly identified as a control plane issue, as it involves the network's ability to adapt to changes, such as link failures, which is beyond the scope of data plane verification.

Option b is correctly identified as a data plane verification task since it involves analyzing the actual forwarding behavior, including firewall rules and forwarding tables, to determine if isolation is maintained.

Option c is correctly excluded because it concerns the control plane, specifically the behavior of routing protocols and their ability to converge to a stable set of routes.

Option d is correctly identified as a data plane verification task, as it involves examining the forwarding tables to identify potential forwarding loops.

Option e is where the clarification is needed. While firewall rules are indeed part of the data plane and their verification is a data plane task, ensuring that 'only port 80 traffic can ever reach the web server' is a broader statement that may also involve verifying that the control plane is correctly programming those firewall rules. Therefore, while the data plane verification can confirm that the current state of the firewall rules aligns with the policy, it may not be sufficient to ensure that the policy will always be enforced under all network conditions, which could involve control plane considerations.

Correct Answers: b,d,e (with the understanding that e involves both data plane verification of the current state and may require control plane verification for complete assurance of policy enforcement)",0,0,14_verification,1.0
110,Which of the following is true about Kinetic policies? Select all that apply.,"a. State transitions can be exogenous or endogenous.
b. Kinetic's NuSMV verifier can verify that the data plane will never have loops.
c. State transitions can occur based on timing (e.g., a timeout).
d. The Kinetic controller can only process external events from routers and switches.
e. Pyretic's composition operators can help prevent state explosion.
","a,c,e","a,b,c,e","a,b,c,e","Kinetic is a framework for programming networks with stateful abstractions. Here's the analysis of each statement:

a. State transitions in Kinetic can indeed be both exogenous, triggered by external events, and endogenous, triggered by internal conditions or state changes. This is a characteristic of stateful SDN controllers.

b. One of the advantages of Kinetic is that it can use model checking tools like NuSMV to verify properties of the network, such as the absence of loops in the data plane, which is a critical safety property.

c. Kinetic policies can specify state transitions based on timing conditions, such as timeouts, which is useful for implementing features like aging out flow entries or handling transient states.

d. The Kinetic controller is not limited to processing only external events from routers and switches. It can also process internal events and maintain state across different events, which is a key feature of stateful SDN applications.

e. Pyretic, which is a network programming language, provides composition operators that can be used to build complex policies from simpler ones without causing state explosion. This is because these operators allow for modular programming, which helps manage complexity.

Therefore, options a, b, c, and e are correct, while option d is not true about Kinetic policies.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer provided a detailed explanation for each option and correctly identified a, b, c, and e as true statements about Kinetic policies. However, it mistakenly stated that option d is not true about Kinetic policies, when in fact there is no information in the question or answer that directly refutes this statement. Without specific information about the capabilities of the Kinetic controller, we cannot conclusively say that option d is false. Therefore, the evaluation of option d is potentially incorrect, depending on the actual capabilities of the Kinetic controller which are not detailed in this context.

Correct Answers: a, b, c, e

Note: The correctness of option d depends on the specific features and limitations of the Kinetic controller, which are not provided in the given context. If the Kinetic controller indeed can only process external events from routers and switches, then d would be correct. However, if the Kinetic controller can also process other types of events or inputs, then d would be incorrect. Without further information, we cannot definitively assess the accuracy of option d.",0,0,14_verification,0.6000000000000001

b. None of the above.
c. SPEC A [ policy=allow U authenticated ]
d. SPEC AG (authenticated -> AX policy=allow)
e. SPEC AG (EF policy=allow)
",e,e,e,"The given statement 'It is always possible for the policy state to go to 'allow'' is encoded in temporal logic as 'In all states, there exists a future state where the policy is allow'. In NuSMV, this is represented using the temporal operators AG (Always Globally) and EF (Exists in the Future). The correct expression that encodes this statement is 'SPEC AG (EF policy=allow)', which means that in all states (AG), it is possible (EF) to eventually reach a state where 'policy=allow'.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer correctly interprets the given statement in terms of temporal logic and NuSMV syntax. The statement ""It is always possible for the policy state to go to 'allow'"" is indeed translated to ""In all states, there exists a future state where the policy is 'allow'."" The NuSMV expression that represents this is 'SPEC AG (EF policy=allow)', which uses the AG operator to specify that the property must hold in all states, and the EF operator to specify that there exists a future state in which 'policy=allow' is true.
