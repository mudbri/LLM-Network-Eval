The original answer provides a good explanation of how to construct the Pyretic rule to match traffic from specific source IP addresses to a destination IP address. However, there is a mistake in the explanation of the logical operators used in Pyretic. The explanation states that the '+' operator is a logical AND operator, which is incorrect.

The original answer is incorrect in its explanation. While option b does use the correct syntax in Pyretic for sequencing rules, the explanation provided incorrectly states that the >> operator is used for sequencing.
