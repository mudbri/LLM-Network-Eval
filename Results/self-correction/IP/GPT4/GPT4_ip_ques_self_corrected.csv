Class B addresses have a default subnet mask of 255.255.0.0. However, it's a common practice to subnet Class B addresses to have a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, which is why option b is also considered correct in many practical scenarios. The network ID for a Class B address would be the first two octets (172.16 in this case), not 172.0.0.0 as option a suggests. The number of host bits in an unsubnetted Class B network is 16, which corresponds to the third and fourth octet (option d). However, the question does not specify whether the network is subnetted or not, so this information cannot be determined solely from the IP address given. Lastly, the broadcast address for the network would be the last address in the network or subnet range, not necessarily 172.255.255.255 as option e suggests, as this assumes a single Class B network without further subnetting.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer's choice of b and c as correct answers is partially incorrect. The IP address 172.16.99.45 indeed falls within the range of Class B addresses, which are from 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255, making option c correct. However, the default subnet mask for a Class B network is 255.255.0.0, not 255.255.255.0 as option b suggests. Therefore, option b is not correct without additional context such as whether the network has been further subnetted or not.

The network ID is not 172.0.0.0 as option a suggests; it would be 172.16.0.0 for an unsubnetted Class B network. The number of host bits in the unsubnetted network is indeed 16, which makes option d correct.

However, the answer could be misleading if the context is not about Cisco devices, as different network vendors have different command-line syntax. For example, on Juniper devices, the command would be 'show route'. Without specifying the vendor, the answer is incomplete. Additionally, the other options might be valid commands on different platforms or in different contexts, so they should not be dismissed without clarification.

In this case, the IP address 10.1.1.100 with a subnet mask of /26 (which translates to 255.255.255.192) belongs to the subnet 10.1.1.64/26.

The original answer is correct. When a router interface is configured with an IP address and subnet mask, the router's routing table will indeed include a connected route for the network to which the interface is attached and a local route for the specific IP address assigned to the interface.

The connected route is for the subnet in which the interface's IP address resides. With an IP address of 10.1.1.100 and a subnet mask of 255.255.255.192 (which corresponds to a /26 prefix length), the subnet is 10.1.1.64/26. This is because the subnet mask indicates that the first 26 bits are the network portion of the address, leaving the last 6 bits for host addresses. The range of addresses in this subnet is from 10.1.1.64 to 10.1.1.127.

The local route is for the router's own IP address with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.255. This is a host route, which is a route for a single IP address.

The answer correctly excludes option b, which incorrectly identifies 10.1.1.64 as a host address with a 255.255.255.255 mask; option d, which incorrectly gives the local route a subnet mask of 255.255.255.192; and option e, which incorrectly states that there would be a connected route for the 10.1.1.0/24 subnet, which is not the subnet the interface belongs to.

Here's an evaluation of each option:

a. Perform load balancing on any traffic that arrives from prefix 130.207.0.0/16 or is destined to port 80. - This implies that two separate conditions (traffic from a certain IP prefix and traffic destined to a certain port) are handled in parallel to determine whether load balancing should be applied. Hence, it is an example of parallel composition.

b. Perform MAC learning on all traffic that is not blocked by a firewall rule. - This describes a sequential process where MAC learning is applied only after firewall rules have been considered, which is not an example of parallel composition.

c. Count all port 80 traffic. - This is a singular action applied to traffic and does not involve parallel processes.

d. Block all traffic whose source IP address is contained in a list of blocked IP addresses. - This is another singular action that does not involve parallel processes.

e. Load balance traffic across multiple destination IP addresses and perform routing to the resulting destination IP addresses. - This option describes two actions (load balancing and routing) that are applied to the traffic in parallel, which makes it an example of parallel composition.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. Parallel composition involves executing multiple network policies or functions simultaneously. Both options a and e describe scenarios where multiple network functions are being applied to the traffic simultaneously. In option a, load balancing is performed based on two different criteria (source prefix and destination port), which can be considered parallel conditions for the application of load balancing. In option e, load balancing and routing are two distinct actions that are performed simultaneously on the traffic, fitting the definition of parallel composition.

To support 90 subnets, we need to determine how many bits are required to represent at least 90 unique values. Using the formula 2^n >= number of subnets (where n is the number of bits), we find that 2^7 = 128, which is the smallest power of 2 greater than 90. Therefore, we need 7 additional bits for subnetting. Adding these 7 bits to the original 16 bits of the Class B network, we get a subnet mask of /23 (16+7=23). However, since the question asks for a mask that can support at least 90 subnets, we can use a /21 or a /22 subnet mask, which provides even more subnets. The corresponding decimal subnet masks for /21 and /22 are 255.255.248.0 and 255.255.240.0, respectively. Option b (/21) and option e (255.255.240.0) are therefore correct. Option d (255.255.255.252) is a /30 mask which is typically used for point-to-point links, and option f (255.255.224.0) is a /19 mask which provides more subnets than required.","Evaluation of original answer:
The original answer incorrectly states that a /21 and 255.255.240.0 are correct choices for providing at least 90 subnets in a Class B network. The explanation provided is also incorrect because it mentions a /23 mask which is not one of the options and then jumps to stating that /21 and /22 are correct without explaining why /22 is not listed as an option. Additionally, the explanation incorrectly matches the /21 mask with 255.255.248.0 and the /22 mask with 255.255.240.0, which is not accurate.

In a Class B network, the default subnet mask is indeed 255.255.0.0, which corresponds to a /16 prefix length. To support at least 90 subnets, we need to calculate the number of bits required to have at least 90 unique subnet identifiers. As the original answer correctly states, 2^7 = 128, which is sufficient for 90 subnets. Therefore, we need 7 additional bits for subnetting on top of the original 16 bits, leading to a /23 subnet mask (16+7=23).

However, the correct decimal subnet mask for a /21 prefix length is 255.255.248.0, not 255.255.240.0 as stated in the original answer. The correct decimal subnet mask for a /22 prefix length is 255.255.252.0, which is not an option given. The answer also incorrectly includes option e (255.255.240.0), which corresponds to a /20 mask, not a /22 mask.

Option 'a' (9.0.0.0) is not within any of these defined private address ranges and is therefore considered a routable IP address.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. It accurately identifies the non-routable (private) IP address ranges as defined by the IANA. The explanation provided correctly matches these ranges to the appropriate CIDR notations and explains that option 'a' (9.0.0.0) is not a non-routable IP address and is indeed routable on the global internet.

28,A Layer 2 switch configuration places all its physical ports into VLAN 2. The IP addressing plan shows that address 175.28.1.150 (with mask 255.255.255.0) is reserved for use by this new LAN switch and that 175.28.1.254 is already configured on the router connected to that same VLAN. The switch needs to support SSH connections into the switch from any subnet in the network. Which of the following commands are part of the required configuration in this case? (Choose two answers.),"a. The switch cannot support SSH because all its ports connect to VLAN 2, and the IP address must be configured on interface VLAN 1.
b. The ip address 175.28.1.150 255.255.255.0 command in interface vlan 2 configuration mode.
c. The ip default-gateway 175.28.1.254 command in global configuration mode.
d. The ip address 172.16.2.250 255.255.255.0 command in interface vlan 1 configuration mode.
e. The ip default-gateway 175.28.1.150 command in global configuration mode.","b,c","b,c","b,c","In order to configure a Layer 2 switch to support SSH connections, the switch needs to have an IP address assigned to a VLAN interface for management purposes, and it should know the default gateway to reach networks that are not directly connected. Since all physical ports are in VLAN 2, the switch's management IP address should also be in VLAN 2. Therefore, the command to assign the IP address to VLAN 2 is 'ip address 175.28.1.150 255.255.255.0' in interface VLAN 2 configuration mode. Additionally, to reach other subnets, the switch must be configured with a default gateway using the 'ip default-gateway 175.28.1.254' command in global configuration mode. Option 'a' is incorrect because the IP address does not have to be on VLAN 1; it should be on the VLAN that is used for management. Option 'd' is incorrect because the IP address belongs to a different subnet. Option 'e' is incorrect because it suggests using the switch's own IP address as the default gateway, which is not valid.","Evaluation of original answer: The original answer is correct. The explanation provided is accurate and correctly addresses the question. It explains why options 'b' and 'c' are the correct choices for configuring a Layer 2 switch to support SSH connections from any subnet in the network. The answer also correctly dismisses the other options, explaining why they are not suitable for the given scenario.
