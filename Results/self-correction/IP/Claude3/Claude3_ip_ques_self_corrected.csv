The wildcard mask 0.0.255.255 is the appropriate choice to match addresses that begin with 110.20. The first two octets (110.20) are fixed, so they should have 0's in the wildcard mask. The last two octets can be any value, so they should have 255's in the wildcard mask.

The default subnet mask for the 10.0.0.0/8 network is indeed 255.0.0.0. However, this does not mean that 10.0.0.56 cannot have a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.

Correct Answer: d. The IP address 10.0.0.56 can indeed have a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. This is because the 10.0.0.0/8 network, which is a private IP address range, can be subnetted using a 255.255.255.0 subnet mask.
