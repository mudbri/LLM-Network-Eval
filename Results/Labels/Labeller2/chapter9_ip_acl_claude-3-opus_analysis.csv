163,Which of the following options are things that a standard IP ACL could be configured to do? (Choose two answers.),"a. Match the exact source IP address
b. Match all IP addresses in a subnet with one access-list command without matching other IP addresses
c. Match IP addresses 20.2.2.2 through 20.2.2.22 with one access-list command without matching other IP addresses
d. Match only the packetâ€™s destination IP address","a,b","a,d","A standard IP access control list (ACL) can match the exact source IP address of packets using a command like 'access-list 1 permit 10.1.1.1'. It can also match only the packet's destination IP address by applying the ACL to inbound traffic on an interface. However, a standard ACL cannot match a range of addresses or a subnet without also including other IP addresses, as those capabilities require an extended ACL.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1, Chapter 16: Access Control Lists (ACLs)', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/ios-firewall/23602-confaccesslists.html']",0,chapter9_ip_acl,0.95,1,,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,,,,1,1,1,,3,2,2,2,0.0
165,"Given the following fields, which of those cannot be compared on an extended IP ACL?","a. Application protocol
b. Destination IP address
c. Source IP address
d. URL
e. TOS Byte
",d,"d,e","Extended IP ACLs cannot compare URLs or the TOS byte. They can filter based on the application protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP), source IP address, and destination IP address. However, filtering based on URLs requires more advanced features like a firewall or web content filtering. The TOS (Type of Service) byte is also not a filterable field in standard extended IP ACLs.","['Cisco CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 2, Chapter 16: IP Access Control Lists', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/sec_data_acl/configuration/15-mt/sec-data-acl-15-mt-book/sec-create-ip-apply.html']",0,chapter9_ip_acl,0.95,1,,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,,,,1,1,1,,3,4,1,4,0.6

175,"The ACL 55 on R1 has four statements, in the following order, with address and wildcard mask values as follows:
1. 20.0.0.0 0.255.255.255
2. 20.20.0.0 0.0.255.255
3. 20.20.20.0 0.0.0.255
4. 2.2.2.0 0.0.0.255
If a router tried to match a packet sourced from IP address 20.20.20.20 using this ACL, which ACL statement does a router consider the packet to have matched?","a. First statement
b. Second statement
c. Third statement
d. Forth statement
e. Implied deny at the end of the ACL
",a,c,"When a router processes an ACL, it goes through the statements in sequential order from top to bottom. It stops processing and considers the packet matched at the first statement where there is a match. In this case, the IP address 20.20.20.20 would match the third statement 20.20.20.0 0.0.0.255 because the wildcard mask of 0.0.0.255 means that only the first three octets need to match exactly. The fourth octet can be anything from 0 to 255. So the router would consider this packet matched by the third ACL statement and stop processing further.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 2, by Wendell Odom, Chapter 16: Access Control Lists', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/ios-firewall/23602-confaccesslists.html']",0,chapter9_ip_acl,0.95,1,,Incorrect reasoning/deduction,An error related to misinterpreting IP addresses,,,0,,,,1,1,0,,2,3,2,1,0.199999999999999
