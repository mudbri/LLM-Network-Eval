5,On which layer are Ethernet standards and some wireless technologies operating?,"a. The network layer
b. The transport layer
c. The physical layer
d. The data link layer
",d,"c,d","Ethernet standards operate primarily on two layers of the OSI model: the physical layer and the data link layer. The physical layer (Layer 1) deals with the physical connection between devices and the transmission and reception of raw bit streams over a physical medium. It includes specifications for cables, connectors, and signaling options. The data link layer (Layer 2) is responsible for node-to-node data transfer and error checking and is where Ethernet frames are defined. Wireless technologies also operate at these layers, with physical layer specifications for radio transmission and data link layer protocols for addressing and control.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_layer', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer']",0,1_basics_computer_networking,1,0.99185217989828,,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,,,,1,1,1,,3,3,1,2,0.5
