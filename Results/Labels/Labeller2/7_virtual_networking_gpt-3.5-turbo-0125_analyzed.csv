54,Which of the following properties are characteristics of virtual networks (but not necessarily characteristics of SDN). Select all that apply.,"a. Separates the data and control plane.
b. Refactors network control so that network behavior is controlled from a single logically centralized controller.
c. Separates logical and physical networks.
d. Often deployed in data center networks to allow multiple tenants to share physical network infrastructure.
e. Abstracts the details of the physical network.
","c,d,e","c,d","Option c is correct because virtual networks separate logical and physical networks, which is a characteristic of virtualization in general and not exclusive to SDN. Option d is also correct as virtual networks are often deployed in data center networks to enable multiple tenants to share the physical network infrastructure, a feature commonly associated with virtualization technologies.",[],0,7_virtual_networking,0.9,0.739119720922863,,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,,,,1,0,0,,3,3,1,1,0.6000000000000001
56,Which of the following are true of the Mininet network emulator? Select all that apply.,"a. It requires running OpenFlow-capable switches.
b. It is difficult to use it to route traffic for real services.
c. Mininet only allows users to create three types of topologies: linear, tree, and single-switch topologies.
d. It can create an emulation that runs across multiple physically distributed nodes.
e. All of the hosts in the topology must run the same underlying operating system.

59,Which of the following functions does FlowVisor enable? Select all that apply.,"a. Allowing two different researchers to implement and deploy different load balancing applications for all traffic between the same source-destination pair.
b. Allowing two controllers to control traffic on distinct VLANs.
c. Allowing two different researchers to implement and deploy different Web load balancing applications for port 80 traffic.
d. Allowing two different researchers to implement and deploy control mechanisms for two distinct applications.
e. Allowing one controller to control TCP traffic and one controller to control UDP traffic.","b,d,e","a,c,d","FlowVisor is a software-defined networking (SDN) tool that enables network virtualization by slicing a physical network into multiple virtual networks. It allows for the isolation and management of network resources for different purposes. 

a. FlowVisor enables different researchers to implement and deploy different applications for all traffic between the same source-destination pair, ensuring isolation and control over specific flows.

b. FlowVisor does not specifically enable two controllers to control traffic on distinct VLANs. This functionality is more related to VLAN configurations and network setup.

c. FlowVisor can enable different researchers to implement and deploy different applications for specific types of traffic, such as Web load balancing applications for port 80 traffic.

d. FlowVisor allows for the implementation and deployment of control mechanisms for different applications, providing isolation and control over network resources.

e. FlowVisor does not specifically allow one controller to control TCP traffic and another controller to control UDP traffic. This level of control is typically handled within the controller logic and network application configurations.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1496091.1496100', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6254055']",0,7_virtual_networking,0.9,0.515637172654233,,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,,,,1,1,1,,3,4,3,4,0.0
61,Select the statement that is most true about the relationship between network virtualization and SDNs.,"a. Network virtualization is a potential enabler for software-defined networks, since the separation of data and control planes first requires the creation of a logical network.
b. Software-defined networking is a potential enabler for virtual networks, since separation of data and control planes makes it easier to manage a logical network topology.
c. Network virtualization is a new concept introduced by Amazon, Nicira, and industry players; it only made sense to talk about network virtualization once central SDN controllers existed.
d. Network virtualization and software-defined networking each enable the other: SDN cannot exist without network virtualization, and network virtualization cannot exist without SDN.
",b,a,"Option a is the most accurate statement. Network virtualization is indeed a potential enabler for software-defined networks because the fundamental concept of SDN involves the separation of the control plane from the data plane, which requires the creation of a logical network through network virtualization.",[],0,7_virtual_networking,0.9,0.998109091025248,,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,,,,1,1,1,,3,3,3,3,0.0
