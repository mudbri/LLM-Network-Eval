d. a method where users are required to verify their credentials through a combination of hardware and/or software. Usually a username, password, and a short-lived token.
","b,d",d,Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security process that requires users to provide two different authentication factors to verify their identity. It usually consists of something the user knows (like a username and password) and something the user has (like a hardware token or mobile app that generates a one-time code).

69,What are some use cases for reverse proxies? Select all that apply.,"a. Improved computer graphics
b. Load balancing
c. IP address translation
d. Encryption and Decryption
","b,d","b,c,d",Reverse proxies have several common use cases:b) Load balancing - A reverse proxy can distribute incoming requests across multiple backend servers to balance the load.  c) IP address translation - The reverse proxy translates the destination IP of incoming packets to the IP of the appropriate backend server. This hides the internal IP addresses.d) Encryption/Decryption - A reverse proxy can handle encryption and decryption of HTTPS traffic so the backend servers don't have to.Improved computer graphics is not a typical use case for reverse proxies.,"['https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/reverse-proxy-server/', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/']",0,4_networking_serices,0.95,1,,Misinterpreting questions,Misinterpreting a word,,,1,,,,1,1,0,,3,2,2,2,0.5
