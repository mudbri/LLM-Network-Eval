3,Which of the following are true about traffic control with BGP? Select all that apply.,"a. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
b. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
c. A network operator can use BGP AS path prepending to control outbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
d. A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control inbound traffic from his or her AS to a destination.
","a,b","a,c","A network operator can use the BGP local preference attribute to control outbound traffic from their AS to a destination. The local preference is used to prefer certain paths out of the AS over others. BGP AS path prepending can also be used to control outbound traffic by making certain paths appear longer and less preferred. However, AS path prepending is typically used to influence inbound traffic from other ASes by making paths through the operator's AS look less attractive. The local preference attribute has no impact on inbound traffic from other ASes.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross', 'BGP: Building Reliable Networks with the Border Gateway Protocol by Iljitsch van Beijnum']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1,,Incorrect reasoning/deduction,Contradictory reasoning,,,1,,,,1,1,1,,3,4,1,1,0.0
7,Which of the following are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control? Select all that apply.,"a. Only wireless networks can have collisions at the receiver; such collisions are not possible on wired Ethernet networks.
b. Using RTS/CTS (“request to send”, “clear to send”) control reduces the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network.
c. A wireless sender can avoid causing a collision at the receiver by performing a “carrier sense” to determine whether any other sender wants to transmit at the time that it wishes to send a packet.
d. Disabling RTS/CTS necessarily lowers the effective throughput of the wireless network, since more collisions will occur at the receiver without RTS/CTS enabled.
",b,"b,c","Both options b and c are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control. Using RTS/CTS does reduce overall throughput because of the additional control overhead, but it helps avoid collisions caused by hidden terminals. Performing carrier sense allows a sender to avoid colliding with other transmissions it can detect. Option a is false because collisions can occur on wired Ethernet as well. Option d is false because disabling RTS/CTS can sometimes improve throughput if the overhead of the control frames outweighs the cost of additional collisions.","['802.11 Wireless Networks: The Definitive Guide, 2nd Edition by Matthew Gast', 'Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1,,Misinterpreting questions,Misinterpreting a word,,,0,,,,1,1,0,,2,3,2,2,0.5
9,Which of the following are true about TCP? Select all that apply.,"a. TCP guarantees that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted.
b. A TCP sender and receiver use a “three-way handshake” both to set up and to terminate the TCP connection.
c. TCP’s congestion avoidance algorithm causes the sender to reduce its sending rate by a factor of two when it sees a packet loss.
d. A TCP sender controls its sending rate by adjusting the number of unacknowledged packets that can be sent over the network at any time.
","a,c,d","a,d","Options a and d are correct about TCP. TCP does guarantee that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted, providing reliable data transfer (a). TCP also uses a congestion window to control the number of unacknowledged packets that can be in transit, adjusting the sending rate (d). However, TCP uses a three-way handshake only to establish the connection, not to terminate it (b is incorrect). And while TCP does react to packet loss, it does not always reduce the sending rate by a factor of two - that depends on the specific congestion control algorithm being used (c is incorrect).","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross, Section 3.5', 'TCP congestion control - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1,,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,,,,1,1,1,,3,3,2,1,0.5
