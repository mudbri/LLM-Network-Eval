5,"Given a network address 128.100.0.0, what is its network class type? Select one choice.","a. Class A
b. Class B
c. Class C
d. None of the above
",b,a,"The network address 128.100.0.0 falls into the range of Class A addresses. Class A addresses have a first octet range of 1 to 126, but since the address space was running out, the range was expanded to include 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255. The first bit of the first octet in Class A addresses is always '0', which is true for the address 128 (10000000 in binary).","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classful_network', 'https://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv4-address-space/ipv4-address-space.xhtml']",0,TCP,0.95,0.999855469,,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,,,,1,0,1,,1,2,1,2,0
10,"Based on 1.1.1.0/24, the IP address would be: Select one choice.","a. Class A
b. Class B
c. Class C
d. Class D
",a,c,"The IP address 1.1.1.0/24 falls within the range of Class A addresses (1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255). However, the '/24' notation indicates a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, which is typically used for a Class C network. Class C networks have IP addresses ranging from 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255, but the subnet mask defines the network's class in this context. Therefore, the IP address 1.1.1.0 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 is treated as a Class C network for subnetting purposes.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classful_network', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork']",0,TCP,0.75,0.775764922,,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,,,,1,1,1,,1,2,1,2,0
19,Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) allows a diskless workstation to be remotely booted up in a network with TCP port designation for both client and server. Select one choice.,"a. True
b. False
",b,a,"Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) is indeed a protocol that allows a diskless workstation to discover its own IP address, the address of a server on the network, and a file to be loaded into memory to boot the machine. BOOTP operates on the client-server model and uses UDP, not TCP, but it does have designated port numbers for both the client and server. The client-side port is 68, and the server-side port is 67. While the question may be slightly misleading by mentioning TCP instead of UDP, the main functionality described (allowing a diskless workstation to be remotely booted up in a network) is true.","['https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc951', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_Protocol']",0,TCP,0.95,0.987327196,,Incorrect reasoning/deduction,Incorrect Choice,,,2,,,,1,1,0,,1,1,1,1,0
