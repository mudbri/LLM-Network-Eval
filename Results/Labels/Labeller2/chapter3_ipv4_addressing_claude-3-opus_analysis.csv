54,A network designer asked you how many subnets (S) bits does he need to create 100 subnets? (Type only the number),"a. 4
b. 5
c. 6
d. 7",d,b,"To determine the number of subnet bits needed for 100 subnets, we can use the formula 2^S >= number of subnets required, where S is the number of subnet bits. Solving this: 2^4 = 16 (not enough)2^5 = 32 (not enough) 2^6 = 64 (not enough)2^7 = 128 (sufficient for 100 subnets)The smallest value of S that satisfies the condition is 7. However, the question asks how many subnet bits are needed to create exactly 100 subnets. For this, 2^6 = 64 is not enough, but 2^7 = 128 is more than required. The optimal number of subnet bits is therefore 7 - 1 = 6 bits, as this will provide 2^6 = 64 subnets, with room for future growth up to 100 subnets. So the correct answer is 6 subnet bits, which corresponds to option b.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Wendell Odom, Chapter 13: Analyzing Subnet Masks']",0,chapter3_ipv4_addressing,0.95,1,,Misinterpreting questions,Quantifier issue,,,2,,,,1,1,0,,1,1,1,1,0.0
