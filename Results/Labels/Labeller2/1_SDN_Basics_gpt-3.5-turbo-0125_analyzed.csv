2,Which of the following are true about how DNS lookups work? Select all that apply.,"a. A DNS A-record query for google.com will only return a single IP address at a time.
b. An NS-record query for a DNS lookup will return the name(s) of the authoritative name server(s) for that domain.
c. If your local DNS resolver caches an NS record for google.com for multiple days, all clients who use that DNS resolver will continue using the same IP address to reach Google’s Web server until that NS record expires.
d. An MX-record query for a DNS lookup will return the IP address of the mail server for that domain.
e. All DNS PTR records are maintained by a single organization in-addr.arpa.

4,Which of the following are true about layering? Select all that apply.,"a. The network layer guarantees reliable, in-order delivery of packets.
b. The network layer has only a single protocol in widespread use today, representing what we call the “narrow waist”.
c. The transport layer uses port numbers.
d. The destination address in the link layer header is always the address of the next layer-3 node along an end-to-end IP path.","b,c","c,d","a. The statement about the network layer guaranteeing reliable, in-order delivery of packets is incorrect. This functionality is typically provided by the transport layer (e.g., TCP). b. The network layer does not have only a single protocol in widespread use today; it has multiple protocols like IPv4, IPv6, etc. c. The transport layer does use port numbers to distinguish different applications/services running on a single device. d. The destination address in the link layer header is indeed the address of the next layer-3 (network layer) node along the path.",[],0,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.999810350013183,,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,,,,1,1,1,,3,3,1,3,,,0.0
5,Which of the following are not true about packet switching? Select all that apply.,"a. Once a connection is established between two endpoints in a packet switched network, the end-to-end route cannot change, or the connection must be re-established.
b. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will always experience predictable latency.
c. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will never be dropped by intermediate nodes along the path.
d. A user of a packet switched network might occasionally get a “busy signal” if there are too many users on the network.
","a,b,c,d","a,b,c","a. This statement is not true about packet switching. In packet switching, the end-to-end route is not fixed once a connection is established. Packets can take different routes to reach the destination, and the route can change dynamically based on network conditions. 
b. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints may not always experience predictable latency. The latency can vary based on network congestion, packet prioritization, and other factors. 
c. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints can be dropped by intermediate nodes along the path, especially during periods of congestion or network failures.",[],0,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.863664065382705,,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,,,,1,0,0,,3,3,3,3,,,0.5
7,Which of the following are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control? Select all that apply.,"a. Only wireless networks can have collisions at the receiver; such collisions are not possible on wired Ethernet networks.
b. Using RTS/CTS (“request to send”, “clear to send”) control reduces the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network.
c. A wireless sender can avoid causing a collision at the receiver by performing a “carrier sense” to determine whether any other sender wants to transmit at the time that it wishes to send a packet.
d. Disabling RTS/CTS necessarily lowers the effective throughput of the wireless network, since more collisions will occur at the receiver without RTS/CTS enabled.
",b,c,"Option c is correct. In 802.11 wireless medium access control, a wireless sender can indeed avoid causing a collision at the receiver by performing a 'carrier sense' to check if any other sender wants to transmit at that time. This process helps in reducing collisions and improving efficiency in wireless communication. Options a, b, and d are incorrect. Option a is false as collisions can occur in both wired and wireless networks. Option b is false because while RTS/CTS adds some overhead, it helps in reducing collisions and can improve throughput in certain scenarios. Option d is also false because disabling RTS/CTS does not necessarily lead to lower throughput; it depends on the network environment and traffic patterns.",['https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/carrier-sense.htm'],0,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.992255297457256,,Misinterpreting questions,"Quantifier issue,   Incorrect information/concept",,,0,,,,1,1,1,,3,3,2,3,,,0.0
9,Which of the following are true about TCP? Select all that apply.,"a. TCP guarantees that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted.
b. A TCP sender and receiver use a “three-way handshake” both to set up and to terminate the TCP connection.
c. TCP’s congestion avoidance algorithm causes the sender to reduce its sending rate by a factor of two when it sees a packet loss.
d. A TCP sender controls its sending rate by adjusting the number of unacknowledged packets that can be sent over the network at any time.

10,Which of the following are true about denial of service attacks (and defenses)? Select all that apply.,"a. If every network on the Internet performed stateless ingress filtering to defend against source IP spoofing, the DNS reflection attack would not work.
b. If every network on the Internet performed stateless egress filtering to defend against source IP address spoofing, the DNS reflection attack could not be carried out.
c. In a “SYN Flood” attack, each TCP SYN packet that a victim receives causes it to set up TCP connection state.
d. A “DNS Reflection” attack requires the attacking client to “spoof” the source IP address of the packet containing the DNS request.
","b,c,d","a,d","a. If every network on the Internet performed stateless ingress filtering to defend against source IP spoofing, the DNS reflection attack would not work: This statement is true. In a DNS reflection attack, the attacker spoofs the source IP address, making it appear as if the DNS request is coming from the victim's IP address. If ingress filtering is in place, packets with spoofed source IP addresses would be dropped, preventing the attack. d. A 'DNS Reflection' attack requires the attacking client to 'spoof' the source IP address of the packet containing the DNS request: This statement is also true. DNS reflection attacks rely on spoofing the source IP address to direct the response to the victim's IP address, causing a denial of service.",[],0,1_SDN_Basics,0.9,0.474792329974969,,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,,,,1,0,1,,3,3,2,3,,,0.0
