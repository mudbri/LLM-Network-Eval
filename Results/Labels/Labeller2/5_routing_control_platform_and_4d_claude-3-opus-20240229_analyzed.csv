33,Which of the following are true about the RCP? Select all that apply.,"a. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, the RCP controller for an AS sees all routes for all destinations that an AS learns from neighboring ASes.
b. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, there is no need for ASes to use BGP to exchange routes.
c. In an RCP deployment, routers no longer have to compute routes.
d. The RCP controller operates just like a route reflector would, selecting a single best route for each destination for all client routers.
e. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, a single AS can benefit from deploying RCP even if no other ASes deploy RCP.","c,e","a,c,e","In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, the RCP controller for an AS sees all routes for all destinations that the AS learns from neighboring ASes (a). The routers in the AS no longer have to compute routes, as this is handled by the RCP controller (c). A single AS can benefit from deploying RCP in Phase 1 even if no other ASes deploy RCP, as it improves routing within the AS (e). However, in Phase 1, ASes still need to use BGP to exchange routes with each other (b is incorrect). The RCP controller does not operate like a route reflector, as it computes and distributes routes to all routers rather than just reflecting routes (d is incorrect).","['Caesar, M., Caldwell, D., Feamster, N., Rexford, J., Shaikh, A., & van der Merwe, J.

34,"Which of the following are true about network management with BGP, in the absence of RCP? Select all that apply.","a. BGP's interaction with the underlying routing IGP routing protocol can result in persistent forwarding loops.
b. Implementing network-wide policy sometimes causes the routers themeselves to have to carry state.
c. Each router operates and makes decisions based only on a local view of network state.
d. BGP routing has a single point of failure.
e. It is not possible to perform traffic engineering with conventional BGP.
","a,b,c","b,c","In the absence of RCP, network management with BGP has the following characteristics:b) Implementing network-wide policy sometimes requires the routers themselves to maintain state in order to enforce the policy across the network.  c) With BGP, each router operates based on its own local view of the network state, without a centralized global view. It makes routing decisions independently using the information exchanged with its peers.Choices a, d, and e are incorrect:a) While suboptimal routing can occur due to interaction between BGP and the IGP, persistent forwarding loops are unlikely as BGP has loop prevention mechanisms.d) BGP is distributed, so there is no single point of failure. If one BGP router fails, others can still exchange routing information.e) Traffic engineering is possible with BGP by using techniques like AS path prepending, MED, or communities to influence path selection.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition, by Kurose and Ross', 'BGP: Building Reliable Networks with the Border Gateway Protocol, by Iljitsch van Beijnum']",0,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.8,1,,Incorrect reasoning/deduction,Incorrect calculation or counting,,,2,,,,1,1,1,,1,1,1,1,,0.6

","c,d,e","a,c,d,e","The 4D architecture aims to simplify the control plane to achieve several goals: improved security through a logically centralized control plane; simpler management systems by separating the decision logic from the underlying routers and switches; faster innovation by enabling control plane programmability; and simpler routers and switches by moving control functionality to the centralized control plane.

38,What are some examples of how a separate decision plane in the 4D architecture can amortize system overhead? Select all that apply.,"a. Maintaining a single table in memory of AS paths that are learned across all BGP sessions in the AS, and using references into that table for specific routers (and routing decisions), to save memory.
b. If secure BGP were deployed, verifying the signatures on the AS paths of routes received from neighbors.

e. Performing inbound traffic engineering on a set of links in a coordinated fashion.
