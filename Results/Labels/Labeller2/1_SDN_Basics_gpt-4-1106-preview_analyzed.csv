1,Which of the following are true about Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)? Select all that apply.,"a. The only sizes for an IP address allocation before CIDR were 8, 16, or 24 bits.
b. The prefix length for a CIDR prefix can be anywhere in the range from 0 to 32 bits.
c. In an Internet forwarding table with CIDR, there can only be one unique matching entry for any given IP address.
d. CIDR slowed the rate of Internet routing table growth because prefixes no longer had to be allocated in fixed-size blocks.","b,d","b,c,d","Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) was introduced to improve the allocation of IP addresses and decrease the size of routing tables on the Internet. Here's the analysis of each choice:

a. This statement is incorrect. Before CIDR, IP address allocation was based on classful network design, which used class A (8-bit prefix), class B (16-bit prefix), and class C (24-bit prefix) network allocations, but there were also class D (for multicast) and class E (reserved for future use or research and development). CIDR replaced this classful system with a more flexible classless system.

b. This statement is true. CIDR allows for a prefix length anywhere between 0 and 32 bits, which means that network allocations can be much more granular, allowing for a more efficient use of IP address space.

c. This statement is true. CIDR ensures that in a forwarding table, each IP address can match only one unique entry, which is the longest prefix match. This is a fundamental principle of IP routing.

d. This statement is true. By allowing for arbitrary-length subnet masks, CIDR enables the allocation of IP addresses in more flexible block sizes, which has slowed the growth of routing tables compared to the fixed-size blocks required by the classful addressing scheme.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing', 'https://www.arin.net/resources/guide/cidr/', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.95207390941896,,Misinterpreting questions,Misinterpreting a word,,,0,,,,1,1,0,,2,3,1,1,0.5
2,Which of the following are true about how DNS lookups work? Select all that apply.,"a. A DNS A-record query for google.com will only return a single IP address at a time.
b. An NS-record query for a DNS lookup will return the name(s) of the authoritative name server(s) for that domain.
c. If your local DNS resolver caches an NS record for google.com for multiple days, all clients who use that DNS resolver will continue using the same IP address to reach Google’s Web server until that NS record expires.
d. An MX-record query for a DNS lookup will return the IP address of the mail server for that domain.
e. All DNS PTR records are maintained by a single organization in-addr.arpa.
",b,"b,d","a. This statement is incorrect. A DNS A-record query for a domain like google.com can return multiple IP addresses, not just a single IP address. This is because large websites often use load balancing to distribute traffic among several servers.

b. This statement is correct. An NS (Name Server) record query returns the name(s) of the authoritative name server(s) for the specified domain. These are the servers that have the definitive information about the domain's resources.

c. This statement is misleading. While it is true that a DNS resolver may cache an NS record, the NS record itself does not determine the IP address clients use to reach a web server. Instead, it points to the authoritative name servers. The A or AAAA records returned by the authoritative name servers are what provide the actual IP addresses for the web server, and these can change independently of the NS record.

d. This statement is correct. An MX (Mail Exchange) record query returns information about the mail server responsible for handling email for the domain, but it returns the domain name of the mail server, not the IP address directly. However, this domain name can then be resolved to an IP address through an additional DNS query (typically an A or AAAA record).

e. This statement is incorrect. PTR records, which are used for reverse DNS lookups, are not maintained by a single organization. They are distributed across the various owners of IP addresses. The in-addr.arpa domain is used for IPv4 reverse DNS lookups, but the responsibility for maintaining PTR records within this domain is delegated to the entities that control the IP addresses.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_DNS', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_server', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MX_record', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_DNS_lookup']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.972131713780936,,Incorrect reasoning/deduction,Incorrect Choice,,,2,,,,1,1,0,,1,2,1,1,0.6
5,Which of the following are not true about packet switching? Select all that apply.,"a. Once a connection is established between two endpoints in a packet switched network, the end-to-end route cannot change, or the connection must be re-established.
b. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will always experience predictable latency.
c. Traffic running over a packet-switched network between two endpoints will never be dropped by intermediate nodes along the path.
d. A user of a packet switched network might occasionally get a “busy signal” if there are too many users on the network.
","a,b,c,d","a,b,c","Packet switching is a digital networking communications method that groups all transmitted data into suitably sized blocks, called packets. The characteristics of packet switching include the following:

a. Packet switched networks allow the route between two endpoints to change dynamically based on network conditions, congestion, and other factors. There is no fixed path that remains constant throughout the connection, and the packets can take different paths to reach the destination.

b. Because packets can take different paths and because the network can experience variable congestion, latency in a packet-switched network is not predictable. It can vary from packet to packet and is subject to change over time.

c. In packet-switched networks, packets can indeed be dropped by intermediate nodes if there is congestion, errors, or other issues that prevent the packet from being forwarded. This is why protocols like TCP include mechanisms for retransmission of lost packets.

d. The statement about a 'busy signal' is more akin to circuit-switched networks, where a dedicated circuit is required for a connection. However, in packet-switched networks, a user might experience congestion or reduced performance when the network is heavily utilized, but not a 'busy signal' in the traditional sense. Therefore, this statement does not reflect an incorrect aspect of packet switching and is not included as a correct choice for this question.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching', 'https://www.techopedia.com/definition/2603/packet-switching', 'https://www.lifewire.com/packet-switching-817466']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.997230544363469,,Incorrect reasoning/deduction,Incorrect Choice,,,2,,,,1,1,0,,1,2,1,1,0.5
6,Which of the following are true about content distribution networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Content distribution networks can improve the performance that a client sees by reducing the network latency between the client and the content that it is downloading.
b. Content distribution networks can reduce transit expenses for a content provider by enabling much of the provider’s content to be served from a nearby network, sometimes even from a cache that is within the client’s own network.
c. Real-time content such as video streams cannot be distributed from a content distribution network.
d. Content distribution networks typically redirect Web clients to a nearby Web cache by rewriting the IP address of packets sent from the client to the IP address of the nearby Web cache.
","a,b","a,b,d","Content distribution networks (CDNs) are designed to improve the delivery of web content and rich media to users. Here's an analysis of each choice provided:

a. True. CDNs store cached content at edge servers that are geographically closer to the user, which reduces the distance data has to travel, thereby reducing latency and improving performance.

b. True. By serving content from locations closer to the end-users, CDNs can reduce the amount of data that travels across expensive long-haul internet links, which can lower transit costs for content providers.

c. False. Real-time content such as video streams can indeed be distributed via CDNs. CDNs are widely used for streaming video services because they can handle the large amount of data and high bandwidth requirements, providing a better user experience.

d. True, but the explanation is slightly off. CDNs typically redirect clients to a nearby cache using DNS resolution, where the DNS server responds with the IP address of the closest cache server, rather than rewriting IP packets. The end result is that clients are directed to a nearby web cache, which is the essential point of this option.

Given the explanations above, options a, b, and d are correct statements about CDNs, while option c is incorrect.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/', 'https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/features/']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.999996036672654,,Incorrect reasoning/deduction,Incorrect Choice,,,2,,,,1,1,1,,1,3,1,2,0.5
7,Which of the following are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control? Select all that apply.,"a. Only wireless networks can have collisions at the receiver; such collisions are not possible on wired Ethernet networks.
b. Using RTS/CTS (“request to send”, “clear to send”) control reduces the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network.
c. A wireless sender can avoid causing a collision at the receiver by performing a “carrier sense” to determine whether any other sender wants to transmit at the time that it wishes to send a packet.
d. Disabling RTS/CTS necessarily lowers the effective throughput of the wireless network, since more collisions will occur at the receiver without RTS/CTS enabled.
",b,"b,c","Let's evaluate each statement:

a. This statement is not true. Collisions can occur on both wireless and wired Ethernet networks. In wired networks, especially those using the CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) protocol, collisions are detected and managed. Wireless networks use CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) to reduce the chances of collision.

b. Using RTS/CTS does introduce additional overhead, which can reduce the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network. This is because the RTS/CTS exchange takes time and bandwidth that could otherwise be used for data transmission.

c. A wireless sender can indeed perform a 'carrier sense' to check if the medium is free before attempting to transmit. This is part of the CSMA/CA protocol and helps to avoid collisions at the receiver.

d. Disabling RTS/CTS does not necessarily lower the effective throughput of the wireless network. While it is true that RTS/CTS can help prevent collisions, it also adds overhead. In environments where the likelihood of collision is low, disabling RTS/CTS might actually improve throughput by eliminating this overhead.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-sense_multiple_access_with_collision_avoidance', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-sense_multiple_access_with_collision_detection', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.999868981480026,,Misinterpreting questions,Misinterpreting a word,,,0,,,,1,1,0,,2,3,1,2,0.5
9,Which of the following are true about TCP? Select all that apply.,"a. TCP guarantees that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted.
b. A TCP sender and receiver use a “three-way handshake” both to set up and to terminate the TCP connection.
c. TCP’s congestion avoidance algorithm causes the sender to reduce its sending rate by a factor of two when it sees a packet loss.
d. A TCP sender controls its sending rate by adjusting the number of unacknowledged packets that can be sent over the network at any time.
","a,c,d","a,b,c,d","All the given statements about TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) are true. a. TCP does guarantee that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted, ensuring reliable data transfer. b. TCP uses a three-way handshake to establish a connection (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) and a modified version of it to terminate the connection (FIN, ACK, FIN-ACK, ACK). c. TCP's congestion avoidance algorithm, such as TCP Tahoe and TCP Reno, typically reduces the congestion window (sending rate) by half upon detecting packet loss, which is often interpreted as a signal of network congestion. d. TCP uses a flow control mechanism, which includes controlling the number of unacknowledged packets (congestion window) that can be in transit at any time, to manage the sending rate.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.807494757876666,,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,,,,1,1,0,,2,3,1,1,0.5
10,Which of the following are true about denial of service attacks (and defenses)? Select all that apply.,"a. If every network on the Internet performed stateless ingress filtering to defend against source IP spoofing, the DNS reflection attack would not work.
b. If every network on the Internet performed stateless egress filtering to defend against source IP address spoofing, the DNS reflection attack could not be carried out.
c. In a “SYN Flood” attack, each TCP SYN packet that a victim receives causes it to set up TCP connection state.
d. A “DNS Reflection” attack requires the attacking client to “spoof” the source IP address of the packet containing the DNS request.
","b,c,d","a,c,d","Let's evaluate each statement:

a. Stateless ingress filtering is a technique where routers check incoming packets to ensure that they have a source IP address that matches the network they are coming from. If every network performed such filtering, spoofed packets would be dropped, making it difficult to carry out attacks such as DNS reflection, which rely on spoofing the source IP address to direct the response to the victim. Hence, this statement is true.

b. Egress filtering is the process of monitoring and potentially restricting the flow of outbound traffic. While important for a network's security, egress filtering on its own wouldn't prevent DNS reflection attacks, as these involve incoming responses to spoofed requests. Therefore, this statement is not entirely accurate in the context of preventing DNS reflection attacks.

c. In a SYN Flood attack, the attacker sends a succession of SYN requests to a target's system in an attempt to consume enough server resources to make the system unresponsive to legitimate traffic. Each SYN packet indeed causes the server to allocate resources for a TCP connection, which can be exhausted. Thus, this statement is true.

d. A DNS Reflection attack involves the attacker sending a DNS query with a spoofed source IP address (which is the victim's IP). The DNS server then sends the response to the spoofed address, effectively using the DNS server to amplify the attack on the victim. Spoofing the source IP is a crucial step in this attack. Therefore, this statement is true.","['https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-015', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/syn-flood-ddos-attack/', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/dns-amplification-ddos-attack/']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,0.992676003584307,,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,,,,1,1,1,,3,3,2,3,0.0
