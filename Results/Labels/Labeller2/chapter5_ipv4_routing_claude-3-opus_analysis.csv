92,"A LAN design uses a Layer 3 EtherChannel between two switches SW1 and SW2, with port-channel interface 1 used on both switches. SW1 uses ports G0/1 and G0/2 in the channel. However, only interface G0/1 is bundled into the channel and working. Think about the configuration settings on port G0/2 that could have existed before adding G0/2 to the EtherChannel. Which answers identify a setting that could prevent IOS from adding G0/2 to the Layer 3 EtherChannel? (Choose two answers.)","a. A different STP cost (spanning-tree cost value)
b. A different access VLAN (switchport access vlan vlanid)
c. A different speed (speed value)
d. A default setting for switchport (switchport)
","c,d","b,d","The correct answers are b and d. For a Layer 3 EtherChannel, the physical interfaces must not be configured as switchports (Layer 2 ports). If interface G0/2 was previously configured with the 'switchport' command (answer d) or assigned to a different access VLAN with 'switchport access vlan' (answer b), it would be operating as a Layer 2 port and could not join the Layer 3 EtherChannel. The STP cost (answer a) and interface speed (answer c) do not impact an interface's ability to join a Layer 3 EtherChannel.","['Cisco Press CCNP and CCIE Enterprise Core ENCOR 350-401 Official Cert Guide, Chapter 6: IP Routing Essentials', 'Cisco Community - EtherChannel Configuration: https://community.cisco.com/t5/networking-documents/etherchannel-configuration-best-practices/ta-p/3116152']",0,chapter5_ipv4_routing,0.95,1,,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,,,,1,1,1,,3,4,2,4,0
