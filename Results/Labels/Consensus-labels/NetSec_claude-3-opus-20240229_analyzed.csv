4,Which TCP flag must be set in a packet in order for the packet to match an ACL entry that contains the established keyword? Select one choice.,"a. SYN only
b. ACK only
c. RST only
d. SYN or ACK
e. ACK or RST
",e,b,"The 'established' keyword in an ACL entry matches TCP packets that have the ACK flag set. This indicates that the packet belongs to an established TCP connection, i.e., a connection that has completed the three-way handshake. The SYN flag is used in the initial connection establishment, while the RST flag is used to reset a connection. Therefore, for a packet to match an ACL entry with the 'established' keyword, it must have the ACK flag set.","['Cisco Networking Academy: Introduction to Networks v7.0 - Chapter 7: Access Control Lists', ""Cisco IOS Security Command Reference: 'access-list (IP extended)' command description""]",0,NetSec,0.95,1,RST flag is also used to indicate that a tcp connection is already established.

29,Which two techniques would an attacker apply so that a client sends packets to the wrong gateway? (Choose two.),"a. Reflection
b. ICMP redirect
c. DNS spoofing
d. ARP poisoning
","b,d","c,d","An attacker could use DNS spoofing and ARP poisoning to make a client send packets to the wrong gateway. DNS spoofing involves providing false DNS information to redirect a client to a malicious site or server, which could act as the wrong gateway. ARP poisoning involves sending fake ARP messages to associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP of the legitimate gateway, causing the client to send packets to the attacker instead of the real gateway. Reflection and ICMP redirect would not directly cause a client to use the wrong gateway.","['https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/dns-spoofing/', 'https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/arp-spoofing/']",0,NetSec,0.95,1,"DNS spoofing could redirect a client to a wrong IP address but not specifically to a wrong gateway.
