79,Which of the following best describes protocol independence?,"a. The ability to configure a packet parser in hardware that is agnostic to (and not constrained by) the control protocol.
b. The ability to evolve an existing control protocol without breaking interoperability.
c. The ability to run a switch independently from the controller.
d. The ability to support multiple protocols running in parallel on the same hardware.
e. The ability to run a network with both legacy OpenFlow switches and switches that support custom packet processing.
",a,"a,d","Protocol independence refers to the ability to configure a packet parser in hardware that is agnostic to (and not constrained by) the control protocol (option a). This allows the hardware to process packets without being tied to a specific control protocol. Additionally, protocol independence also involves the ability to support multiple protocols running in parallel on the same hardware (option d), enabling flexibility and interoperability in a Software Defined Networking (SDN) environment.",[],0,11_protocol_independent_forwarding,0.9,0.857655332992604,Misinterpreting questions.
