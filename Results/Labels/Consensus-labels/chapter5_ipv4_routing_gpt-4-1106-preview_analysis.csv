92,"A LAN design uses a Layer 3 EtherChannel between two switches SW1 and SW2, with port-channel interface 1 used on both switches. SW1 uses ports G0/1 and G0/2 in the channel. However, only interface G0/1 is bundled into the channel and working. Think about the configuration settings on port G0/2 that could have existed before adding G0/2 to the EtherChannel. Which answers identify a setting that could prevent IOS from adding G0/2 to the Layer 3 EtherChannel? (Choose two answers.)","a. A different STP cost (spanning-tree cost value)
b. A different access VLAN (switchport access vlan vlanid)
c. A different speed (speed value)
d. A default setting for switchport (switchport)
","c,d","b,c","For a port to join an EtherChannel successfully, the settings on the port must be consistent with the other ports in the EtherChannel. If there is a mismatch in the configuration, the port will not be bundled into the EtherChannel. Specifically, all ports in the EtherChannel must operate at the same speed and duplex settings (option 'c'), and they must be configured for the same VLAN or be in the same trunking mode if they are switch ports. An access VLAN mismatch (option 'b') would prevent an interface from being added to an EtherChannel. The STP cost (option 'a') does not need to be the same for the interfaces to join an EtherChannel, and the 'switchport' command (option 'd') is used to configure a Layer 2 port, while the question specifies a Layer 3 EtherChannel, so the default setting for 'switchport' would not apply.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-6500-series-switches/12023-4.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750/software/release/12-2_55_se/configuration/guide/scg3750/swethchl.html']",0,chapter5_ipv4_routing,0.9,0.711354290360382,"1.
