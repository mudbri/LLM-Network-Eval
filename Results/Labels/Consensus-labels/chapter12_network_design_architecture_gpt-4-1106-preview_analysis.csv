211,Your company plans to start using public cloud service and now you are considering different WAN options. Your main concern is security by keeping the data private while also providing good QoS services. Which of the following options are under consideration? (Choose two answers.),"a. Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider
b. Using an Internet connection without VPN
c. Using an Internet connection with VPN
d. Using an intercloud exchange
","a,d","a,c","When considering the use of public cloud services with a focus on security and QoS, the following options are viable: a) Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider. This option, often referred to as a direct connect service provided by cloud vendors, establishes a private connection between the data center and the cloud provider, ensuring data privacy and potentially better QoS. c) Using an Internet connection with VPN. A VPN (Virtual Private Network) creates a secure, encrypted connection over the Internet, which helps in keeping the data private while utilizing the public Internet infrastructure. While QoS can be more challenging to enforce over the public Internet, VPNs can still provide a level of traffic management and prioritization.","['https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/', 'https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/vpn/concepts/overview', 'https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction']",0,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.9,0.999998420739247,Identifies that VLAN would not be good for QoS but still selects it (reasoning error).

213,"A company uses a Metro Ethernet WAN with an Ethernet LAN (E-LAN) service, with the company headquarters plus 20 remote sites connected to the service. The enterprise uses OSPF at all sites, with one router connected to the service from each site. Which of the following are true about the Layer 3 details most likely used with this service and design? (Choose all that apply)","a. The WAN uses one IP subnet
b. The WAN uses 20 or more IP subnets
c. A remote site router would have one OSPF neighbor
d. A remote site router would have 20 OSPF neighbors","a,d","a,c","In a Metro Ethernet E-LAN service, all sites appear to be on the same Ethernet network, which allows for a single IP subnet to be used across the WAN. This is because E-LAN service provides full-mesh connectivity between all locations, mimicking a LAN over a metropolitan area. Therefore, option 'a' is correct. Since all sites seem to be on the same LAN, each router would only need to form an OSPF adjacency with the headquarters router, not with every other site's router. This means a remote site router would typically have one OSPF neighbor, which is the headquarters router that appears to be on the same LAN segment, making option 'c' also correct. Options 'b' and 'd' are incorrect because they suggest a point-to-point or hub-and-spoke topology, which is not how an E-LAN service operates.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Enterprise/WAN_and_MAN/EME.html', 'https://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=680824&seqNum=2', 'https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2328.txt (OSPF Specification)']",0,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.9,0.997140708522716,"Misinterprets the context, not all routers are connected to the headquarters.
