8,Which device can be used to create logical network segments and improve network performance by reducing network congestion? Choose only one.,"a. Network switch
b. Router
c. Modem
d. Repeater
",a,b,"A router is a device that can be used to create logical network segments and improve network performance by reducing network congestion. Routers operate at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model and use IP addresses to make forwarding decisions. By dividing a network into multiple subnets or segments, routers can isolate traffic and reduce the overall network traffic, thereby improving performance and reducing congestion.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1 by Wendell Odom', 'Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach by James Kurose and Keith Ross']",0,Computer_Networking,0.95,1,"While many routers provide the functionality that switches do, they actually have different purposes.

c. Six-layer model
d. Seven-layer model
",a,d,"The DoD model, which stands for the Department of Defense model, is commonly known as the seven-layer model. It is a reference model that defines a networking framework for implementing protocols in seven layers. The seven layers, from top to bottom, are: Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, and Physical.","['Forouzan, B. A. (2013). Data Communications and Networking (5th ed.).

12,Which device can be used to connect two or more network segments together and extend the reach of a network? Choose only one.,"a. Network switch
b. Router
c. Modem
d. Bridge
",d,b,"A router is a device that can be used to connect two or more network segments together and extend the reach of a network. Routers operate at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model and are responsible for forwarding packets between different networks based on IP addresses. They maintain routing tables to determine the best path for data to travel from source to destination. By connecting multiple routers, the network can be extended over a larger geographical area.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1 by Wendell Odom, Chapter 1: Introduction to TCP/IP Networking', 'Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach by James Kurose and Keith Ross, Chapter 4: The Network Layer']",0,Computer_Networking,0.95,1,Router connects different networks,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,2,"book, book",2,1,1,0,Basic networking,3,3,3,3,0
