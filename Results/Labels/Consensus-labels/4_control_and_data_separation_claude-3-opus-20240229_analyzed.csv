23,Which of the following are examples of control plane operations? Select all that apply.,"a. Rate-limiting traffic so that the overall sending rate does not exceed a certain throughput.
b. Determining that a user's MAC address is authentic before allowing it to send traffic on the network.
c. Load balancing traffic across two output ports based on the hash of each packet's source IP address.
d. Determining the forwarding path that satisfies an access control policy.
e. Computing a shortest path routing tree.
","b,d,e","d,e","Control plane operations involve making decisions about how to handle network traffic. This includes tasks like authentication, routing, and access control. Of the given choices, determining the forwarding path that satisfies an access control policy (d) and computing a shortest path routing tree (e) are control plane operations. They involve making high-level decisions about traffic handling. The other choices - rate limiting (a), MAC authentication (b), and load balancing (c) - are data plane operations that enforce the policies set by the control plane on a per-packet basis.","['Software Defined Networks: A Comprehensive Approach by Paul Goransson and Chuck Black, Chapter 2: The Genesis of SDN', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-is-sdn-control-plane/', 'https://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2995746&seqNum=2']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.95,1,Reasoning error since authentication and access control is accepted to be a control plane operation in the explanation,Incorrect reasoning/deduction,Contradictory reasoning,,,0,1,book,1.0,1,0,1,Advanced networking,2,3,1,2,,0.6
26,What are some example network management applications that become easier with control and data plane separation? Select all that apply.,"a. Improved interdomain routing security.
b. Customer-controlled egress selection.
c. Improved logging capabilities.
d. Planned maintenance of an edge router.
e. Forecasting of network capacity.
","a,b,d","b,d","With the separation of control and data planes in SDN, certain network management tasks become easier. Customer-controlled egress selection (b) is simplified because the control plane can make forwarding decisions based on customer policies without needing to modify the data plane. Planned maintenance of an edge router (d) is also easier because the control plane can proactively reroute traffic away from the router to be serviced without impacting the data plane. While SDN may provide some benefits for the other options, they are not as directly enabled by control and data plane separation.","['Software Defined Networks: A Comprehensive Approach by Paul Goransson and Chuck Black', 'SDN: Software Defined Networks by Thomas D.

27,What are some of the motivations for using Layer-2 forwarding in a data center? Select all that apply.,"a. Ability to use existing routing protocols to establish paths between hosts.
b. Easier configuration/administration, since there is no need to number hosts or configure subnets.
c. Better security properties.
d. Better scaling properties.
e. Better load balancing properties.
",b,"b,d","The main motivations for using Layer-2 forwarding in a data center are:b) Easier configuration and administration, since there is no need to assign IP addresses to hosts or configure IP subnets. With Layer-2 forwarding, hosts can be plugged in and communicate without additional IP-level configuration.  d) Better scaling properties. Layer-2 forwarding allows for larger Layer-2 domains and avoids the need for large IP routing tables. This can improve scalability, especially in large data centers with many hosts.","['Software Defined Networking (SDN) Lecture Notes, Prof. Nick Feamster, University of Chicago', ""Data Center Networking, Dinesh G.

28,How does the separation of the control and data plane make networking in data centers easier?,"a. Virtual machines can be migrated within the network without renumbering entire portions of the network or re-assigning network services to different IP addresses.
b. The control plane allows traffic to be forwarded using Layer 2 addresses, thus allowing automatic load balance across the topology.
c. The separation allows fewer switches to be used in the data center topology, thus lowering costs.
d. All routes can be controlled and monitored from a central point of control.
e. A network controller can permit the renumbering of end hosts to have topology-dependent Layer 2 MAC addresses.","a,d,e","a,d","Separating the control and data planes in a data center network enables easier management and flexibility. It allows virtual machines to be migrated within the network without the need to renumber network segments or re-assign services to new IP addresses (a). This is because the control plane can manage the network topology and addressing separately from the data plane forwarding. Additionally, having a logically centralized control plane allows all routes to be controlled and monitored from a single point (d), simplifying network operations and troubleshooting.","['Software Defined Data Center Networking: Principles and Practice, Rajesh Kumar, Apress, 2020', 'Software Defined Networks: A Comprehensive Approach, Paul Goransson, Chuck Black, Morgan Kaufmann, 2016']",0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.9,1,Just missing information,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,1,book,1.0,1,1,0,Advanced networking,3,3,3,3,,0.6
