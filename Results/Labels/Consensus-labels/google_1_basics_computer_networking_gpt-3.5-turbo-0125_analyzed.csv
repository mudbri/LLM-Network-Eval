9,Which of these is a server?,"a. A device operating on the data link layer that connects many devices together and inspects ethernet protocol data
b. A device that forwards data between multiple networks
c. Something receiving data from something providing data
d. Something providing data to something requesting the data
",d,b,"Option b correctly describes a server as a device that forwards data between multiple networks. Servers in computer networking are devices or software applications that serve data or services to other devices, known as clients, over a network.",[],0,1_basics_computer_networking,0.9,0.98330852642402,This is a reasoning error because the definition of server given is correct but the selected option is incorrect,Incorrect reasoning/deduction,Faulty inference,,,1,,,,1,0,1,Basic networking,2,2,1,2,0
19,Which of the following are ways for transmitting data at the Ethernet level? (Select all that apply),"a. Multicast
b. Duplex
c. Broadcast
d. Unicast
","a,c,d","b,c,d","At the Ethernet level, data can be transmitted using duplex communication, broadcast, and unicast methods. 
- Multicast (option a) is a method of transmitting data to a group of devices, not specifically at the Ethernet level. 
- Duplex (option b) refers to the mode of communication where data can be transmitted and received simultaneously, which is a common way of transmitting data at the Ethernet level. 
- Broadcast (option c) involves sending data to all devices on the network, which is a method used at the Ethernet level. 
- Unicast (option d) is a one-to-one communication method, also commonly used for transmitting data at the Ethernet level.",[],0,1_basics_computer_networking,0.9,0.690598826266626,"Missing information.
