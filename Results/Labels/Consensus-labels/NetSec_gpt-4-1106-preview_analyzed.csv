4,Which TCP flag must be set in a packet in order for the packet to match an ACL entry that contains the established keyword? Select one choice.,"a. SYN only
b. ACK only
c. RST only
d. SYN or ACK
e. ACK or RST
",e,b,"The 'established' keyword in Access Control Lists (ACLs) is used to allow return traffic from a session that was initiated from the 'inside' of a network. For TCP traffic, this generally means matching packets that are part of an existing connection. The most common flag that signifies a packet is part of an established connection is the ACK flag. The SYN flag is used to initiate connections, not to identify established ones. The RST flag is used to reset connections and does not necessarily indicate an established connection. Therefore, the correct answer is that the ACK flag must be set for a packet to match an ACL entry containing the 'established' keyword.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/ios-firewall/23602-confaccesslists.html#anc13', 'https://www.practicalnetworking.net/stand-alone/acl-estab/']",0,NetSec,0.95,0.99999325020878,RST flag is also used to indicate that a tcp connection is already established.
