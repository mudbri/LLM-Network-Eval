62,Which of the following are true of “network slicing”? Select all that apply.,"a. Network operators can use slicing to test configurations on “shadow” networks that mirror a production network topology.
b. One way to slice networks is according to “flow space”, whereby different controllers might control distinct and non-overlapping traffic flows.
c. A controller can prevent one network slice from interfering with the resources of another.
d. Multi-tenant datacenters are one use case for network slicing.
e. Conventional (i.e., non-SDN) networks have no concept of network virtualization or slicing.
","a,b,d","a,b,c,d","Network slicing allows creating multiple virtual networks on top of a shared physical infrastructure. This enables (a) testing configurations on shadow networks mirroring production, (b) slicing by flow space where controllers handle distinct traffic flows, (c) resource isolation between slices, and (d) multi-tenancy in data centers. However, (e) is incorrect as conventional networks do have concepts like VLANs for basic virtualization, though SDN enables more advanced slicing.","['https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/nfv/definitions/what-is-network-slicing/', 'https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-definition/', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/network-slicing.html']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.95,1,Conceptual error. c) controller cannot establish resource isolation between slices,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,1,Article,0.0,1,1,1,Advanced networking,3,3,3,3,0.6000000000000001
63,Which of the following are true about flow spaces? Select all that apply.,"a. Two flow spaces cannot overlap.
b. One host could send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces.
c. Flow spaces can only be defined according to combinations of packet header fields.
d. Flowspace isolation separates individual virtual networks from one another but incurs some performance penalty for doing so.
e. Two controllers that write data-plane rules for non-overlapping parts of flowspace can never cause traffic from one “slice” to enter the other slice.
",b,"b,d","Two statements are true about flow spaces:b) One host could indeed send traffic that ends up in two different flow spaces. Flow spaces can overlap, so a single host's traffic could match rules in multiple flow spaces.  d) Flowspace isolation does separate individual virtual networks but at the cost of some performance overhead to enforce the isolation between slices.The other statements are incorrect:a) Flow spaces can overlap, so this is false.c) Flow spaces can be defined by other attributes beyond just packet headers, such as physical ports. e) Even with non-overlapping flow spaces, misconfiguration or bugs could cause leakage of traffic between slices if the isolation is not robustly enforced.","['https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/openflow-spec-v1.1.0.pdf', 'https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos597E/papers/sdnintro.pdf']",0,8_data_center_virtualization,0.9,1,Conceptual error. d) they do not incur any additional penalty,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,0,,,1,1,1,Advanced networking,3,3,3,3,0.6000000000000001
