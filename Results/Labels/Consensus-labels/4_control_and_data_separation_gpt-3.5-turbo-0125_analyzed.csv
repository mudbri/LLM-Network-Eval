28,How does the separation of the control and data plane make networking in data centers easier?,"a. Virtual machines can be migrated within the network without renumbering entire portions of the network or re-assigning network services to different IP addresses.
b. The control plane allows traffic to be forwarded using Layer 2 addresses, thus allowing automatic load balance across the topology.
c. The separation allows fewer switches to be used in the data center topology, thus lowering costs.
d. All routes can be controlled and monitored from a central point of control.
e. A network controller can permit the renumbering of end hosts to have topology-dependent Layer 2 MAC addresses.","a,d,e","a,d","The separation of the control and data plane in Software Defined Networking (SDN) makes networking in data centers easier for the following reasons:

a. Virtual machines can be migrated within the network without renumbering entire portions of the network or re-assigning network services to different IP addresses: This is a key advantage of SDN where the control plane can dynamically update forwarding rules to accommodate VM migrations without the need for manual reconfiguration of network elements.

b. The control plane allows traffic to be forwarded using Layer 2 addresses, thus allowing automatic load balance across the topology: This statement is not entirely accurate as load balancing is typically a function of the data plane and the SDN controller's decisions based on network conditions.

c. The separation allows fewer switches to be used in the data center topology, thus lowering costs: While SDN can optimize network resource utilization, the primary benefit is not necessarily reducing the number of switches but rather improving network flexibility and management.

d. All routes can be controlled and monitored from a central point of control: This is a significant advantage of SDN where a centralized controller can manage and monitor the network, leading to better visibility, control, and troubleshooting capabilities.

e. A network controller can permit the renumbering of end hosts to have topology-dependent Layer 2 MAC addresses: This statement is not directly related to the benefits of separating the control and data plane in SDN.",[],0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.9,0.999954197228479,Just wrong information,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,,,,1,1,0,Advanced networking,3,3,3,3,0.6000000000000001

b. Inability to respond to link failures.
c. Incorrect security policies.
d. Incorrect operation when one controller fails.
e. Forwarding loops.
","c,e","a,b,d","Having multiple controller replicas in a network can lead to various issues due to consistency problems in the control plane. 
- Option a (A flood of traffic at the controller) is correct because inconsistencies among multiple controllers can cause a surge of messages or requests to a specific controller, overwhelming it with unnecessary traffic. 
- Option b (Inability to respond to link failures) is correct as inconsistencies may result in controllers not being aware of network changes like link failures, leading to an inability to reroute traffic effectively. 
- Option d (Incorrect operation when one controller fails) is also accurate because if one controller fails and the others have inconsistent information, the network may operate incorrectly or inefficiently.",[],0,4_control_and_data_separation,0.9,0.746798361010719,A lot of conceptual and reasoning errors,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,Incorrect reasoning/deduction,Faulty inference,0,,,,1,1,1,Advanced networking,3,3,2,3,0.0
