b. show startup-config
c. show ip access-lists
d. show access-lists
","c,d","a,c","To display the configuration of an IPv4 Access Control List (ACL) including the line numbers, the 'show running-config' command can be used. This command shows the current configuration of the router, including all the ACLs with their line numbers. The 'show ip access-lists' command specifically displays all IPv4 ACLs on the router, including their line numbers. The 'show startup-config' command displays the saved configuration that the router will use upon the next reload, which does not necessarily show the line numbers of ACLs. The 'show access-lists' command does not include the 'ip' keyword and might not provide the detailed IPv4-specific ACL information including line numbers.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/ios-firewall/23602-confaccesslists.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/m/en_us/techdoc/dc/reference/cli/nxos/commands/fund/show-access-lists.html']",0,chapter9_ip_acl,0.95,0.98282040664365,Just wrong facts,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,1.0,documentation,1.0,1,1,0,Network administration,3,4,2,4,0.0

b. Second statement
c. Third statement
d. Forth statement
e. Implied deny at the end of the ACL
",a,c,"Access Control Lists (ACLs) process packets sequentially based on the order of the statements within the ACL until a match is found. Once a match is found, the ACL does not check further statements. The packet with source IP address 20.20.20.20 would be matched by the third statement because it is the first statement that exactly matches the address and has the most specific wildcard mask (0.0.0.255), which means any address 20.20.20.0 through 20.20.20.255 would match. The first and second statements have less specific wildcard masks and are therefore not considered exact matches.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/ios-firewall/23602-confaccesslists.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/26448-ACLsamples.html']",0,chapter9_ip_acl,1.0,0.988664333368996,Had the correct concept and the incorrect concept at the same time,Incorrect reasoning/deduction,An error related to misinterpreting IP addresses,Wrong Facts/Concept,"Having the wrong information/concept, Internal inconsistency",0,2.0,"documentation, documentation",2.0,0,1,1,Network security,2,2,1,1,0.1999999999999999
