69,Your senior network engineer tells you to configure the DHCP server to lease the last 100 usable IP addresses in subnet 12.5.4.0/23. Which of the following IP addresses could be leased as a result of your new configuration?,"a. 12.5.1.156

d. 12.5.255.200",b,c,"The subnet 12.5.4.0/23 encompasses the IP address range from 12.5.4.0 to 12.5.5.255. To lease the last 100 usable IP addresses, we need to look at the end of this range. The last IP address in the range, 12.5.5.255, is reserved for the broadcast address, and the second to last, 12.5.5.254, would be the highest usable IP address. Counting back from there, the last 100 usable IP addresses would fall between 12.5.5.155 and 12.5.5.254.

The correct calculation for the third octet should be 128 + 64 = 192, but since we need 18 bits, we need to add 32 to the 192, resulting in 224.

86,"Which of the following masks, when used within a Class B network, would supply enough subnet bits to support 90 subnets? (Choose two)","a. /24
b. /21
c. /19
d. 255.255.255.252
e. 255.255.240.0
f. 255.255.224.0","a,d","b,e","In a Class B network, the default subnet mask is 255.255.0.0, which corresponds to a /16 prefix length. To support 90 subnets, we need to determine how many bits are required to represent at least 90 unique values. Using the formula 2^n >= number of subnets (where n is the number of bits), we find that 2^7 = 128, which is the smallest power of 2 greater than 90. Therefore, we need 7 additional bits for subnetting. Adding these 7 bits to the original 16 bits of the Class B network, we get a subnet mask of /23 (16+7=23). However, since the question asks for a mask that can support at least 90 subnets, we can use a /21 or a /22 subnet mask, which provides even more subnets. The corresponding decimal subnet masks for /21 and /22 are 255.255.248.0 and 255.255.240.0, respectively. Option b (/21) and option e (255.255.240.0) are therefore correct. Option d (255.255.255.252) is a /30 mask which is typically used for point-to-point links, and option f (255.255.224.0) is a /19 mask which provides more subnets than required.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html', 'https://www.ripe.net/about-us/press-centre/understanding-ip-addressing']",0,chapter4_advanced_ipv4_addressing,0.95,0.583704562667878,Reached the correct answer but got confused midway?,Incorrect reasoning/deduction,Contradictory reasoning,,,1,2,"trusted article, documentation",2,0,1,0,Basic networking,3,3,1,1,0
