33,Which of the following are true about the RCP? Select all that apply.,"a. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, the RCP controller for an AS sees all routes for all destinations that an AS learns from neighboring ASes.
b. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, there is no need for ASes to use BGP to exchange routes.
c. In an RCP deployment, routers no longer have to compute routes.
d. The RCP controller operates just like a route reflector would, selecting a single best route for each destination for all client routers.
e. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, a single AS can benefit from deploying RCP even if no other ASes deploy RCP.","c,e","a,d","a. In Phase 1 of RCP deployment, the RCP controller for an AS sees all routes for all destinations that an AS learns from neighboring ASes: This is true as in the first phase of RCP deployment, the RCP controller in an AS collects all the routes from the neighboring ASes.
d. The RCP controller operates just like a route reflector would, selecting a single best route for each destination for all client routers: This statement is accurate as the RCP controller, similar to a route reflector, chooses the best route for each destination and propagates it to the client routers.",['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140366416303958'],0,5_routing_control_platform_and_4d,0.9,0.57502195287531,"1.  The RCP controller does not operate exactly like a route reflector. While a route reflector selects a single best route for each destination for its clients, the RCP can potentially make more individualized routing decisions for each router based on a wider array of information.

34,"Which of the following are true about network management with BGP, in the absence of RCP? Select all that apply.","a. BGP's interaction with the underlying routing IGP routing protocol can result in persistent forwarding loops.
b. Implementing network-wide policy sometimes causes the routers themeselves to have to carry state.
c. Each router operates and makes decisions based only on a local view of network state.

38,What are some examples of how a separate decision plane in the 4D architecture can amortize system overhead? Select all that apply.,"a. Maintaining a single table in memory of AS paths that are learned across all BGP sessions in the AS, and using references into that table for specific routers (and routing decisions), to save memory.
b. If secure BGP were deployed, verifying the signatures on the AS paths of routes received from neighbors.
c. Keeping track of topology information.
d. Performing route computation on behalf of all the routers in the AS.
e. Performing inbound traffic engineering on a set of links in a coordinated fashion.
