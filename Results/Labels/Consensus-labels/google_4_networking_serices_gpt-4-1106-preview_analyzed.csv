46,What transport layer protocol does DNS normally use?,"a. TCP
b. IP
c. UDP
d. ICMP
",c,"a,c","The Domain Name System (DNS) primarily uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) for its transactions. UDP is used because it is a connectionless protocol, which allows for faster transmission of small queries and responses without the overhead of establishing a connection that TCP requires. However, DNS can also use the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) when the data size exceeds 512 bytes or for tasks such as zone transfers where reliability is more important than speed. IP is a network layer protocol and is used by both TCP and UDP to transport data across networks, but it is not specific to DNS. ICMP, which stands for Internet Control Message Protocol, is used for diagnostic purposes and error messages in the network layer and is not used by DNS for its queries.","['https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/']",0,4_networking_serices,0.95,0.695234416749414,"Misinterpreting question, the question is about what is normally used not what can be used",Misinterpreting questions,Misinterpreting a word,,,1,2,"trusted article, RFC",2,1,1,0,Basic networking,1,3,2,2,0.5
69,What are some use cases for reverse proxies? Select all that apply.,"a. Improved computer graphics
b. Load balancing
c. IP address translation
d. Encryption and Decryption
","b,d","b,c,d","Reverse proxies are servers that sit in front of web servers and forward client (e.g., web browser) requests to those web servers. They have several use cases, including but not limited to: Load balancing (b), where the reverse proxy distributes incoming requests evenly across multiple servers to prevent any one server from becoming overloaded. IP address translation (c), where the reverse proxy can hide the IP addresses of the servers behind it, effectively anonymizing the backend servers' addresses from the outside world. Encryption and Decryption (d), where the reverse proxy can handle the encryption and decryption of data, providing SSL offloading for the web servers behind it. This relieves backend servers from the computational load of encrypting and decrypting traffic. Improved computer graphics (a) is not a use case for reverse proxies as it is unrelated to the functions of network traffic management or server-side operations.","['https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/', 'https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/reverse-proxy-server/']",0,4_networking_serices,1.0,0.994342716522599,"Even though reverse proxies can perform IP translation, that is not their main use case, which the question is asking for",Misinterpreting questions,Misinterpreting a word,,,1,2,"trusted article, trusted article",2,1,1,0,Network security,3,2,2,2,0.5
