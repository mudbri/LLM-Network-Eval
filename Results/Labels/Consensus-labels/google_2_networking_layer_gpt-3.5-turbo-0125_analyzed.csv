30,How many possible host IDs do you always lose per network?,"a. 8
b. 12
c. 4
d. 2",d,a,"In IP networking, each subnet has two reserved addresses: one for the network address and one for the broadcast address. Therefore, for each subnet, you lose two host IDs. Since 2^3 = 8, you always lose 8 possible host IDs per network.",[],0,2_networking_layer,0.9,0.677050347701354,Had the correct answer but randomly introduced 2^3 which makes no sense at all here.

",a,c,"Non-routable address space, such as the addresses defined in RFC 1918 (e.g., 10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16), is reserved for private networks and should not be routed on the public internet. These addresses are commonly used within internal networks for private communications and should not be advertised on the global internet. Using non-routable address space for testing purposes helps prevent conflicts with public IP addresses and ensures the security of internal networks.",['https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918'],0,2_networking_layer,0.9,0.999618497130734,Misinterpreting the question.
