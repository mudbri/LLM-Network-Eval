16,Which of the following command is used to generate an OpenFlow network topology consisting of a single switch and 8 hosts with randomly generated MAC addresses for each host?,"a. sudo mn --topo single,8  --switch ovsk --controller remote
b. sudo mn --topo single,3 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
c. sudo mn --topo single,8 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
d. sudo mn --topo linear,8  --switch ovsk --controller remote",a,c,"The Mininet command 'sudo mn' is used to create a network topology in a Software Defined Networking (SDN) environment. The '--topo' flag specifies the topology type and the number of nodes. The 'single,8' argument indicates a single switch connected to 8 hosts. The '--mac' flag is used to automatically assign MAC addresses to the hosts. The '--switch ovsk' specifies the use of the Open vSwitch kernel switch, and '--controller remote' indicates that the switch should connect to a remote controller. Therefore, the command that generates an OpenFlow network topology with a single switch and 8 hosts, each with a randomly generated MAC address, is 'sudo mn --topo single,8 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote'.","['http://mininet.org/', 'http://mininet.org/walkthrough/']",0,3_mininet_setup,1,0.999999687183719,"Doesn’t know that —Mac is used for sequential generation of Mac addresses, not random",Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,2,"documentation, documentation",2,1,1,0,Network administration,3,4,3,4,0
