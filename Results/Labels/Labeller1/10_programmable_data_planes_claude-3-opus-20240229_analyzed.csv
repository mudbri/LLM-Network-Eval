113,"Which are reasonable approaches for designing a fast, scalable, programmable data plane? Select all that apply.","a. Make hardware routers more programmable with custom OpenFlow chips.
b. Make software routers faster by reducing the need to copy packets from the kernel into user space.
c. Send all traffic through software switches running in user space.
d. Make software routers faster by distributing software routers across clusters.
e. Make software routers faster by amortizing packet-processing costs across batches of packets.
","a,b,d,e","b,d,e",Making software routers faster can be achieved through multiple approaches:b) Reducing the need to copy packets from kernel to user space avoids costly context switches and memory copies.  d) Distributing software routers across clusters allows load balancing and parallel processing of packets.e) Processing batches of packets amortizes the fixed costs of scheduling and invoking the packet-processing code.Making hardware routers more programmable with custom chips (a) or sending all traffic through user-space software (c) are less scalable approaches.,"['A.

118,What are some tricks commonly employed in software to accelerate packet forwarding? Select all that apply.,"a. Ethernet GRE tunnels
b. Large packet buffers that hold multiple packets that can be read with a single read
c. Forwarding smaller packets before larger packets
d. Avoiding lookups on the software bridge between virtual interfaces and physical interfaces
e. Batch processing
","a,b,d,e","b,e","Two common tricks used in software to accelerate packet forwarding are:b) Using large packet buffers that can hold multiple packets. This allows multiple packets to be read with a single read operation, reducing the overhead of multiple reads.  e) Batch processing packets. By processing a batch of packets together, various optimizations can be made to improve throughput compared to processing each packet individually.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross, Section 4.4 on Switching', 'High-Performance Packet Processing on Commodity Hardware, Gallenm√ºller et al., IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 2020']",0,10_programmable_data_planes,0.9,1,Does not know that b and d are also true,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,2,"research paper, book",2,1,0,0,Advanced networking,3,3,3,3,,0.2
120,"Which of the following are motivations for SwitchBlade, which supports composition of pre-synthesized hardware data plane modules on an FPGA? Select all that apply.","a. Most data plane protocols involve composing only a limited number of data-plane actions.
b. Experimental data planes may need to operate in parallel with production data planes.
c. Programming in Verilog is difficult.
d. FPGAs are lower-cost and consume less power than conventional ASICs or OpenFlow switching chips.
e. Programming in C is difficult.
","a,b,c","a,b","SwitchBlade is motivated by the observations that (a) most data plane protocols involve composing only a limited number of data-plane actions, and (b) experimental data planes may need to operate in parallel with production data planes on the same switch. By pre-synthesizing common data plane modules on an FPGA and allowing them to be composed, SwitchBlade aims to simplify the development of custom data planes while enabling parallel operation with production forwarding.","['SwitchBlade: A Platform for Rapid Deployment of Network Protocols on Programmable Hardware, Anwer et al., SIGCOMM 2010', 'https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/papers/switchblade10.pdf']",0,10_programmable_data_planes,0.9,1,The fact that programming in verilog is also difficult direct motivation.
