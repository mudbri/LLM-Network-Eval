56,Which of the following need to be configured for a computer to operate on a modern network? Check all that apply.,"a. A MAC address
b. An IP address
c. A TCP port
d. A name server
","b,d","a,b,d","To operate on a modern network, a computer needs to have a MAC address, an IP address, and be configured to use a name server. 

- MAC address (a): This is essential for communication at the data link layer of the OSI model, providing a unique identifier for network interfaces.
- IP address (b): It is necessary for network communication at the network layer of the OSI model, enabling devices to communicate with each other over an IP-based network.
- Name server (d): Computers need to be configured to use name servers to resolve domain names to IP addresses, enabling access to resources on the internet.",[],0,4_networking_serices,0.9,0.999993295002779,"The question is not asking what a computer needs to have, but what needs to be configured",Misinterpreting questions,Incorrect copying of the question,,Incorrect copying of the question,0,,,,1,1,0,Basic networking,2,2,2,2,0.5
66,What is two-factor authentication? Select all that apply.,"a. a method where you need two passwords
b. a method where you authenticate twice
c. a method that requires two usernames
d. a method where users are required to verify their credentials through a combination of hardware and/or software. Usually a username, password, and a short-lived token.
","b,d",d,"Two-factor authentication is a method where users are required to verify their credentials through a combination of something they know (like a password) and something they have (like a smartphone or hardware token).

69,What are some use cases for reverse proxies? Select all that apply.,"a. Improved computer graphics
b. Load balancing
c. IP address translation
d. Encryption and Decryption
","b,d","b,c","Reverse proxies are commonly used for load balancing and IP address translation. 
 a. Improved computer graphics is unrelated to the use cases of reverse proxies. 
 b. Load balancing is a common use case where a reverse proxy distributes client requests across multiple servers to ensure efficient resource utilization and high availability. 
 c. IP address translation is another important use case where a reverse proxy can hide the actual server's IP address from clients for security or anonymity reasons. 
 d. Encryption and decryption are typically handled by other components like SSL/TLS termination proxies, not reverse proxies.",[],0,4_networking_serices,0.9,0.999999210369312,"Misinformation, since proxies do help with encryption/decryption and do not help with ip translation",Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,,,,1,0,1,Network security,3,3,2,2,0
