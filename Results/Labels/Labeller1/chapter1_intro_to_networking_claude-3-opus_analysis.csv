b. Switch and PC
c. Hub and switch
d. Router and hub
","b,d","a,b","A straight-through Ethernet cable is used when connecting devices of different types, such as a router to a PC or a switch to a PC. The wiring is straight through, meaning each pin on one end is connected to the same pin on the other end. Choices 'a' (router and PC) and 'b' (switch and PC) require a straight-through cable because they involve connecting dissimilar devices. Choices 'c' (hub and switch) and 'd' (router and hub) connect similar devices, which typically use a crossover cable instead.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Wendell Odom, Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-6500-series-switches/21223-cable-connection-21223.html']",0,chapter1_intro_to_networking,0.95,1,Correct concept but wrong facts (e.g. router and PC being dissimilar),Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,1,book,1,1,1,0,Network administration,3,6,2,1,0
