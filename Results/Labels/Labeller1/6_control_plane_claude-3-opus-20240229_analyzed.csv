49,Which of the following are true about hubs and learning switches? Select all that apply,"a. A hub implemented in Pox requires all incoming packets to be directed to the controller.
b. A learning switch requires more logic at the controller (in terms of lines of code in Pox) than a hub.
c. A learning switch implemented in Pox can be easily extended to support firewall capabilities.
d. A learning switch implemented in Pox requires all incoming packets to be redirected to the controller.
e. A hub forwards an incoming packet on all ports (except the incoming port), whereas a switch only floods an incoming packet on all ports if it does not have a table entry that determines the output port for that packet.
","b,c,e","c,e","A learning switch can be extended to support firewall capabilities by adding logic to the controller to filter or block certain packets based on predefined rules. A hub floods incoming packets on all ports except the incoming port, while a learning switch only floods if it doesn't have a matching entry in its MAC address table to determine the output port.","['https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-is-sdn-controller/', 'https://noxrepo.github.io/pox-doc/html/#forwarding-hubs-and-switches', 'https://opennetworking.org/sdn-definition/']",0,6_control_plane,0.9,1,Doesnâ€™t know that learning switch would require more code - conceptual issue,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,3,"trusted article, trusted article, documentation",3,1,0,0,Advanced networking,3,4,2,2,0.6000000000000001
50,Which of the following functions ensures that the controller will hear PacketIn messages? Select all that apply.,"a. connection.addListeners
b. _handle_PacketIn
c. AddRule
d. init
e. launch
",a,"a,b","The connection.addListeners function is used to register listeners for various OpenFlow messages, including PacketIn messages. This ensures the controller will receive PacketIn events. The _handle_PacketIn function is the actual handler that processes the received PacketIn messages. The other options - AddRule, init, and launch - are not directly related to enabling the controller to receive PacketIn messages.","['https://github.com/mininet/openflow-tutorial/wiki/Create-a-Learning-Switch', 'https://noxrepo.github.io/pox-doc/html/#the-packetin-event']",0,6_control_plane,0.95,1,Classic case of misinterpreting questions.
