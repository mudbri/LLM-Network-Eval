203,Which of the following characteristics of network traffic can be managed by Quality of Service (QoS)? (Choose all that apply),"a. Bandwidth
b. LLQ
c. Loss
d. Delay
e. CoS
f. Jitter
","a,c,d,f","a,b,c,d,e,f","Quality of Service (QoS) can manage various characteristics of network traffic, including: 
a. Bandwidth: QoS can prioritize and allocate bandwidth to different types of traffic based on defined policies. 
b. LLQ (Low Latency Queuing): It is a QoS mechanism that provides strict priority queuing for delay-sensitive data such as voice and video. 
c. Loss: QoS can help mitigate packet loss by prioritizing critical traffic and ensuring its delivery. 
d. Delay: QoS can minimize delays for specific types of traffic by managing queuing and scheduling mechanisms. 
e. CoS (Class of Service): QoS can classify and treat different types of traffic based on their class of service, allowing for differentiated handling. 
f. Jitter: QoS can help reduce jitter by prioritizing real-time traffic to ensure a more consistent delivery rate.",['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3850/software/release/3se/qos/configuration_guide/b_qos_3se_3850_cg/b_qos_3se_3850_cg_chapter_01000.html'],0,chapter11_ip_services,0.9,0.773836900215352,Some of these are mechanisms and not characteristics of QoS itself.
