39,Which of the following Cisco IOS Software Command Help lists commands that start with int?,"a. int<Tab>
b. int ?
c. ?
d. int?
",d,b,"In Cisco IOS, to list commands that start with a specific sequence of characters, you use that sequence followed by a space and then a question mark. In this case, 'int ?' will list all the commands that start with 'int' when you are in the appropriate mode that recognizes interface-level commands. The '<Tab>' key is typically used for command completion rather than listing commands, and '?' on its own lists all commands available in the current mode. 'int?' without a space would not be recognized as a request for help within the IOS command-line interface.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/fundamentals/command/reference/cf_book/cf_n1.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/smb/routers/cisco-rv-series-small-business-routers/smb5534-using-question-mark-for-command-help-in-cisco-ios.html']",0,chapter2_ethernet_lans,0.95,0.973485940006414,Having wrong information,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,0,,,1,1,1,Network administration,3,4,2,4,0
