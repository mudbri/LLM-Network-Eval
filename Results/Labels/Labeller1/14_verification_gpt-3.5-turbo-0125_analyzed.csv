106,Which of the following are true about configuration verification? Select all that apply.,"a. Configuration verification can only detect errors after the configuration is installed on production routers.
b. Configuration verification cannot detect incorrect protocol behavior that may result from faulty hardware.
c. Verifying the correctness of network behavior based on configuration requires a model of protocol behavior.
d. Configuration verification requires a large-scale simulation of network protocols, complete with tests for different message orderings and timings.
e. Configuration verification cannot detect incorrect protocol behavior that may result from buggy software.
","b,c,e",c,"Option c is correct because verifying the correctness of network behavior based on configuration indeed requires a model of protocol behavior. This is essential to ensure that the configuration aligns with the expected behavior of the network protocols in use. Options a, b, d, and e are incorrect. Option a is incorrect because configuration verification tools can be used before deploying configurations to production routers to catch errors early. Option b is incorrect because configuration verification can indeed detect incorrect protocol behavior resulting from faulty hardware. Option d is incorrect because while simulation can be part of the verification process, it is not always necessary to have large-scale simulations for basic verification. Option e is incorrect because configuration verification can indeed help detect incorrect protocol behavior resulting from buggy software.",[],0,14_verification,0.9,0.999911718773017,Config verification cannot verify faulty hardware and faulty software,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,,,,1,1,1,Advanced networking,3,4,1,1,,0.1999999999999999

b. The current settings of link weights will result in all routers being connected.
c. The configuration of route reflectors and clients ensures that any route learned from a neighboring AS will propagate to all routers in the topology.

108,Which of the following are true about data-plane verification? Select all that apply.,"a. Data-plane verification techniques such as header-space analysis typically operate on a single ""snapshot"" of data-plane state.
b. Data plane verification can only operate on the forwarding table of a single router or switch; network-wide analysis is not possible.
c. Data-plane verification may detect errors that configuration analysis can miss in the cases of buggy control-plane software.
d. Data-plane verification requires accurate modeling of network protocols, including which bits are present in which part of the packet header.
e. Header-space analysis can only provide verification/analysis for specific packets; it cannot answer questions for general parts of flowspace.

b. Two virtual network ""slices"" are not completely isolated: it is possible for traffic to travel from one slice to the other.
c. The configuration of the network's routing protocols will result in persistent oscillation (i.e., they will never settle on a stable set of routes).
