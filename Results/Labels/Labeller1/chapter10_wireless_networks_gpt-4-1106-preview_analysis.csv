187,The maximum configurable number of WLANs on a controller is __________________.,"a. 5
b. 152
c. 251
d. 512",d,c,"The maximum configurable number of WLANs on a Cisco Wireless LAN Controller depends on the specific model of the controller. However, for many Cisco controllers, the maximum number is 512. This number can vary based on the software version and the specific model of the controller. Since 512 is a common upper limit for high-end models, and 251 is not a standard upper limit, the correct answer is likely an error in the question. Assuming the question meant to refer to a specific model that supports up to 251 WLANs, the correct answer would be 'c'. However, without specific model information, the general answer for high-end Cisco controllers would be 512.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/technotes/8-5/b_cisco_wlc_features_by_software_release_8_5.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless-mobility/wlan-security/116057-technote-wlc-00.html']",0,chapter10_wireless_networks,0.7,0.512109315446757,Wrong information that the number depends on the version of the controller - it seems like it is a known limit,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,Incorrect reasoning/deduction,Faulty inference,2,0,,,1,1,0,Network administration,1,4,1,4,0
191,"You are creating a new WLAN with the controller GUI, which of the following parameters are necessary? (Choose two)","a. VLAN number
b. SSID
c. Interface
d. BSSID
e. IP subnet
","b,c","a,b","When creating a new Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) using a controller's graphical user interface (GUI), the two necessary parameters are the VLAN number and the Service Set Identifier (SSID). The VLAN number is used to associate the WLAN with a specific VLAN, segregating traffic for security and organizational purposes. The SSID is the network name that clients will see and use to connect to the WLAN. The interface is often associated with a VLAN, but it is not a parameter you 'create' as part of the WLAN; it is something you associate the WLAN with. The Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID) is a parameter that is automatically generated (it is the MAC address of the wireless access point), so it is not something you manually configure. The IP subnet is related to the network design but is not a WLAN parameter in the controller GUI.","['https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless-mobility/wireless-lan-wlan/82180-wlc-config.html', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/technotes/8-0/WLAN_Configuration/b_WLAN_Configuration_8.html', 'https://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=1271791']",0,chapter10_wireless_networks,0.95,0.498309178120132,"VLAN is not necessary, since it is already associated with the interface.

The 802.11a standard operates in the 5 GHz band, not the 2.4 GHz band. The 802.11ac and 802.11ax standards also primarily use the 5 GHz band, although 802.11ax (also known as Wi-Fi 6) is designed to operate in both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. However, since the question specifically asks for the standards that use the 2.4 GHz band, the most accurate answers are 802.11, 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n, which are all known to operate in the 2.4 GHz band.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels']",0,chapter10_wireless_networks,0.95,0.999998152718056,"Question didnâ€™t ask if it only uses 2.4, just which ones use 2.4",Misinterpreting questions,Quantifier issue,,,2,2,"wikipedia, wikipedia",2,1,1,0,Network administration,1,1,1,1,0.7142857142857142
