211,Your company plans to start using public cloud service and now you are considering different WAN options. Your main concern is security by keeping the data private while also providing good QoS services. Which of the following options are under consideration? (Choose two answers.),"a. Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider
b. Using an Internet connection without VPN
c. Using an Internet connection with VPN
d. Using an intercloud exchange
","a,d","a,c","When connecting to public cloud services, the two best options for maintaining data privacy and providing good QoS are: a) Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider, and c) Using an Internet connection with VPN. Private WAN connections, like dedicated leased lines or MPLS, provide secure, isolated connectivity to the cloud provider's network. A VPN over the public Internet encrypts the data, keeping it private, while also allowing QoS policies to prioritize critical traffic. The other choices, using the Internet without VPN or an intercloud exchange, do not inherently provide the required level of security and QoS control for this scenario.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Wendell Odom, Cisco Press, 2020', 'Cisco SD-WAN: Cloud Scale Architecture, Kiran Ghodgaonkar, Cisco Press, 2022', 'Cisco Networking Academy: Introduction to Networks v7.0, Cisco Press, 2020']",0,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,1,Does not identify that VLAN would not be good for QoS.

213,"A company uses a Metro Ethernet WAN with an Ethernet LAN (E-LAN) service, with the company headquarters plus 20 remote sites connected to the service. The enterprise uses OSPF at all sites, with one router connected to the service from each site. Which of the following are true about the Layer 3 details most likely used with this service and design? (Choose all that apply)","a. The WAN uses one IP subnet
b. The WAN uses 20 or more IP subnets
c. A remote site router would have one OSPF neighbor
d. A remote site router would have 20 OSPF neighbors","a,d","a,c","In a Metro Ethernet WAN with E-LAN service, all sites are connected to a single Layer 2 domain, effectively forming a single IP subnet (choice a). Each remote site router would have a single OSPF neighbor relationship with the headquarters router over this shared Layer 2 network (choice c). The network does not require multiple IP subnets for connectivity between sites (eliminates choice b), and a remote site router would not form OSPF neighbor relationships with the other remote site routers, only with the headquarters router (eliminates choice d).","['Cisco Press CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Part 2, Chapter 16: WAN Concepts', 'Cisco Documentation: Layer 2 WAN Architecture Overview (https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Enterprise/WAN_and_MAN/L2WAN_Arch_Oview.html)']",0,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,1,"Misinterprets the context, not all routers are connected to the headquarters",Misinterpreting questions,Misinterpreting a word,,,0,0,,,0,1,0,Network administration,2,3,2,2,0
