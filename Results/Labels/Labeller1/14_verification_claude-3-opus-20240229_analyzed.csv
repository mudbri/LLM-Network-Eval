106,Which of the following are true about configuration verification? Select all that apply.,"a. Configuration verification can only detect errors after the configuration is installed on production routers.
b. Configuration verification cannot detect incorrect protocol behavior that may result from faulty hardware.
c. Verifying the correctness of network behavior based on configuration requires a model of protocol behavior.
d. Configuration verification requires a large-scale simulation of network protocols, complete with tests for different message orderings and timings.
e. Configuration verification cannot detect incorrect protocol behavior that may result from buggy software.
","b,c,e",c,"Configuration verification requires a model of the expected protocol behavior in order to check if the configuration will produce the desired network behavior. It does not necessarily require large-scale simulations with tests for message orderings and timings (d). Configuration verification can be done before installing configurations on production routers (a). While it may not catch all issues caused by faulty hardware (b) or buggy software (e), configuration verification is still a useful step to validate intended behavior based on the configuration itself.","['https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/papers/veriflow13.pdf', 'https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi13/nsdi13-final68.pdf']",0,14_verification,0.9,1,Config verification cannot verify faulty hardware and faulty software,Incorrect reasoning/deduction,Self-aware but still wrong conclusion,,,1,1,research paper,0,1,1,0,Advanced networking,1,4,1,1,0.1999999999999999
107,"Which of the following assertions could be verified with configuration verification (i.e., of a snapshot of router and switch configuration)? Select all that apply.","a. A route learned from one peer will not be readvertised to another peer.
b. The current settings of link weights will result in all routers being connected.
c. The configuration of route reflectors and clients ensures that any route learned from a neighboring AS will propagate to all routers in the topology.
d. There is no traffic pattern that would ever result in a stateful firewall dropping traffic.
e. Any time that an infection occurs, hosts are automatically quarantined.
","a,b,c","a,c","Configuration verification can check properties that depend only on the configuration, not on dynamic network state. Option (a) can be verified by checking that route filters are correctly configured to prevent readvertisement between peers. Option (c) can be verified by analyzing the route reflector configuration to ensure routes propagate fully. Options (b), (d) and (e) depend on dynamic state like link weights, traffic patterns, and infection events, so they cannot be verified solely from configuration.","['https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/papers/sigcomm13.pdf', 'https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/abhashkumar']",0,14_verification,0.9,1,Does not know that the current settings are affecting link connectivity is not a dynamic property,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,1,research paper,1,1,1,1,Advanced networking,3,4,2,2,0.6000000000000001
108,Which of the following are true about data-plane verification? Select all that apply.,"a. Data-plane verification techniques such as header-space analysis typically operate on a single ""snapshot"" of data-plane state.
b. Data plane verification can only operate on the forwarding table of a single router or switch; network-wide analysis is not possible.
c. Data-plane verification may detect errors that configuration analysis can miss in the cases of buggy control-plane software.
d. Data-plane verification requires accurate modeling of network protocols, including which bits are present in which part of the packet header.
e. Header-space analysis can only provide verification/analysis for specific packets; it cannot answer questions for general parts of flowspace.
","a,c","a,c,d","Data-plane verification techniques like header-space analysis typically operate on a snapshot of the data-plane state across the network (a). It can detect errors missed by configuration analysis if there are bugs in the control-plane software that cause the data plane to behave differently than intended (c). Data-plane verification requires accurately modeling the network protocols and header fields to reason about packet processing (d). However, data-plane verification is not limited to a single device and can perform network-wide analysis (b is incorrect).
