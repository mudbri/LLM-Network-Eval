56,Which of the following are true of the Mininet network emulator? Select all that apply.,"a. It requires running OpenFlow-capable switches.
b. It is difficult to use it to route traffic for real services.
c. Mininet only allows users to create three types of topologies: linear, tree, and single-switch topologies.
d. It can create an emulation that runs across multiple physically distributed nodes.
e. All of the hosts in the topology must run the same underlying operating system.
","b,e","b,d","Mininet does not require running OpenFlow-capable switches, as it can emulate OpenFlow switches in software (a is incorrect). Mininet can be used to route traffic for real services, but it is not well-suited for this purpose due to performance limitations of the emulation environment (b is correct). Mininet allows users to create arbitrary network topologies, not just linear, tree, and single-switch (c is incorrect). Mininet can distribute the emulation across multiple physical machines to improve scalability (d is correct). The emulated hosts in Mininet share the same kernel, but can run different software (e is incorrect).","['https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Introduction-to-Mininet', 'https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-is-mininet/']",0,7_virtual_networking,0.95,1,"Not knowing that d is incorrect.

58,Which of the following are possible in Mininet? Select all that apply.,"a. Measuring the latency between a host in San Francisco and a host in Los Angeles.
b. Assigning custom IP addresses to each node in the topology.
c. Assigning IP addresses to each node in the topology using a DHCP server.
d. Running performance measurement tools (e.g., iperf, wget) between nodes.
e. ""Shaping"" a link between two nodes to a particular traffic rate.
","b,c,d,e","b,d,e","In Mininet, it is possible to assign custom IP addresses to each node in the topology (b), run performance measurement tools like iperf and wget between nodes (d), and shape the traffic rate on a link between two nodes (e). However, Mininet runs as a single process on a single machine, so it cannot measure latency between geographically distant hosts (a). Also, while IP addresses can be assigned, Mininet does not include a DHCP server functionality to automatically assign them (c).","['Mininet Walkthrough - https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Walkthrough', 'Introduction to Mininet - https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Introduction-to-Mininet', 'Mininet Python API Reference Manual - http://mininet.org/api/annotated.html']",0,7_virtual_networking,0.95,1,Missing info - mining does offer a DHCP server,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,2,"documentation, documentation",2,1,1,1,Network administration,3,4,3,4,0.6000000000000001
60,Which of the following are stated applications of the Nicira Network Virtualization Platform? Select all that apply.,"a. Easier transition to IPv6 in data-center networks.
b. Creating more than 1024 virtual networks, as opposed to the alternative of using VLAN tags.

61,Select the statement that is most true about the relationship between network virtualization and SDNs.,"a. Network virtualization is a potential enabler for software-defined networks, since the separation of data and control planes first requires the creation of a logical network.
b. Software-defined networking is a potential enabler for virtual networks, since separation of data and control planes makes it easier to manage a logical network topology.
c. Network virtualization is a new concept introduced by Amazon, Nicira, and industry players; it only made sense to talk about network virtualization once central SDN controllers existed.
d. Network virtualization and software-defined networking each enable the other: SDN cannot exist without network virtualization, and network virtualization cannot exist without SDN.
",b,"a,b","Both statements a and b are true about the relationship between network virtualization and SDNs. Network virtualization enables the creation of logical networks separate from the underlying physical infrastructure, which is a prerequisite for separating the data and control planes in SDNs. At the same time, the separation of data and control planes in SDNs makes it easier to manage and orchestrate virtual network topologies. So network virtualization and SDN are complementary technologies that enable each other, but one is not strictly dependent on the other.","['https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/software-defined-networking', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/software-defined-networking/what-is-sdn.html', 'https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/sdn/topics/concept/sdn-vnf-overview.html']",0,7_virtual_networking,0.9,1,(a) is simply false.
