Class B addresses have a default subnet mask of 255.255.0.0. However, it's a common practice to subnet Class B addresses to have a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, which is why option b is also considered correct in many practical scenarios. The network ID for a Class B address would be the first two octets (172.16 in this case), not 172.0.0.0 as option a suggests. The number of host bits in an unsubnetted Class B network is 16, which corresponds to the third and fourth octet (option d). However, the question does not specify whether the network is subnetted or not, so this information cannot be determined solely from the IP address given. Lastly, the broadcast address for the network would be the last address in the network or subnet range, not necessarily 172.255.255.255 as option e suggests, as this assumes a single Class B network without further subnetting.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classful_network', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork', 'https://www.ripe.net/about-us/press-centre/understanding-ip-addressing']",0,chapter3_ipv4_addressing,0.9,0.731014602226371,Misses the word ‘default’ in the question and ‘unsubnetted’ in question ,Misinterpreting questions,Misinterpreting a word,,,1,3,"wikipedia, wikipedia, trusted article",3,1,1,0,Basic networking,3,3,2,2,0.1999999999999999

Class A network IDs range from 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0, with some special exceptions like 127.0.0.0, which is reserved for loopback addresses. The defining characteristic of a Class A address is that the first bit of the first octet is '0', which means any address from 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 is considered Class A.
