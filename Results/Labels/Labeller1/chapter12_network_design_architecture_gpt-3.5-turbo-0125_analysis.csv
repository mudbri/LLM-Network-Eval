210,Which of the following roles of campus switches aggregates distribution switches in very large campus LANs?,"a. Access
b. Distribution
c. Core
d. Campus
",c,b,"The role of aggregating distribution switches in very large campus LANs is typically performed by the distribution switches themselves. Therefore, the correct option in this case is 'b. Distribution.'

211,Your company plans to start using public cloud service and now you are considering different WAN options. Your main concern is security by keeping the data private while also providing good QoS services. Which of the following options are under consideration? (Choose two answers.),"a. Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider
b. Using an Internet connection without VPN
c. Using an Internet connection with VPN
d. Using an intercloud exchange
","a,d","a,c","Option a (Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider) is a secure way to connect to the public cloud while maintaining data privacy. This option ensures that data travels over a dedicated private connection, offering better security and QoS. Option c (Using an Internet connection with VPN) is another secure option as VPN (Virtual Private Network) provides encryption and secure tunneling over the public Internet, ensuring data privacy and security.",[],0,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.9,0.999999135960423,Does not identify that VLAN would not be good for QoS.

213,"A company uses a Metro Ethernet WAN with an Ethernet LAN (E-LAN) service, with the company headquarters plus 20 remote sites connected to the service. The enterprise uses OSPF at all sites, with one router connected to the service from each site. Which of the following are true about the Layer 3 details most likely used with this service and design? (Choose all that apply)","a. The WAN uses one IP subnet
b. The WAN uses 20 or more IP subnets
c. A remote site router would have one OSPF neighbor
d. A remote site router would have 20 OSPF neighbors","a,d","a,c","The WAN most likely uses one IP subnet because Metro Ethernet WAN typically operates as a single broadcast domain, hence utilizing a single IP subnet.
