101,What are some of the features that an SDX enables that today's IXPs cannot support? Select all that apply.,"a. Application of different business relationships across different regions of the world (e.g., peering only in a specific geographic region).
b. Application-specific peering
c. Wide-area load balancing using DNS-based redirection
d. On-the-fly redirection to middleboxes
e. Wide-area load balancing using IP packet rewriting
","b,d,e","a,b,d","An SDX (Software Defined Exchange) enables several features that traditional Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) cannot support, including: a) Applying different business relationships across different regions, allowing peering to be restricted to specific geographic areas. b) Application-specific peering, where peering relationships can be established based on the application or traffic type. d) On-the-fly redirection of traffic to middleboxes for services like security filtering, load balancing, etc. The other options, c) and e), relate to wide-area load balancing techniques that are not specifically enabled by SDX capabilities.","['https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi14/nsdi14-paper-gupta.pdf', 'https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/papers/sdx-sigcomm13.pdf']",0,13_SDN_use_cases,0.9,1,(a) is typically possible with ISPs,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,1,research paper,0,1,1,1,Advanced networking,3,3,2,3,,0.1999999999999999
