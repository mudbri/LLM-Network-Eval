36,What ordering of TCP flags make up the Three-Way Handshake?,"a. SYN, ACK, FIN
b. SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK
c. FIN, FIN/ACK, ACK
d. SYN, ACK, SYN, ACK
",,b,b,,"The Three-Way Handshake in TCP is used to establish a connection between two hosts. It consists of three steps: 1) The client sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server to initiate the connection. 2) The server responds with a SYN/ACK packet, acknowledging the client's SYN and sending its own SYN. 3) The client sends an ACK packet to acknowledge the server's SYN, completing the connection establishment.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross', 'TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols by W.

b. 4
c. 32
d. 8",,a,a,,The port field in transport layer protocols like TCP and UDP is 16 bits long. This allows for port numbers ranging from 0 to 65535.

b. Router
c. Switch
d. Firewall
",,d,d,,"A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules. Firewalls can be hardware, software, or a combination of both. They are designed to establish a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks, such as the Internet. Firewalls block traffic that meets certain criteria, such as specific IP addresses, ports, or protocols, to prevent unauthorized access and potential security threats.","['Kurose, J. F., & Ross, K.

b. PSH
c. URG
d. RST

d. System ports
",,b,b,,Ephemeral ports are identified as ports 49152 through 65535. These ports are dynamically allocated by the client's operating system whenever a client application requests an outbound connection. They are temporary ports used for the duration of the client-server session and are released once the session ends.,"['IANA Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry', 'RFC 6335 - Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Procedures for the Management of the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry']",1,3_transport_application_layer,0.95,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

b. ARP message
c. The source port
d. The router

The networking stack is responsible for managing network communications and protocols, including TCP. When an application needs to establish a TCP connection, it makes a request to the operating system's networking stack, which then handles the details of setting up the connection.","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by James Kurose and Keith Ross', 'TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols by W.
