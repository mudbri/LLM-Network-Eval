1,Which of the following are true about Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)? Select all that apply.,"a. The only sizes for an IP address allocation before CIDR were 8, 16, or 24 bits.
b. The prefix length for a CIDR prefix can be anywhere in the range from 0 to 32 bits.
c. In an Internet forwarding table with CIDR, there can only be one unique matching entry for any given IP address.
d. CIDR slowed the rate of Internet routing table growth because prefixes no longer had to be allocated in fixed-size blocks.",,"b,d","b,d",,"CIDR allows for variable-length subnet masks, with prefix lengths ranging from 0 to 32 bits. This enables more efficient allocation of IP address blocks compared to the fixed sizes of 8, 16, or 24 bits used in classful addressing.

2,Which of the following are true about how DNS lookups work? Select all that apply.,"a. A DNS A-record query for google.com will only return a single IP address at a time.
b. An NS-record query for a DNS lookup will return the name(s) of the authoritative name server(s) for that domain.
c. If your local DNS resolver caches an NS record for google.com for multiple days, all clients who use that DNS resolver will continue using the same IP address to reach Google’s Web server until that NS record expires.

6,Which of the following are true about content distribution networks? Select all that apply.,"a. Content distribution networks can improve the performance that a client sees by reducing the network latency between the client and the content that it is downloading.
b. Content distribution networks can reduce transit expenses for a content provider by enabling much of the provider’s content to be served from a nearby network, sometimes even from a cache that is within the client’s own network.
c. Real-time content such as video streams cannot be distributed from a content distribution network.

7,Which of the following are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control? Select all that apply.,"a. Only wireless networks can have collisions at the receiver; such collisions are not possible on wired Ethernet networks.
b. Using RTS/CTS (“request to send”, “clear to send”) control reduces the overall achievable throughput of the wireless network.
c. A wireless sender can avoid causing a collision at the receiver by performing a “carrier sense” to determine whether any other sender wants to transmit at the time that it wishes to send a packet.
d. Disabling RTS/CTS necessarily lowers the effective throughput of the wireless network, since more collisions will occur at the receiver without RTS/CTS enabled.
",,b,"b,c",,"Both options b and c are true about 802.11 wireless medium access control. Using RTS/CTS does reduce overall throughput because of the additional control overhead, but it helps avoid collisions caused by hidden terminals.

Option d is false because disabling RTS/CTS can sometimes improve throughput if the overhead of the control frames outweighs the cost of additional collisions.","['802.11 Wireless Networks: The Definitive Guide, 2nd Edition by Matthew Gast', 'Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1,1,1,1,3,"The subtle confusion in this question was the description of the choice.

8,Which of the following are true about video streaming? Select all that apply.,"a. Using UDP to stream a video instead of TCP is appropriate if the client is more concerned about low delay and interactivity than it does about receiving a high-quality stream.
b. A larger playout buffer at the client allows the client more time to recover from lost packets.
c. Using TCP for video streaming could result in larger delays between transmission and playout than streaming the same video with UDP.
d. Since UDP provides no reliable delivery guarantees, a video streaming application that uses UDP as its transport cannot recover from any packet loss in the video stream.
",,"a,b,c","a,b,c",,"Using UDP for video streaming is appropriate when low delay and interactivity are more important than receiving a high-quality stream (a).

9,Which of the following are true about TCP? Select all that apply.,"a. TCP guarantees that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted.
b. A TCP sender and receiver use a “three-way handshake” both to set up and to terminate the TCP connection.
c. TCP’s congestion avoidance algorithm causes the sender to reduce its sending rate by a factor of two when it sees a packet loss.
d. A TCP sender controls its sending rate by adjusting the number of unacknowledged packets that can be sent over the network at any time.
",,"a,c,d","a,d",,"Options a and d are correct about TCP. TCP does guarantee that the receiver sees the same in-order stream of bytes that the sender transmitted, providing reliable data transfer (a). TCP also uses a congestion window to control the number of unacknowledged packets that can be in transit, adjusting the sending rate (d). However, TCP uses a three-way handshake only to establish the connection, not to terminate it (b is incorrect). And while TCP does react to packet loss, it does not always reduce the sending rate by a factor of two - that depends on the specific congestion control algorithm being used (c is incorrect).","['Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross, Section 3.5', 'TCP congestion control - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control']",0,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1,1,1,1,5,Conceptual issue since TCP does indeed half the sending rate,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,Wrong Facts/Concept,Incorrect information/concept,,,0,2,"book, wikipedia",2,,1,1,Misinformation and debugging delay,1,TCP,"misinformation, debugging delay",Minor,1,3,3,2,1,0.5
10,Which of the following are true about denial of service attacks (and defenses)? Select all that apply.,"a. If every network on the Internet performed stateless ingress filtering to defend against source IP spoofing, the DNS reflection attack would not work.
b. If every network on the Internet performed stateless egress filtering to defend against source IP address spoofing, the DNS reflection attack could not be carried out.
c. In a “SYN Flood” attack, each TCP SYN packet that a victim receives causes it to set up TCP connection state.
d. A “DNS Reflection” attack requires the attacking client to “spoof” the source IP address of the packet containing the DNS request.
",,"b,c,d","b,c,d",,"Options b, c, and d are all correct statements about denial of service attacks and defenses:b) If all networks implemented egress filtering to prevent source IP spoofing, attackers would not be able to spoof the victim's IP as the source of DNS requests in a reflection attack.c) In a SYN flood, each received SYN causes the victim to allocate resources for a half-open TCP connection, potentially exhausting resources. d) DNS reflection attacks rely on the attacker spoofing the victim's IP as the source of many DNS requests, so the DNS servers' replies overwhelm the victim.Option a is incorrect because ingress filtering at the destination cannot prevent the victim from receiving the reflected DNS replies in a reflection attack.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack', 'https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/bcp38', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/dns-amplification-ddos-attack/']",1,1_SDN_Basics,0.95,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
