QoS can manage bandwidth (a) by allocating a minimum amount of bandwidth for certain types of traffic. It can manage packet loss (c) by prioritizing important traffic and dropping less important packets during congestion. QoS can manage delay (d) by ensuring that high-priority packets are processed and forwarded first. Finally, QoS can manage jitter (f), the variation in delay, by using techniques like traffic shaping and policing to smooth out the traffic flow.
