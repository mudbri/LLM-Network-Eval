204,"The customer edge device is typically a router, that sits at a customer site on MPLS networks and connects to a provider edge router (PE router) to take communications from a customer site to a provider side.","a. TRUE
b. FALSE
",,a,a,,"The statement is true. In an MPLS network, the customer edge (CE) device, typically a router, is located at the customer's premises. It connects to the provider edge (PE) router, which is the entry point into the service provider's MPLS network. The CE router is responsible for forwarding customer traffic to the PE router, which then uses MPLS labels to transport the traffic across the provider's network to the destination.","['MPLS Fundamentals by Luc De Ghein, Cisco Press', 'RFC 4364 - BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)', 'Cisco Documentation: MPLS VPN Technology Overview']",1,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

This means there is a direct link between each pair of nodes, allowing for maximum redundancy and performance. However, this also makes full mesh very costly and impractical for large networks due to the high number of connections required.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1 by Wendell Odom', 'https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/ios-nx-os-software/what-is-network-topology.html']",1,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

211,Your company plans to start using public cloud service and now you are considering different WAN options. Your main concern is security by keeping the data private while also providing good QoS services. Which of the following options are under consideration? (Choose two answers.),"a. Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider
b. Using an Internet connection without VPN
c. Using an Internet connection with VPN
d. Using an intercloud exchange
",,"a,d","a,c",,"When connecting to public cloud services, the two best options for maintaining data privacy and providing good QoS are: a) Using private WAN connections directly to the cloud provider, and c) Using an Internet connection with VPN. Private WAN connections, like dedicated leased lines or MPLS, provide secure, isolated connectivity to the cloud provider's network. A VPN over the public Internet encrypts the data, keeping it private, while also allowing QoS policies to prioritize critical traffic. The other choices, using the Internet without VPN or an intercloud exchange, do not inherently provide the required level of security and QoS control for this scenario.","['CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Wendell Odom, Cisco Press, 2020', 'Cisco SD-WAN: Cloud Scale Architecture, Kiran Ghodgaonkar, Cisco Press, 2022', 'Cisco Networking Academy: Introduction to Networks v7.0, Cisco Press, 2020']",0,chapter12_network_design_architecture,0.95,1,1,1,3,4,Does not identify that VLAN would not be good for QoS.
